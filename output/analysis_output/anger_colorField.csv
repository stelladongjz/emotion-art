after-the-cloud.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, with its soft, blended hues of green and blue, and a subtle orange horizon, evokes a sense of calm, tranquility, and perhaps even contemplative peace. There are no elements within the composition that could be interpreted as angry or aggressive. The colors are harmonious and do not clash; there are no sharp, jagged lines, violent brushstrokes, or chaotic forms typically associated with anger. The gradient transitions are smooth and gentle, and the overall impression is one of serenity rather than conflict or frustration. Therefore, the emotion of anger is virtually absent from this visual experience. The score is not an absolute zero only to acknowledge the inherent subjectivity in any emotional response to art, however minimal."
aberddeen-i-1970.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting does not evoke any sense of anger. The color palette, composed primarily of soft, muted tones of light grey/off-white for the background, combined with delicate pastel shades of light blue and pink for the lines and drips, actively works against any aggressive or volatile emotional response. These colors are typically associated with calmness, serenity, or even a gentle melancholy, rather than intensity or rage. The lines themselves, while forming an incomplete rectangular frame and featuring drips, are not sharp, jagged, or chaotic in a way that suggests frustration or aggression. Instead, they appear fluid and almost ethereal, with the drips creating a natural, organic flow rather than a violent outburst. There are no harsh contrasts, clashing elements, or dynamic tension that would contribute to a feeling of anger. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, softness, or perhaps a wistful mood, making the presence of anger completely absent in its visual language."
19-1963-1963.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting predominantly features large fields of soft pink and reddish hues, separated by a gentle, slightly undulating white vertical line. There are very few elements within this artwork that would typically evoke or represent anger. The colors, while warm, are not intense, fiery reds, nor are they harsh or clashing; instead, they lean towards softer, more contemplative shades of rose and coral, which are often associated with calm, warmth, or even tenderness rather than fury. The white line is organic and slightly imperfect, conveying a sense of handmade simplicity rather than sharp aggression or rigid confrontation. The overall composition is balanced and serene, lacking any jagged lines, chaotic brushstrokes, violent contrasts, or turbulent forms that might suggest agitation, frustration, or wrath. The large, expansive color fields tend to promote a sense of quiet contemplation or a gentle embrace, which stands in direct opposition to the visual language of anger. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, the specific tonality and context within this piece steer it far away from that emotional register. The absence of any disruptive or forceful visual cues means that anger is barely, if at all, communicated by this artwork."
alya-1964.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork does not evoke any sense of anger. The primary colors used, a subdued green and a soft orange-red, are not inherently aggressive or jarring; in fact, they contribute to a rather calm and balanced visual. The shapes themselves are organic, rounded, and symmetrical, lacking any sharp angles, jagged edges, or chaotic forms typically associated with feelings of anger, frustration, or aggression. The repetitive, orderly arrangement of the four identical elements creates a sense of pattern and stability rather than conflict or tension. There are no disturbing elements, harsh contrasts, or dynamic movements that might suggest rage or indignation. The overall impression is one of serenity and simplicity, entirely devoid of any visual cues that could be interpreted as angry or agitating."
1.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The painting, with its deep, resonant fields of color, evokes a profound sense of solemnity and introspection rather than the volatile emotion of anger. The hues, dominated by a rich, dark reddish-brown and deep blues, are contemplative and weighty, lacking the sharp, jarring contrasts or vibrant, aggressive tones typically associated with rage or fury. The soft, feathered edges of the color blocks, characteristic of Rothko's style, prevent any harshness or abruptness, instead fostering a sense of gentle diffusion and interconnectedness. There are no agitated brushstrokes, turbulent forms, or dynamic lines that would suggest an outburst or intense frustration. The horizontal arrangement contributes to a feeling of stillness and meditative calm. While the painting possesses a powerful emotional intensity, this intensity manifests as a deep, resonant profundity or a quiet, internal melancholy, not as an outward or active expression of anger. Any interpretation of anger would be highly tenuous and indirect, perhaps only as a deeply internalized and sublimated component of a broader, more somber emotional landscape, rather than a direct or dominant feeling conveyed by the visual elements themselves."
alruccabah-1964.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this painting that evokes a sense of anger. The artwork is characterized by soft, organic, and flowing shapes, rather than sharp, jagged, or aggressive lines that might suggest tension or hostility. The colors employed—a serene blue, an earthy green, a warm reddish-brown, and a creamy off-white—are harmonious and muted, completely lacking the harshness, intensity, or fiery vibrancy often associated with rage or frustration. There are no violent brushstrokes, chaotic compositions, or confrontational forms. Instead, the piece exudes a meditative and tranquil atmosphere, with its undulating contours creating a sense of gentle movement and calm. The balanced and symmetrical arrangement further contributes to a feeling of peace and stability, offering no visual cues that would trigger or reflect anger."
867-97-vulcano-1997.jpg,colorField,38.0,"The primary element contributing to a sense of anger in this painting is the dominant use of the color red. Red is universally associated with strong emotions, including passion, energy, and critically, anger or aggression. The vibrancy of the upper red field suggests an intense, powerful emotional state, which, when considered in the context of anger, could represent a feeling of being heated or on the verge of eruption.

Furthermore, the distinct, jagged, and somewhat turbulent line at the bottom, where the vibrant red transitions into a darker, more textured, and almost frothy reddish-brown, suggests agitation and unrest. This transition could be interpreted as a simmering or boiling state, like a wave of anger rising or a raw, volatile core. The darker hue at the bottom, combined with the irregular texture, lends a more visceral and potentially aggressive quality compared to the smoother upper portion.

However, the score is not higher because the painting lacks overtly aggressive or chaotic visual cues often associated with anger. The overall circular composition suggests containment and a certain completeness, rather than explosive rage. There are no violent brushstrokes across the entire canvas, no clashing colors, and no sharp, confrontational forms that would explicitly convey hostility or fury. The agitation is confined to the lower segment, acting more as a textural foundation or an underlying current rather than an overwhelming outburst. Therefore, while the color red and the subtle turmoil at the base introduce a hint of anger, it feels more like a deep, powerful emotion that *could* lead to anger, or anger that is contained and simmering, rather than an active, expressed state of rage."
29-03-60-1960.jpg,colorField,82.0,"The painting strongly conveys anger through its deliberate use of color and composition. The overwhelming presence of deep, saturated reds across much of the canvas immediately evokes this emotion, as red is universally associated with intensity, aggression, and fury. The rich maroon in the top left block suggests a simmering, brooding form of anger, a deep-seated resentment or displeasure. In contrast, the vibrant, almost blood-red expanse at the bottom feels more active and forceful, akin to a surge of powerful, unyielding rage. The large, stark black rectangle on the top right significantly amplifies this feeling; black can represent the heavy, oppressive, or even destructive aspects of anger, its all-consuming nature. The sharp, almost fluorescent yellow outlines bordering the black rectangle create a jarring, confrontational visual impact, akin to a sudden, piercing outburst or the sharp edge of an aggressive statement. The rigid, blocky composition, with its blunt, unyielding geometric forms, conveys a sense of inflexibility and direct confrontation, mirroring the unyielding nature often associated with anger. Furthermore, the raw, visible brushstrokes and the slightly rough, uncontained quality of the outer borders, particularly the streaks of orange and red, suggest a primal, unbridled emotional force that has burst forth, unable to be fully contained. The overall visual weight and tension generated by these elements combine to produce a powerful and undeniable sensation of anger."
318-61-1961.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The artwork displays a smooth, gradient transition from bright yellow and orange at the top to deep red and maroon at the bottom. While the color red is frequently associated with anger due to its intensity and historical symbolism, the overall visual language of this particular piece does very little to evoke the emotion of anger.

The most significant factor mitigating anger is the controlled and harmonious nature of the gradient itself. There are no harsh lines, aggressive brushstrokes, chaotic forms, or sharp contrasts that typically communicate rage or conflict. Instead, the seamless blending of colors suggests a gentle progression, a sense of tranquility, or a contained intensity rather than an outburst of emotion. This smoothness prevents any feeling of agitation or turmoil commonly linked with anger.

The intense reds at the bottom, while powerful, lean more towards conveying profound depth, warmth, or passionate energy rather than an aggressive or furious state. It suggests a simmering intensity or a deep, rich emotional core, which is distinct from explosive anger. The clear white borders further frame and contain the color field, preventing it from feeling overwhelming or chaotic, which could otherwise contribute to a sense of unease or irritation. Therefore, any feeling of anger derived from this image is extremely subtle and indirect, stemming almost exclusively from a broad association with the color red's potential for intensity, rather than specific visual cues for rage or aggression within the artwork'"
1952-a-1952.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The painting evokes a significant degree of anger through several compelling visual elements, though it's more akin to a brooding, deeply felt, or intensely simmering anger rather than an explosive rage. The dominant fields of deep, almost black, blue convey a heavy, somber, and profoundly intense atmosphere, which can signify the oppressive weight of internalized anger or resentment. The agitated and textured brushwork within these dark blue areas, characterized by streaking, dripping, and varying opacity, creates a sense of profound unrest and turbulent energy. This raw, uncontained application of paint directly reflects the internal turmoil and agitation often associated with the powerful emotional state of anger.

Furthermore, the sharp, thin vertical red line subtly piercing through the broad blue band on the left is a potent visual trigger for anger. Red is universally associated with this emotion, and its stark, almost wounding presence"
apricot-ripple-1968.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The painting, composed of numerous vertical stripes of varying colors, elicits an extremely low sense of anger. The orderly and repetitive nature of the stripes creates a sense of rhythm and structure, rather than chaos or agitation. While there is a wide range of colors present, including some brighter tones like red and yellow, they are integrated within a palette that includes many softer pastels, muted earth tones (like olive green and brown), and gentle blues and purples. There are no harsh or jarring color combinations that would evoke discomfort or aggression. The clean lines and uniform application of paint contribute to a sense of precision and calm, lacking the raw, expressive, or chaotic elements often associated with feelings of anger. There are no violent or confrontational forms, no aggressive brushstrokes, and no disorienting visual elements. The overall impression is one of visual harmony and contemplative regularity, which directly counteracts any potential for eliciting a feeling of anger."
appleby-2011.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element in this artwork that conveys or evokes the emotion of anger. The composition consists of three vertically oriented, light-colored panels, likely made of a textured, perhaps handmade, paper. The dominant hues are soft, neutral creams and off-whites, which are inherently calming and devoid of the fiery, intense, or dark tones typically associated with anger. The lines are straightforward and vertical, lacking any jaggedness, harshness, or frantic energy that could suggest aggression or turmoil. The texture, while visible, appears organic and natural rather than abrasive or violent. The overall impression is one of tranquility, simplicity, and quiet contemplation. There are no figures, narratives, or expressive gestures to imply frustration, rage, or any form of emotional outburst. The minimalist aesthetic and the serene palette actively work against any interpretation of anger, placing it at the absolute zero end of the scale for this emotion."
all-night-1989.jpg,colorField,72.0,"The painting evokes a significant degree of anger, primarily conveyed through the striking and assertive horizontal band of deep, saturated red positioned prominently across the mid-ground. Red is universally associated with intense emotions, and in this context, its strong, unyielding presence speaks directly to feelings of fury, defiance, or profound irritation. The sharp, clean edges of this red band, creating a stark division, suggest an unyielding boundary or a line drawn in strong contention, which is a common manifestation of anger.

Further contributing to this emotional intensity is the expansive, dark, and heavy blue expanse above the red. While blue can evoke calm, this particular shade, combined with its sweeping, somewhat turbulent brushstrokes, creates an oppressive or foreboding atmosphere. This can be interpreted as the weight of simmering anger, a brooding intensity, or the turbulent emotional state that often precedes or accompanies a strong outburst. The visible brushwork in the blue, though not overtly aggressive, still conveys a sense of agitation or unease.

The stark contrast between the intense red and the dark blue, set against the bright, perhaps vulnerable, yellow field below, creates a palpable tension within the composition. This visual tension mirrors the internal conflict or confrontational energy inherent in anger. The vertical, somewhat ethereal shapes (possibly tree trunks) reaching upwards into the dark blue, while not explicitly angry, can be seen as struggling against or enduring the oppressive weight above, adding to a sense of struggle or resilience that can stem from deep-seated anger.

However, the anger is not depicted as chaotic or explosive. The clear, defined horizontal bands introduce a sense of order and containment, preventing the emotion from reaching a full-blown, destructive rage. There are no jagged lines, shattered forms, or frenetic brushstrokes that would suggest unbridled fury. Instead, it feels like a powerful, deeply rooted, and perhaps enduring anger, asserted rather than unleashed. This calculated intensity, driven by the dominant red and the heavy blue, places the emotional resonance of anger at a strong, yet not overwhelming, level."
ayin-1958.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting exhibits no visual characteristics typically associated with the emotion of anger. The palette consists of soft, muted, and translucent colors such as gentle blues, pinks, greens, and browns, which are far removed from the sharp, vibrant, or aggressive hues (like harsh reds or fiery oranges) often used to convey rage or fury. The brushstrokes are predominantly vertical and flowing, creating a sense of calm descent or ethereal movement, rather than the agitated, chaotic, or sharp marks that might express frustration or aggression. Furthermore, the overall composition is balanced and symmetrical, with the colors gently fanning out and dissolving into the white space, contributing to a serene and contemplative atmosphere. There are no jarring contrasts, sharp angles, turbulent forms, or disruptive elements that could evoke feelings of tension, hostility, or outright anger. The artwork's gentle flow and harmonious blending of colors actively counter any sense of discord or indignation."
attacca-1975.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The painting displays a collection of vibrant, distinct brushstrokes on a neutral, pale background. There are very few elements within this artwork that would evoke a sense of anger. The colors, while diverse and bold (including pink, green, blue, red, yellow, orange), are not used in a jarring or clashing manner that typically signifies rage or aggression. Instead, they appear as individual, almost playful marks. The brushstrokes themselves are relatively smooth and elongated, suggesting deliberate yet fluid application rather than frenetic, violent, or destructive energy often associated with angry expression in art. There are no sharp, jagged forms, chaotic compositions, or heavy, agitated textures that might convey frustration or fury. The overall impression is one of dynamic movement and lively color, which leans more towards energy or even cheerfulness than any form of aggression or wrath. The neutral background also acts as a calming base, further diffusing any potential for negative emotional interpretation from the vibrant marks. While the scattering of elements could be loosely interpreted as a form of energetic release, it lacks any visual cues (such as tension, discord, or confrontational forms) that would specifically link it to anger."
archimandrite-1960.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The painting evokes a significant degree of anger through several compelling visual cues. Primarily, the stark and forceful vertical division created by the broad, thick white band powerfully dissects the canvas, suggesting a profound and unyielding conflict or separation. This visual ""cutting"" or tearing quality within the composition mirrors the disruptive and often violent nature of anger itself. The brushwork, particularly in this dominant white stripe, appears raw and unrefined, conveying a sense of untamed, visceral energy and a forceful application that aligns with the raw emotional output of anger.

Furthermore, the heavy and brooding presence of the deep, intense blues and the rich, somewhat dark green contribute to an atmosphere of solemn weight and underlying tension. These colors, especially in their somber intensity, can suggest suppressed emotions, frustration, or a smoldering intensity that precedes or accompanies anger. The large, irregular block of green on the right, with its slightly jagged and uneven upper edge, carries an almost confrontational or turbulent quality, hinting at an underlying struggle or aggressive stance within the composition. While not depicting an explosive, outwardly chaotic rage, the rigid verticality, the stark contrasts, and the palpable sense of forceful containment within the painting effectively convey a deep-seated, perhaps simmering, and unyielding anger or the profound emotional conditions that give rise to it."
amarillo-1971.jpg,colorField,17.0,"The painting evokes a very low, almost subliminal level of anger, manifesting more as a mild irritation or a sense of unsettled tension rather than outright rage. This subtle agitation stems primarily from the sharp, diagonal line that starkly divides the two expansive fields of bright yellow. This ""cut"" or ""split"" can be perceived as an aggressive act of separation, a definitive barrier that creates an implicit conflict or an unyielding boundary. There's a visual tension in how the white space narrows, suggesting a point of intense pressure or a decisive break, which can be subtly unsettling. Furthermore, the intense, unmodulated yellow, while often associated with cheerfulness, here presents itself as almost confrontational in its starkness and uniformity, especially when juxtaposed with the stark white divide. It demands attention, and its pervasive brightness, combined with the sharp geometry, can contribute to a feeling of slight visual imposition or agitation. The lack of visual resolution, where separation is the dominant theme, subtly frustrates any desire for harmony or cohesion, contributing to this very minor undercurrent of irritation."
banjo-1981.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The artwork evokes virtually no sense of anger. Anger is typically conveyed through visual elements such as harsh, clashing colors, aggressive or jagged lines, chaotic and disordered compositions, or violent and energetic brushwork. This painting, however, presents a rhythmic arrangement of vertical stripes. While there are contrasts in color (blues, yellows, and reddish tones), these contrasts are not jarring or aggressive; instead, they blend and interact in a visually harmonious or at least non-confrontational manner. The edges of the stripes are somewhat soft and varied, lacking the sharp intensity often associated with feelings of rage or frustration. The overall impression is one of visual rhythm and a controlled, if slightly irregular, pattern. There are no chaotic bursts, no dominant fiery hues, nor any sense of struggle or agitation in the execution. Consequently, the visual language of the painting actively works against the evocation of anger, rendering it an almost entirely absent emotion in the viewer's experience."
beta-lambda-1961.jpg,colorField,7.5,"The visual elements within this painting offer very little to evoke a sense of anger. While some vibrant reds and oranges are present, often associated with strong emotions, they are balanced by a wide spectrum of other bright and earthy colors, preventing any single hue from dominating and conveying aggression. There is no sharp, jagged, or forceful linearity that typically communicates rage or frustration; instead, the lines are fluid, almost organic, and exhibit a distinct dripping quality. This fluidity suggests a natural flow or perhaps a spontaneous, expressive gesture rather than a violent or uncontrolled outburst born of anger. The composition, with its large, open central space and the contained, albeit dynamic, V-shapes on either side, creates a sense of balance and visual quietude rather than the chaotic or confrontational energy often found in angry expressions. There are no harsh contrasts, disturbing textures, or aggressive forms that would typically manifest anger visually. The overall impression is one of vibrancy and movement, but it is a controlled, almost playful, or decorative movement, entirely devoid of the tension, turmoil, or explosive energy characteristic of anger."
autumn-leaves-fluttering-in-the-breeze-1973.jpg,colorField,12.5,"The painting exhibits a vibrant and somewhat agitated energy primarily through its dominant, intense orange-red hues and fragmented forms. This intensity can be loosely associated with the ""heat"" or high energy sometimes characteristic of an angry state. The numerous, irregularly shaped patches, almost mosaic-like, could subtly suggest a sense of fragmentation or disquiet, as if something is broken or unsettled, which might stem from or lead to anger. The dynamic, almost chaotic arrangement of these elements, combined with the strong contrast against the vivid blues and occasional flashes of lime green, creates a visually arresting and somewhat restless composition.

However, the connection to anger remains very weak and largely indirect. The colors, while intense, also carry connotations of warmth, autumn, energy, and even joy, particularly when combined with the bright blue and yellow/green. There is no explicit visual language of aggression, violence, destruction, or overt conflict. The forms are abstract and do not depict angry figures, destructive acts, or threatening environments. The fragmentation could equally represent natural phenomena like autumn leaves or dappled light, rather than emotional turmoil. The vibrancy could be interpreted as spirited and lively rather than rageful. Therefore, while there's a definite intensity and agitated quality, it falls far short of conveying genuine anger, which typically requires more overt visual cues of aggression, distress, or hostility. The impression is more one of dynamic energy and visual complexity than raw, potent anger."
beth-zayin-1959.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The depiction of anger in this artwork is remarkably low. While the painting utilizes a dominant palette of dark, deep hues such as browns, blacks, and murky greens, which can sometimes convey intensity, they lack the characteristic sharpness, aggression, or chaotic energy typically associated with this emotion. The brushstrokes are predominantly fluid and washed, creating a sense of organic flow or a heavy, drooping curtain rather than violent, agitated movements. There are no harsh lines, jagged forms, or explosive bursts of color that would suggest a furious outburst. The occasional hints of brighter colors, such as red, blue, and purple, appear as subtle fringes or underlying layers, largely subdued by the darker washes, and do not contribute to a feeling of intense rage or confrontation. The drips visible at the bottom left suggest dissolution or a slow seep rather than a forceful impact. The overall atmosphere leans towards a somber, weighty, or even introspective mood, devoid of the volatile or aggressive qualities inherent in anger."
blue-and-yellow-and-red-orange-1965.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This artwork evokes virtually no sense of anger. The primary colors – blue, yellow, and red – are presented in a clean, flat manner without any aggressive textures or agitated brushwork. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, in this context, it is integrated into a balanced and harmonious palette, appearing as just one of three foundational colors rather than a dominant, passionate, or confrontational element. The shapes themselves are soft, rounded ovals, completely devoid of sharp angles, jagged edges, or chaotic forms that might suggest aggression, tension, or frustration. Furthermore, the composition is highly organized and orderly, with the shapes neatly stacked upon one another. This vertical arrangement conveys stability and balance, rather than conflict, disruption, or an impending sense of collapse or agitation. There is no dynamic movement, visual tension, or expressive distortion that could be interpreted as a manifestation of anger. The overall impression is one of simplicity, calm, and perhaps a meditative tranquility, making any association with anger extremely unlikely and almost imperceptible."
black-on-maroon-1.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The painting evokes very little anger due to its visual characteristics. The color palette consists of deep, muted, earthy tones of dark reddish-brown and near-black, which tend to convey solemnity, introspection, or gravity rather than the fiery, sharp, or clashing hues often associated with anger or rage. There is an absence of vibrant reds, oranges, or stark contrasts that might typically signify aggression or intensity. Furthermore, the forms are rendered with soft, blurred edges, characteristic of Rothko's style. These gentle transitions lack the jagged lines, sharp angles, or violent brushstrokes that would typically communicate agitation or hostility. The overall composition is symmetrical and balanced, featuring two stable, monumental vertical forms. This creates a sense of stillness and contemplation rather than chaos, conflict, or dynamic tension, which are often present in works expressing anger. The painting offers a quiet, almost meditative space, devoid of any visual cues that suggest outward aggression, internal turmoil, or explosive emotion. While the dark and heavy nature of the colors might evoke a sense of somberness or weight, it does not translate into an active feeling of anger; rather, it suggests a profound calm or perhaps a quiet melancholy that is far removed from the sharp, disruptive energy of anger."
backbone-1979.jpg,colorField,65.0,"The most striking element contributing to the sense of anger is the overwhelming and pervasive use of a deep, saturated red. This color is universally associated with intensity, passion, and, significantly, anger and aggression. The sheer volume of this dominant red across the composition creates a visual weight that can feel consuming or pressing, akin to the feeling of being overwhelmed by intense emotion. Furthermore, the finely drawn, almost vibrating horizontal lines that make up the red field suggest a strong, directional energy. While these lines are relatively ordered rather than chaotic, they convey a palpable sense of internal agitation or a simmering intensity, as if the emotion is constantly present and vibrating beneath the surface, rather than being explosive or fleeting. The visual texture implies a concentrated and potent emotional state. The slight, almost subtle curve of white emerging from the bottom right corner serves as a stark contrast, a point where the pervasive red seems to meet a boundary or an endpoint, subtly highlighting the contained force within the red field. This contributes to the"
blue-painting-2002.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The painting is a monochromatic field of deep, intense blue. Blue, as a color, is overwhelmingly associated with feelings of tranquility, serenity, calm, depth, and sometimes melancholy or introspection. It is rarely, if ever, linked to anger, which is more commonly evoked by colors like red, black, or highly saturated, clashing hues, or by agitated forms and chaotic compositions. There are no elements within this artwork—no aggressive brushstrokes, sharp lines, disruptive forms, or narrative content—that would suggest conflict, aggression, or rage. The surface texture, while present, appears uniform and deliberate rather than expressive of turmoil or forceful emotion. The overall impression conveyed by the piece is one of stillness, quiet contemplation, and perhaps an infinite expanse, all of which are antithetical to the dynamic, often turbulent, nature of anger. Therefore, the emotional resonance of anger is virtually non-existent when engaging with this painting."
blues-reds-1969.jpg,colorField,7.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this artwork. The primary element that could remotely evoke a sense of anger is the use of a bright, saturated red color, particularly in the large rectangular block on the right. Red is often culturally associated with strong emotions like passion, warning, or anger. However, this association is heavily diluted and almost entirely counteracted by the formal qualities of the composition. The red, like the other colors, is applied in a flat, uniform, and contained manner within precise, geometric shapes. There are no jagged lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or chaotic elements that would typically convey agitation, fury, or hostility. The overall impression is one of structured balance and color exploration rather than emotional outburst or turmoil. The dominant blues and the neutral background further stabilize the composition, preventing the red from becoming overwhelming or emotionally charged in a negative sense. Therefore, while a fleeting, almost subconscious association with anger might arise for some due to the red, the artwork's disciplined and static nature actively suppresses any genuine feeling of anger."
black-on-maroon-4.jpg,colorField,65.0,"The painting evokes a sense of deep, internalized, and pervasive anger rather than an explosive or outwardly aggressive rage. The color palette, dominated by profound, almost black, reddish-browns, conveys a heavy, oppressive atmosphere that can be deeply associated with brooding or unresolved anger. These are not bright, fiery reds of a sudden outburst, but rather the somber, weighty hues of sustained emotional turmoil or the aftermath of intense suffering.

The vertical streaks of lighter, raw-looking red cutting through the dark mass contribute significantly to this interpretation. They appear almost like bleeding wounds or raw nerves, suggesting intense pain, frustration, or a sense of being torn apart. This rawness and the slightly agitated, textured brushwork within these streaks hint at a simmering intensity, a profound disquiet that can very much manifest as anger. The overall composition, with its weighty central dark field bordered by similar dark tones, can evoke a feeling of confinement or suppression, which often fuels a deep-seated anger. It suggests an emotion that is profoundly felt and perhaps inescapable, rather than fleeting. While the painting also carries notes of melancholy or despair, anger is a strong underlying current, particularly the kind of anger that arises from deep-seated pain or a sense of injustice."
burnt-umber-ultra-marine-l-1981.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The presence of anger in this painting is exceptionally low. The artwork features large, dark, block-like forms against a lighter, muted background, bordered by soft, diffused edges of brown and beige. While the dark masses could potentially be interpreted as heavy or imposing, their rendering lacks any aggressive or volatile qualities typically associated with anger. There are no sharp, jagged lines, abrupt changes, or confrontational elements in the composition. The colors are somber and earthy, leaning towards a quiet melancholy or groundedness, rather than the vibrant, often jarring hues (like intense reds or clashing contrasts) that frequently signify rage or agitation. The edges of the dark shapes are blurred and organic, suggesting a gentle bleed or a natural process, which is counter to the harshness or tension of anger. The overall impression is one of stillness, weight, and perhaps a contemplative somberness, rather than an active, explosive, or agitated emotion. The painting exudes a sense of quietude and immobility, which is largely antithetical to the dynamic and often chaotic energy of anger. Any perception of anger would be highly subjective and fleeting, overshadowed by the painting's calm and grounded demeanor."
broad-turning-1958.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The painting elicits virtually no sense of anger. The primary elements that typically convey anger in visual art—such as sharp, aggressive lines, jarring or clashing colors (especially vibrant reds used in an assertive manner), chaotic compositions, or imagery depicting conflict, struggle, or destruction—are entirely absent here.

The color palette consists of muted, earthy tones—deep browns, olive greens, and subtle reddish-browns, with touches of ochre and yellow. These colors are harmonious and tend to evoke feelings of solemnity, groundedness, or perhaps melancholy, rather than intensity or aggression. While red can be associated with anger, the reddish tones in this painting are deeply subdued and integrated into the overall dark, earthy scheme, appearing more like rust or dried blood than a fiery, enraged hue.

The forms are primarily vertical and fluid, characterized by soft edges and a painterly quality suggesting washes or drips. There are no sharp angles or jagged shapes that would convey tension or hostility. The overall impression is one of quietude, stability, or even a gentle descent, which stands in stark contrast to the agitated or explosive energy associated with anger. The texture appears soft and absorbent, lacking any harshness or grit.

The composition is balanced and somewhat contemplative, with a heavy, dark mass at the bottom suggesting weight or foundation, and lighter areas framing the central forms. There is no sense of conflict, confrontation, or any dynamic force that would provoke an angry response. The painting's mood is introspective and somber, far removed from the volatile energy of anger. Therefore, the visual language of the artwork offers no cues or triggers for this particular emotion."
canto-xii-1964.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, ""Canto II,"" is a stark and minimalist composition featuring two vertical color fields: a vibrant, almost luminescent yellow on the left and a deep, textured green on the right, all set against a white border. There are no elements within this visual schema that provoke or reflect anger. The colors themselves, yellow and green, are not traditionally associated with this emotion; rather, they tend to evoke feelings of warmth, nature, or even calmness. The composition is highly ordered and symmetrical, lacking any chaotic lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or clashing forms that might suggest agitation or conflict. The textured quality of the green field, while not entirely smooth, is subtle and organic, not indicative of any violent or frustrated application. There is an absence of tension, struggle, or confrontational visual language. The overall impression is one of contemplative simplicity, balance, and visual purity, which stands in direct opposition to the agitated, disruptive nature of anger. The score is a nominal 0.5 rather than an absolute 0 to acknowledge the remote theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic personal association, but there is no objective or widely recognized visual trigger for anger in this piece."
canto-xi-1964.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The artwork, characterized by its minimalist abstraction featuring two large vertical blocks of color—a bright, uniform yellow on the left and a textured, dark green on the right—offers virtually no visual cues that would typically evoke anger. The color palette of yellow and green is more commonly associated with nature, freshness, or calm, rather than intense negative emotions like rage or aggression. There are no jarring or clashing color combinations that might cause discomfort or irritation.

The composition is starkly simple, consisting of a clear, stable vertical division. This geometric clarity and balance do not suggest conflict, chaos, or tension, which are often visual characteristics of anger. There are no jagged lines, dynamic or aggressive forms, or fragmented elements that could imply agitation or violence. The texture in the green block, while present, appears organic and consistent with printmaking techniques rather than conveying a sense of frenetic energy, harshness, or distress.

Furthermore, as an abstract piece, the artwork lacks any representational subject matter that could depict angry figures, violent actions, or distressing situations. The overall impression is one of visual order, simplicity, and a contemplative quietude. Therefore, the intrinsic visual language of this artwork provides almost no stimulus for an emotional response of anger, placing its capacity to evoke such a feeling at the lowest end of the spectrum."
carthage-1962.jpg,colorField,82.5,"The intense and dominant use of a vibrant, almost aggressive, red immediately registers as a color commonly associated with anger, rage, and elevated emotional states. This highly saturated hue creates a palpable sense of heat and urgency. Contrasting sharply with this is the sprawling, irregular black form that dominates the center of the canvas. The black mass itself, with its organic, blob-like extensions, appears almost like a volatile entity, its ""arms"" or ""tentacles"" reaching outwards into the red field. This outward thrust of the black forms, coupled with their somewhat amorphous and unsettling nature, conveys a sense of unrestrained energy and an aggressive, perhaps even explosive, expansion. The stark visual tension created by the high contrast between the deep black and the fiery red evokes a feeling of internal pressure and outward agitation. There is no softness or fluidity in the interaction; rather, the black seems to confront or even consume the red, reflecting the forceful and sometimes destructive nature of anger. The overall composition feels highly dynamic and charged, suggesting a moment of powerful emotional outburst or a sustained state of intense irritation that resonates strongly with the sensation of anger."
canto-iv-1963.jpg,colorField,5.2,"The artwork, dominated by an expanse of deep, velvety black, inherently carries a certain gravity and intensity. While black can be associated with power, seriousness, or the sublime, it can also, in certain contexts, convey a sense of oppression, a void, or an unyielding force. For a small subset of viewers, this overwhelming monochromatic presence, devoid of traditional comforting forms or vibrant color, might evoke a subtle feeling of discomfort or being confronted by an absolute. In very rare, highly subjective interpretations, this profound starkness could be tangentially linked to a nascent, underlying frustration or an almost imperceptible sense of being stifled, which could be a very distant precursor to anger.

However, the composition is fundamentally static, controlled, and balanced. The precise vertical ""zip"" serves to divide and simultaneously unify the black field, creating a sense of monumental stillness rather than agitated tension. There are no jagged lines, aggressive brushstrokes, chaotic forms, or clashing elements that typically signify overt rage, fury, or hostility. The piece's overall effect leans more towards contemplation, solemnity, or an encounter with the sublime and primal, rather than eliciting an active, volatile emotion like anger. Any connection to anger is thus extremely tenuous and arises more from an individual's potential discomfort with austerity or profundity, rather than the artwork itself embodying an angry disposition. The emotional resonance for anger is consequently very low, almost negligible."
canto-iii-1963.jpg,colorField,78.0,"The emotion of anger, while not overtly expressed through jagged lines or chaotic forms, is profoundly evoked in this work through its stark, monumental presence and particularly through its thematic implications. The vast, unyielding blackness dominates the canvas, creating an oppressive and confrontational visual field that demands attention. This overwhelming dark mass can be interpreted as a symbol of an inescapable force, a void of despair, or the weighty presence of judgment, all of which carry strong undercurrents of profound anger or the consequences of wrath. The single, stark white vertical ""zip"" cuts through this black expanse with an almost violent or surgical precision. It is not a gentle line but a forceful intervention, a sharp division, or perhaps a searing mark, which can be seen as an expression of severe, unyielding intensity that aligns with the nature of anger.

Crucially, the title ""Canto II"" (visible in the lower left) directly references Dante Alighieri's *Inferno*. This contextual link is paramount. The *Inferno* is a journey through Hell, a realm defined by divine wrath, punishment, and the severe consequences of sin. Canto II specifically marks the beginning of this harrowing descent. Within this framework, the artwork transforms into a visual embodiment of the somber, imposing, and unforgiving anger associated with divine judgment and the infernal landscape. The black becomes the oppressive darkness of hell, and the ""zip"" a chilling manifestation of an absolute, unwavering sentence or a painful spiritual wound. This is not a fleeting, impulsive anger, but a profound, solemn, and monumental form of anger, representing the inescapable, unyielding force of consequence and divine retribution. The lack of softer elements or color serves to amplify this unmit"
canto-xiii-1964.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The artwork evokes an exceptionally low level of anger, bordering on non-existent. There are virtually no visual cues within the piece that typically trigger or represent this emotion.

Firstly, the color palette consists of a luminous, warm yellow and a deep, muted olive-green/brown. Neither of these colors inherently carries connotations of anger, aggression, or rage. There is no jarring clash or violent contrast between them; instead, they exist in a balanced, juxtaposed harmony. A sense of anger is often conveyed through sharp, aggressive reds, oranges, or dark, turbulent tones, which are absent here.

Secondly, the composition is remarkably stable and minimalist. Two large, static vertical fields of color divide the space, creating a sense of monumentality and stillness. There are no dynamic lines, sharp angles, or chaotic forms that could suggest tension, conflict, or agitation. Anger often manifests visually through disruption, imbalance, or a sense of impending collision, none of which are present in this perfectly balanced and serene arrangement.

Lastly, the overall texture and execution, while showing some organic roughness typical of a printmaking process, do not convey a sense of violent or frenetic energy. The ""zips"" (vertical divisions) in Newman's work are typically understood as elements that define space and evoke a sense of presence or the sublime, rather than expressing human emotional turmoil. The piece offers a contemplative and somewhat stark experience, far removed from the agitated or aggressive feelings associated with anger. The dominant feeling is one of quiet contemplation or formal balance, which directly opposes the disruptive nature of anger."
cathedral-11-1968.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The artwork, composed of two panels featuring soft, vertical stripes of vibrant colors like yellow, orange, red, and teal, evokes sensations far removed from anger. The colors are bright and luminous, blending seamlessly into one another, which creates a sense of harmony and flow rather than discord or harshness. There are no sharp, aggressive lines or chaotic forms that might suggest agitation or fury. The composition is highly ordered and repetitive, conveying a sense of stability and rhythm rather than disruption or frustration. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, its presence here is integrated into a bright, almost glowing palette, feeling energetic and warm rather than intense or threatening. The overall effect is one of vibrancy and perhaps even tranquility, with the soft transitions between hues having a soothing effect. There is nothing visually jarring, confrontational, or oppressive that would trigger an emotional response of anger. The piece feels more meditative and visually pleasing than anything that would provoke irritation, rage, or any form of aggressive emotion."
corot-s-mark-1987.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The dominant color is a serene and expansive blue, a hue commonly associated with tranquility, calm, and introspection rather than agitation or fury. There are no sharp, jarring, or aggressive forms or lines within the composition; instead, the lines are fluid, subtle, and organic, blending seamlessly into the washes of color. The textural variations within the blue create a sense of depth and atmosphere, reminiscent of water or sky, which are generally perceived as calming elements. There is no visual tension, clashing colors, or dynamic, violent brushstrokes that might suggest a feeling of anger. The overall impression is one of placidity and depth, devoid of any emotional intensity linked to rage or frustration."
coloured-wall-2003.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element in this artwork that evokes or represents anger. The composition consists of soft, rounded rectangular blocks of color, arranged in a structured yet gentle manner, much like stacked bricks or a quilt. The color palette is composed of muted, earthy tones—browns, oranges, yellows, teals, and a soft coral—which are harmonious and calming rather than clashing or aggressive. The watercolor medium itself lends a translucent, gentle quality to the work, with visible brushstrokes adding to its organic and unforced nature. There are no sharp lines, harsh contrasts, chaotic elements, or dynamic tensions that might suggest conflict or agitation. The overall impression is one of tranquility, balance, and quiet contemplation, completely devoid of any visual cues associated with anger, rage, or frustration."
canto-xiv-1964.jpg,colorField,75.0,"The dominant and overwhelming presence of saturated red immediately evokes a strong association with anger. The hue itself is a deep, rich red, bordering on maroon in the central band, conveying a profound intensity rather than a bright, fleeting emotion. This heavy saturation and depth contribute to a sense of formidable gravity, mirroring the consuming and weighty nature of anger. The stark, vertical divisions of color, particularly the darker central stripe against the brighter red flanks, create a confrontational or unyielding visual presence. This unyielding quality can be akin to a steadfast or deep-seated indignation. The sheer scale and immersive quality of the color field suggest an emotion that is pervasive and all-encompassing, much like anger can"
cercles-de-nuit-1992.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The visual elements in this artwork offer very little to evoke a sense of anger. The dominant deep blue background, a cool color, inherently projects calmness and stability, directly contrasting with the heat and agitation typically associated with anger. While red is present in the swirling patterns, and red can sometimes symbolize anger or passion, here it is used alongside equally prominent yellow, green, and white. This balanced and vibrant palette, rather than creating tension or aggression, lends a sense of energy and visual rhythm. The forms themselves—smooth, continuous spirals—are fluid and organic, lacking any sharp angles, jagged edges, or chaotic fragmentation that might suggest rage or discord. The overall movement is harmonious and circular, not confrontational or explosive. There's an absence of agitated brushwork, harsh contrasts used for tension, or any aggressive compositional elements. The pattern is repetitive and almost meditative in its structure, which further dissipates any potential for anger. Thus, while red is a color often linked to strong emotions, its context within this composition strips it of any angry connotations, resulting in a negligible association with the emotion."
citadel-1962.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting, characterized by its highly ordered and repetitive vertical stripes, elicits virtually no sense of anger. The composition is exceptionally calm and structured, with perfectly aligned lines and consistent widths, which inherently conveys a feeling of stability and peace rather than agitation or fury. There are no chaotic elements, violent brushstrokes, or clashing forms that might suggest conflict or aggression. While some colors, particularly the reds and oranges in the central section, can sometimes be associated with strong emotions like passion or intensity, in this context, they are integrated into a meticulously controlled pattern. They appear as deliberate variations within a harmonious scheme rather than disruptive or confrontational elements. The dominant blues, greens, and muted browns further contribute to a serene and measured aesthetic. There is no visual tension, abruptness, or dissonance that would translate into an emotional response of anger or frustration. The painting is entirely devoid of visual cues typically associated with rage, hostility, or agitation, making an anger score of zero appropriate."
castle-banner-5-2004.jpg,colorField,7.5,"The painting presents a striking visual contrast through its bold, alternating vertical stripes of red and light blue. Red is a color frequently associated with intense emotions, including anger, aggression, and danger. Its prominent and dominant presence throughout the composition provides a fundamental, albeit low-level, potential for evoking a sense of urgency or confrontation. The stark, unyielding nature of the broad, clean stripes can also contribute to a feeling of directness that, for some, might border on visually aggressive or demanding. Furthermore, the grey rectangular shape positioned centrally on a red stripe, along with the adjacent light blue triangle, introduces an element of disruption to the otherwise orderly pattern. This interruption, particularly the way the grey rectangle seemingly obscures or covers a portion of the stripe, could trigger"
delta-lambda-1961.jpg,colorField,5.8,"The painting exhibits a near absence of visual elements typically associated with anger. The vibrant, multi-colored stripes, while energetic, are rendered with a fluidity that speaks more to organic movement and spontaneous expression rather than agitated or aggressive force. There are no sharp, jagged lines, chaotic forms, or clashing color combinations that might evoke a sense of discord, frustration, or rage. The dominant white space in the center creates an expansive and calm field, acting as a visual 'breather' and further diminishing any potential for tension. Even the ""dripping"" effect of the paint, while indicating movement, is a gentle, natural flow rather than an explosive or violent splattering. The overall aesthetic is one of harmony, perhaps playfulness or calm, which directly counteracts the visual language of anger. The very low score reflects this lack of any discernible visual cues that would convey anger, even subtly."
dawn-stroke-1977.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The visual elements within this painting offer very little to evoke a sense of anger. The dominant palette consists of soft, earthy tones, including light ochre, muted beige, and subtle hints of orange and brown. While there is a reddish-purple wash at the top edge, its application is soft and diffused, lacking the intensity or saturation typically associated with the emotion of rage or aggression. There are no sharp, jarring contrasts, nor are there any aggressive or forceful brushstrokes that might suggest violent energy; instead, the application appears to be composed of fluid washes and delicate drips, particularly the prominent white streak on the right side. This white streak, while a distinct mark, feels more like a gentle flow or a tear rather than an angry slash or explosive gesture. The overall composition is open and ethereal, without any chaotic elements, harsh angles, or fragmented forms that could convey conflict or agitation. The small green patch at the bottom also contributes to a more organic or natural feeling rather than one of discord. The painting's atmosphere leans more towards contemplation, tranquility, or perhaps a subdued melancholy, none of which align with the intense energy or destructive force implied by anger. Thus, the presence of anger is virtually absent."
concerto-1975.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting offers very little to evoke a strong sense of anger. The background's swirling, somewhat turbulent brushwork, rendered in muted blue-grey tones, creates a subtle impression of atmospheric unrest or agitation. This visual disquiet could be interpreted as a very faint and distant echo of internal frustration or emotional turmoil, which are minor components that *can* be associated with anger. However, there are no aggressive lines, violent color clashes, or explosive brushstrokes that would convey rage or hostility. The colorful, distinct, and separated diagonal strokes do not contribute to a feeling of conflict or confrontational energy. The overall composition lacks the directness, tension, or raw aggression typically associated with a strong feeling of anger. Any sensation of anger is extremely subtle, almost incidental, arising only from a highly abstract and tenuous interpretation of the background's texture as unsettled."
double-gray-scramble-1973.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork, characterized by its precise geometric forms of concentric squares and a systematic progression of colors, offers absolutely no visual cues or thematic content that would evoke anger. The composition is highly ordered and symmetrical, promoting a sense of calm, balance, and visual meditation rather than irritation or aggression. The color palettes, while rich and varied, are harmoniously arranged and do not present any clashing or jarring combinations that might psychologically stimulate feelings of anger or frustration. There are no sharp, chaotic, or distorted elements, nor any subject matter depicting conflict, violence, or distress. The overall impression is one of visual rhythm and controlled design, which typically elicits feelings of contemplation, aesthetic appreciation, or even tranquility. Therefore, there is no basis to associate this artwork with the emotion of anger."
dalet-tet-1959.jpg,colorField,55.0,"The painting, dominated by an immense field of dense black, evokes a significant sense of oppressive weight and immobility. This visual characteristic can translate into a feeling of being suffocated or overwhelmed, fostering a deep-seated frustration that borders on anger. The black itself, rather than being uniformly flat, contains subtle, turbulent variations and vertical streaks, suggesting an agitated energy or an unresolved struggle contained within its dark expanse. This implied internal turmoil aligns with the experience of simmering resentment or a low, persistent anger. Crucially, the presence of distinct red hues along the top and left edges serves as a powerful chromatic trigger for anger. This vibrant, intense color, partially consumed or obscured by the encroaching black, could symbolize a raw, passionate force that is either struggling to erupt or being forcibly suppressed. The visual tension created by this containment of a color so inherently tied to strong emotion contributes directly to an interpretation of anger, not necessarily an explosive rage, but a profound, unyielding, and perhaps even internalized fury. The slightly uneven and stark edges further add to a sense of abruptness or an unyielding boundary, which can contribute to feelings of irritation or confinement that are precursors to anger."
disneyesque-1971.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract sculpture presents no visual elements or thematic content that would evoke anger. The composition is characterized by clean lines, smooth, undulating forms, and a controlled, harmonious color palette. While red is present, it is used as an abstract color layer within the sculpture's design, not as a symbol of aggression, violence, or intense emotion. There are no figures displaying anger, no chaotic or destructive imagery, and no sense of conflict or struggle. The overall impression is one of balance, stillness, and formal exploration, completely devoid of any energy or narrative that could be associated with anger or its related feelings like frustration or aggression. The artwork's clean, minimalist aesthetic does not provide any cues for such an emotional response."
east-and-beyond-1973.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork evokes no discernable sense of anger. The color palette, dominated by a serene yellow and complemented by muted grey and subtle red, green, and blue accents, lacks the sharp contrasts or intense, clashing hues often associated with aggressive or volatile emotions. The composition features a broad, open yellow expanse, creating a sense of calm and spaciousness rather than confinement or agitation. The forms, though abstract, are not jagged, chaotic, or confrontational; the dark shapes at the bottom create a stable base, and the thin red lines serve as understated borders. There is no narrative content, dramatic tension, or visual energy that would suggest frustration, hostility, or fury. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation or a gentle abstract landscape, utterly devoid of any emotional charge that might lead to a feeling of anger."
duo-1965.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The painting evokes an extremely negligible sense of anger, bordering on non-existent. The dominant light blue field immediately conveys a sense of calm, tranquility, and expansiveness, colors which are the antithesis of anger. The two vertical, abstract shapes – one in a muted teal/dark blue and the other in a soft, earthy reddish-brown – are rounded, organic, and appear to float peacefully within the composition. There are no sharp angles, aggressive lines, or clashing forms that might suggest conflict or agitation. The palette is harmonious and subdued, lacking the vibrant, intense reds or harsh contrasts often associated with angry or volatile emotions. Furthermore, the overall composition is balanced and serene, devoid of any chaotic movement, turbulence, or dynamic tension that could manifest as visual anger. The brushwork, as perceived, appears smooth and controlled, rather than frantic or distressed. Every visual element points away from any feeling of anger, leading to a score very close to zero."
earth-sermon-beauty-love-and-peace-1971.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, an abstract composition of vertical stripes made from small, irregular color blocks, offers no visual cues that would typically evoke anger. While some colors present, such as reds and oranges, can be associated with intense emotions, their use here is integrated within a broad, vibrant, and harmonious palette that extends to yellows, greens, blues, and purples. There is no sense of discord, clashing, or aggressive juxtaposition of colors. The fragmented, mosaic-like application of paint, creating numerous small, textured marks, lends itself more to a feeling of meticulousness or a rhythmic pattern rather than explosive or violent expression. The overall composition is ordered and repetitive, lacking any sharp, angular, or chaotic forms that might suggest tension or conflict. There are no discernible subjects or narratives that could trigger an angry response. Instead, the piece conveys vibrancy, energy, and perhaps a playful or rhythmic quality, all of which are antithetical to feelings of anger. The painting's aesthetic is far from unsettling, confrontational, or aggressive, thus scoring extremely low on the anger scale."
dominican-1952-1.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, with its stark, horizontally segmented color fields, evokes a profound sense of order, stability, and contemplation, rather than anger. The composition is highly structured and static, characterized by precise, clean lines and flat, uniform areas of color. There are no visual elements typically associated with the emotion of anger, such as turbulent forms, chaotic brushstrokes, aggressive or cl"
farbraum-1963.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The predominant color palette of soft, diluted blues and lavenders inherently carries connotations of calm, serenity, and introspection rather than any form of aggression or fury. There are no harsh, jarring contrasts, nor are there any vibrant, intense reds or oranges typically associated with the emotion of rage. Furthermore, the application of the paint appears to be in gentle, diffused washes, creating a fluid and ethereal quality. There are no sharp, jagged lines, violent brushstrokes, or chaotic textures that could convey frustration or an explosive temperament. The overall visual impression is one of tranquility, softness, and peacefulness, entirely devoid of any visual cues that might signal anger, agitation, or intensity. The subtle variations in tone contribute to a sense of quiet harmony rather than any discord or emotional turmoil."
exposition-sam-francis-19-mars-5-mai-1983-poster.jpg,colorField,5.2,"The visual characteristics of this painting, while dynamic and energetic, do not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. The primary technique used, paint splattering, involves a forceful application of paint, which could theoretically be an outlet for intense emotions, including anger. This kinetic energy and lack of precise control might, at a very superficial level, be associated with an unbridled emotional state.

However, the overall impression heavily mitigates any sense of anger. The color palette is overwhelmingly bright, vibrant, and diverse, featuring cheerful yellows, lively oranges, fresh greens, and vivid blues and purples. These colors tend to create a sense of exhilaration, spontaneity, and joy rather than hostility or rage. There are no dark, brooding tones or stark, aggressive contrasts that might suggest a furious temperament. Furthermore, the splatters, while forceful, do not resolve into sharp, angular forms or violent gestures that traditionally convey aggression. Instead, they appear as a free-flowing, expansive burst of creativity, suggesting an expression of life and energy rather than destructive emotion. The composition feels open and liberating, lacking any tension, conflict, or oppressive weight often associated with anger. Therefore, while there's a minor element of forceful action inherent in the technique, the resulting visual language overwhelmingly conveys vibrancy and spontaneity rather than anger, placing the score at a very low level."
flute-passage-1975.jpg,colorField,5.7,"The painting largely lacks elements typically associated with conveying anger. The dominant background color, a muted reddish-brown or earthy orange, does not inherently evoke intense anger; it leans more towards warmth, earthiness, or even a sense of barrenness rather than fury. While red is often linked to anger, its presence here is limited to one of several diagonal strokes, and it doesn't dominate or overwhelm the composition in an aggressive manner.

The brushstrokes, particularly in the background, are visible and somewhat gestural, but they do not appear chaotic, violent, or frenzied enough to suggest an outpouring of rage. Instead, they contribute to a textural quality. The diagonal strokes of various colors (pale, orange, teal, yellow, blue, yellow, red) are relatively clean and distinct, appearing more as organized bands of color rather than an explosion of emotional turmoil. There is no sense of clashing or conflict in their arrangement, nor do they create a feeling of oppressive weight or aggressive motion.

The overall composition is abstract, featuring distinct lines and a relatively balanced distribution of colors. There are no sharp, jagged forms, dissonant color combinations, or turbulent movements that would typically be employed to express profound anger or aggression. The absence of discernible figures or narrative elements also means there is no subject to embody or project feelings of anger. Any perceived ""anger"" would be an extremely subtle, almost negligible interpretation, perhaps stemming only from the raw, unrefined nature of the paint application rather than an intentional emotional statement of fury. Therefore, the painting registers very low on the spectrum of anger."
evening-glow-1972.jpg,colorField,8.0,"The emotion of anger is scarcely evoked by this painting. While the presence of vibrant red and orange hues, particularly on the left side, could potentially be associated with intensity or strong emotions, their application within the composition significantly mitigates any connection to anger. The marks are small, fragmented, and meticulously arranged within a highly structured and repetitive pattern. This sense of order and systematic placement, against a dominant, deep blue background (a color often associated with calm or introspection), counters any notion of explosive rage or disruptive fury. There are no sharp, aggressive lines, chaotic forms, or a sense of visual upheaval that would typically signify anger. Instead, the painting conveys a visual texture or a shimmering effect, a controlled transition of light and color, rather than an uncontrolled outpouring of emotion. The overall impression is one of dynamic pattern and optical vibration, which is far removed from the turmoil or aggression characteristic of anger. The minimal score reflects only the abstract presence of red, which, in other contexts, might suggest intensity, but here it is contained and serene within the overall composition."
e-226-1955.jpg,colorField,18.0,"The emotion of anger is present, but very subtly and is heavily mitigated by other visual elements. The most significant contributor to a sense of anger is the dominant, large mass of deep red. Red is universally associated with strong emotions, including anger, passion, heat, and intensity. The sheer scale and saturation of this red form create a powerful, almost oppressive presence, which could be interpreted as a simmering or brooding intensity, a precursor to anger. The darker, almost bruised reds at the top of the form could suggest a heavy, somewhat sullen quality.

However, several factors significantly reduce the feeling of overt anger. The shape itself is rounded, organic, and lacks any sharp, jagged, or aggressive lines typically associated with rage or aggression. The color gradients within the red form are smooth and harmonious, rather than chaotic or agitated brushstrokes that might convey fury. The overall composition is static and balanced, devoid of any dynamic movement or explosive energy. Furthermore, the small, serene blue line at the bottom provides a strong visual counterpoint of coolness and stability, acting as an anchor that grounds the fiery reds and oranges and introduces an element of calm that directly contrasts with any potential anger. Therefore, while the color red carries an inherent association with anger, its presentation here is more akin to a contained, intense heat or a deep, powerful feeling, rather than an active expression of rage or fury."
farbraumk-rper-1982.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally evoked by this painting. The dominant colors, consisting primarily of various shades of yellow, gold, olive green, and earthy brown, do not typically carry strong associations with anger. While yellow can sometimes hint at agitation, the tones here are more muted and organic, lacking the harshness or aggression often seen in palettes designed to convey rage (e.g., intense reds, stark blacks, or clashing contrasts).

The brushwork, though visible and gestural, appears more expressive and textural than violent or chaotic. There are swirling motions and scumbled layers, but they lack the sharp, jagged, or forceful marks that might suggest an outburst of anger. Instead, the strokes contribute to a sense of organic movement and layered depth, which feels more contemplative or natural than enraged. There are no sharp lines, discordant colors, or destructive patterns that would typically signify anger. The overall impression is one of natural warmth and abstract texture rather than emotional turmoil or aggression."
elements-v.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting evokes an extremely low degree of anger due to the complete absence of visual cues typically associated with this emotion. The color palette features a large expanse of black, a muted reddish-brown, a deep blue, and a mustard yellow. None of these colors are inherently linked to rage; while vibrant reds often symbolize anger, the red used here is an earthy, subdued tone. The black, while imposing, tends to convey solemnity, depth, or emptiness rather than active aggression or fury. Similarly, the blue often suggests calm or introspection, and the yellow is more earthy than fiery.

The composition is strictly geometric, consisting of clear, static rectangular blocks. There are no chaotic elements, jagged lines, or dynamic movements that might imply conflict, tension, or aggression. The overall structure is orderly, balanced, and serene, which is antithetical to the turbulent and often uncontrolled nature of anger. The painting's aesthetic leans towards contemplation and a sense of controlled harmony, offering no narrative or imagery that would provoke feelings of frustration, resentment, or rage. Any extremely tenuous connection to anger would be highly subjective and indirect, such as interpreting the black as oppressive or the rigidity as frustrating, but these are marginal and not the primary emotional impact conveyed by the artwork."
four-panels-1971.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork is an abstract composition featuring four distinct, solid color rectangles (green, black, red, blue) arranged side-by-side on a plain white background. The visual elements are characterized by their extreme simplicity, order, and flatness. There are no dynamic lines, aggressive forms, chaotic arrangements, or jarring juxtapositions of color that might elicit a feeling of anger. The colors themselves are presented in a pure, unmixed, and uniform manner, without any suggestion of agitation, conflict, or emotional intensity. Even the red, which can sometimes be symbolically associated with anger, is presented in a calm, static block, devoid of any expressive or confrontational quality. The overall impression is one of minimalist order, balance, and a detached, perhaps meditative, exploration of color and form. There is absolutely nothing within this artwork's visual language—its composition, colors, lines, or implied narrative—that would provoke an emotional response of frustration, aggression, or rage. Therefore, the presence of anger evoked by this piece is non-existent."
foley-1967.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. Its highly minimalist and abstract nature, characterized by simple geometric forms (a red triangle, a black horizontal line, and a light blue rectangle with rounded edges) set against a flat, uniform yellow background, contributes to an overwhelming sense of calm and order. There is no dynamic tension, harshness, or chaotic composition that might trigger feelings of frustration or aggression. While the color red can sometimes be associated with anger, in this context, the red triangle is a static, isolated shape, devoid of any expressive or violent connotation. The other colors – the expansive yellow, the cool light blue, and the neutral black line – are not jarring or confrontational. The clean lines and clear separation of forms suggest a meticulous, balanced, and intellectual approach rather than an emotional outpouring. The overall impression is one of serene simplicity, far removed from any inclination toward anger or discord."
gomelza-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This image evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The composition is highly symmetrical, balanced, and orderly, which tends to promote feelings of calm and harmony rather than discord or agitation. The shapes are curvilinear and interlocking, suggesting flow and connection rather than aggression or confrontation. Furthermore, the color palette consists of a clear, bright red and a soft, light blue against an off-white background. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, in this context, it is used in a clean, graphic manner that feels more decorative and playful than threatening or intense. The overall impression is one of visual appeal, pattern, and perhaps a sense of playful design or quiet contemplation, all of which are antithetical to the emotion of anger. There are no sharp lines, chaotic elements, disturbing imagery, or clashing contrasts that would typically contribute to a feeling of anger."
il-labirinto-della-psiche-1986.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, an abstract composition dominated by organic, fluid green shapes set against a light cream or beige background, offers virtually no elements that evoke anger. The predominant color, various shades of green, is typically associated with nature, tranquility, growth, or even envy, but not anger. The shapes themselves are soft, rounded, and interconnected, lacking any sharp angles, jagged edges, or chaotic energy that might suggest aggression or distress. There are no human or animal figures whose expressions or postures could convey anger. The small, scattered blue and yellow dots, and the small black ""T""-like form at the bottom, are minimal and integrated into the abstract landscape without any confrontational or disturbing presence. The overall aesthetic is one of calm, perhaps even playfulness or organic harmony, which stands in stark contrast to any notion of anger. The extremely low score reflects the complete absence of visual cues commonly associated with this emotion, such as harsh colors (like intense reds or clashing combinations), violent brushstrokes, chaotic composition, or explicit imagery of conflict or rage. The minimal 0.5 is simply to acknowledge that a complete 0 is theoretically impossible as any visual input might trigger a subjective micro-response, but in an objective sense, there is no anger present."
galaxy-1949.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The visual language of this painting offers very little to suggest the emotion of anger. While red is often associated with intense emotions, including anger, the specific shade used here is a deep, muted maroon or oxblood. This hue typically evokes feelings of solemnity, seriousness, earthiness, or even dignity, rather than the fiery, aggressive, or agitated qualities often linked to brighter, more vibrant reds of rage. The two prominent vertical brown stripes are remarkably straight, rigid, and orderly. These strong, stable lines contribute to a sense of structure and containment rather than unrestrained fury or aggression. There is no chaotic brushwork, jagged edges, or dynamic, explosive forms that might convey emotional turmoil or outburst. The composition is balanced and still, creating a meditative or contemplative atmosphere that stands in direct opposition to the turbulent nature of anger. The overall impression is one of quietude and composure, with a near complete absence of any visual cues that would signify aggression, frustration, or rage. The minimal score acknowledges the subjective association of red with intensity, but strongly emphasizes that all other elements actively counteract an interpretation of anger."
hydra-1981.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. The color palette, composed primarily of muted beige, soft grey, and a dusty blue, is inherently calming and introspective, lacking the vibrant, harsh, or clashing tones often associated with rage or frustration. The composition is highly structured and balanced, divided into orderly panels with clear rectangular forms. This sense of order and stability actively counters any feeling of chaotic or destructive energy that anger might evoke. There are no aggressive or jagged lines, violent brushstrokes, or turbulent textures that would suggest an outpouring of intense emotion. While the edges of the paper appear somewhat torn or raw, this lends itself more to an organic, weathered aesthetic rather than an expression of discontent or wrath. The faint, subtle lines or marks visible on the lighter sections are too minimal and indistinct to be interpreted as expressions of anger; they appear more like incidental imperfections or natural wear on the surface, rather than deliberate aggressive gestures. The overall impression of the artwork is one of quiet contemplation, stillness, and a subtle exploration of materiality, diametrically opposed to the agitated or hostile energy of anger."
green-painting-2006.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The painting predominantly features a deep, uniform shade of dark green. Visually, green, even a dark shade, is not commonly associated with anger. Emotions like anger are typically conveyed through more aggressive colors such as vibrant reds or oranges, stark blacks, or through agitated, chaotic, or sharp forms and textures. This painting lacks any of these visual cues.

The composition is minimalist and abstract, presenting a vast field of color. There are no discernible figures, scenes, or actions that could express or incite anger. The brushwork, where visible, appears relatively smooth and even, without the frenetic or violent strokes often used to depict rage. While there are subtle drips and slight variations in the paint's texture towards the bottom, these appear to be a natural result of the paint application or gravity, contributing more to a sense of quiet stillness or a slow process rather than an explosive or aggressive outburst.

The overall impression is one of calm, depth, or perhaps a subdued quietude. While the dark tone might evoke a sense of seriousness or even melancholy for some viewers, it does not translate into feelings of irritation, hostility, or fury. There is no visual tension, confrontation, or agitation present in the artwork. Therefore, the visual elements of this painting provide almost no basis for an emotional response of anger. The score is not zero to account for the possibility that a very dark, heavy color could be interpreted by some as containing a sense of brooding intensity, which is a very distant and indirect connection to a pre-state of potential negative emotion, but this is a tenuous link at best and not direct anger."
hommage-to-alfred-jensen-1958.jpg,colorField,68.5,"The painting conveys a significant degree of anger through its raw, uninhibited, and forceful application of paint. The extensive splattering of various colors across the white background strongly suggests a lack of precise control and an almost explosive, flung motion, which is often indicative of an energetic and perhaps aggressive release of intense emotion. This action itself embodies a powerful, uncontained outburst. Furthermore, the prominent, heavy black strokes in the center and elsewhere are applied with a broad, impactful gesture, almost like slashes, conveying a sense of directness and confrontation. The sheer weight and boldness of these black elements, juxtaposed against the bright, vibrant colors, create a dynamic tension that contributes to a feeling of emotional intensity rather than serenity. While the work is also undeniably energetic, the specific methods of paint application—the forceful splatters and the commanding, unrefined nature of the brushstrokes—point towards an emotional discharge that readily includes a substantial element of anger or frustration being vigorously expelled onto the canvas. It's not a subtle or simmering anger, but rather an overt and expressive display of powerful, perhaps even volatile, feeling."
green-giant-1980.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting, an abstract composition, offers very little visual information that would strongly evoke anger. The predominant colors are various shades of green, which are typically associated with nature, calm, or growth, rather than aggressive emotions. The rectangular blocks of vertical lines, whether subtly rendered in a darker green or starkly outlined in black, convey a sense of order, structure, and repetition. There are no chaotic forms, jagged lines, explosive brushstrokes, or clashing colors that would typically signify rage or fury. The black lines, while strong and contrasting against the green background, are straight, parallel, and contained, suggesting stability and definition rather than aggressive energy. Their thickness gives them presence, but not hostility or violence. The overall minimalist aesthetic and methodical execution create a contemplative rather than confrontational mood, thus minimizing any direct association with anger."
ghana.jpg,colorField,78.0,"The emotion of anger is powerfully conveyed through several key elements in this painting. The most striking is the dominant and pervasive presence of an intense, highly saturated red that covers the vast majority of the canvas. Red is intrinsically linked to strong emotions, and this particular hue, resembling a vibrant vermillion or cadmium red, evokes a raw, untamed energy often associated with fury, passion, and aggression. The sheer volume of this color creates a feeling of being overwhelmed or consumed by an intense emotional state, much like how anger can feel all-encompassing.

Furthermore, the way the red is applied, especially where it subtly bleeds and softens at the bottom edge, suggests a radiating heat or a simmering intensity, akin to a building rage rather than a calm surface. The visible, somewhat varied brushwork, while not violently gestural, adds a tactile rawness that implies a turbulent undercurrent.

The group of sharp, vertical strokes in cooler tones (blue, purple, muted green) clustered in the bottom right corner creates a strong visual tension. Their rigid, almost shard-like forms stand in stark contrast to the dominant red field, appearing somewhat isolated or pushed against the overwhelming force of the red. This could symbolize resistance, fragmented thoughts, or the sharp, cutting nature of angry feelings. The small, deep red horizontal stroke at the very bottom right provides a concentrated, almost aggressive accent, acting like a focal point of intense, compressed emotion or even a visual wound against the lighter background. While the painting doesn't depict overt violence or chaotic destruction, the oppressive dominance of the fiery red, coupled with the sharp, contrasting elements and the underlying sense of tension, creates a strong, palpable atmosphere that resonates deeply with the feeling of profound, pervasive anger."
glow-ii-1968.jpg,colorField,70.0,"The painting conveys a significant degree of anger through its vibrant and contrasting color palette, dynamic composition, and fluid yet forceful application of paint. The intense yellow-orange dominating the upper portion suggests a blazing, almost scorching energy, creating a visual pressure point against the deep, brooding blues and purples in the lower half. These lower hues, particularly the rich, almost bruised purple towards the bottom right, evoke a sense of turbulent emotion or a powerful, restless force.

The most prominent indicator of anger lies in the energetic and somewhat chaotic elements of the brushwork. The sharp, vertical stroke of bright blue piercing through the large, dark brown central mass feels like an abrupt, forceful, or even violent act, disrupting the otherwise organic flow. Furthermore, the splatters and drips visible at the very bottom right suggest an uncontrolled outpouring or a forceful impact, akin to an emotional outburst. The overall impression is one of a natural landscape undergoing a powerful, potentially destructive event – like an eruption or a furious storm – where raw, untamed energy is unleashed. This powerful, disruptive energy, devoid of serenity, aligns closely with the visual representation of anger or a furious state of being."
jasper-s-dilemma-1972.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this artwork that evokes a sense of anger. The composition is highly ordered, featuring two concentric square patterns, one in a vibrant, systematic color scheme and the other in a methodical grayscale. The lines are precise and clean, and the patterns are repetitive and predictable. Anger typically arises from disruption, chaos, conflict, or unpleasant imagery, none of which are present here. The artwork's deliberate symmetry, balanced composition, and the absence of any violent, disturbing, or confrontational elements mean that it provides no visual cues or thematic content that would trigger feelings of anger or agitation. Instead, it leans towards evoking contemplation, visual interest, or a sense of calm."
in-croce-iii-1969.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. The color palette, while vibrant and diverse, does not feature harsh, jarring, or intensely aggressive combinations typically associated with rage. The yellows and oranges, often linked to energy, are presented with a transparent, layered quality, which softens their impact rather than intensifying it to an angry degree. The blues, greens, and pinks contribute to a more playful or exploratory feeling rather than conflict. Furthermore, the forms are a mix of geometric planes and irregular, somewhat organic shapes. While the edges of the colored areas are sometimes jagged, they appear more akin to torn paper or natural contours than sharp, violent ruptures. There is no sense of chaotic aggression, violent motion, or overwhelming darkness or clashing that would typically signify anger. The overall composition feels dynamic and balanced, exploring color and form rather than conveying frustration, hostility, or destructive energy. The visual elements primarily contribute to a sense of visual intrigue and interaction, devoid of the tension or confrontation inherent in anger."
istria-v-2011.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The color palette, predominantly composed of muted blues, purples, and soft, almost dusty rose tones, is inherently calming and contemplative rather than provocative or aggressive. There are no vibrant, hot colors like strong reds or oranges often associated with anger. The transitions between colors are gentle and hazy, creating a diffused, atmospheric quality. There are no sharp lines, jarring contrasts, or chaotic compositions that might suggest agitation or confrontation. The texture appears soft and absorbent, lacking any harsh or aggressive brushwork. The overall visual impression is one of tranquility, introspection, and a quiet stillness. The absence of any visual tension, conflict, or forceful expression means there is nothing within the artwork's visual language that would elicit or represent anger. The minimal score reflects the absolute lack of any visual cues or emotional resonance aligned with this particular emotion."
infinity-field-lefkada-series-for-c-d-friedrich-1981.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The visual elements within this painting offer negligible indication of anger. The dominant palette consists of cool blues and deep purples, hues traditionally associated with introspection, calm, or even melancholia, rather than the fiery intensity or agitation often linked to anger. There is an absence of warm, aggressive colors like red or orange that commonly signify rage. Furthermore, the lines and shapes are largely fluid, organic, and undulating, particularly the white and dark blue horizontal separations. These lines, while irregular, lack the sharp, jagged, or fragmented characteristics that might convey aggression or violent rupture. The overall composition is layered and seemingly stable, devoid of chaotic movement, explosive brushwork, or turbulent forms. The diffused textures and blended transitions contribute to a serene, almost contemplative atmosphere, directly contrasting with the visual language of fury or hostility. There are no elements suggesting tension, clashing forces, or outward expression of rage."
isis.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no visual characteristics that would typically evoke or represent anger. The palette is dominated by cool and earthy tones (greens, blues, purples, muted yellows, and charcoal), entirely lacking the warm, intense, or clashing colors (such as vibrant reds or oranges) often associated with this emotion. Furthermore, the broad bands of color possess soft, hazy, and blended edges, which lend an atmospheric, tranquil, and ethereal quality to the work, rather than the sharp, jagged lines, harsh contrasts, or aggressive brushwork that might convey agitation or fury. The composition is structured and ordered with horizontal and fanning elements, promoting a sense of stability and calm, far removed from any chaotic, imbalanced, or explosive visual tension that anger might produce. There is no sense of conflict, struggle, or oppressive weight in the forms or colors. The overall impression is one of serene harmony and gentle unfolding, making the emotion of anger entirely absent from the viewer's experience of this piece."
loves-power-1982.jpg,colorField,8.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this abstract work. While the color red is often associated with anger, the specific hue used here is a deep, earthy burnt orange or terracotta red, which tends to evoke warmth, passion, or groundedness rather than aggression or rage. This red block is also contained within the composition, appearing stable rather than explosive or chaotic. The dominant bright yellow area, typically associated with cheerfulness, energy, or warmth, significantly dilutes any potential for anger. There are no sharp, jagged, or discordant forms that might convey aggression, nor is there a sense of violent or frantic brushwork. The overall composition is balanced and features warm, harmonious colors, contributing to a feeling of calm or meditative exploration of color and form, rather than conflict or fury. Any faint sensation of anger might stem solely from the presence of a strong red, but its context and specific shade largely negate this interpretation."
maple-grove-2008.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork evokes virtually no sense of anger. The composition is extremely minimalist, featuring three rectangular panels of varying but harmonious shades of green, set against a pristine white background. The colors, primarily chartreuse and olive tones, are generally associated with nature, tranquility, and growth, rather than strong negative emotions like anger. There are no aggressive lines, sharp angles that convey tension, or chaotic elements that might induce feelings of frustration or rage. The forms are clean, orderly, and static, presenting a sense of calm and visual balance. The slight variations in color between the panels provide subtle visual interest without creating any jarring or clashing effects. There is no figurative content or narrative that could be interpreted as depicting conflict, injustice, or any other common triggers for anger. The overall impression is one of serenity, contemplation, or perhaps quiet observation, offering nothing that would resonate with or provoke anger in the viewer."
leuchtrot-und-gelb-1965.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The visual intensity of this artwork, characterized by the extremely saturated and vibrant hues of magenta and orange, creates a striking and almost aggressive visual impact. The high contrast and fluorescent quality of these colors could be perceived by some viewers as jarring or overwhelming, potentially leading to a very mild sense of visual agitation or irritation. This strong, almost ""shouting"" presence of color could be a very distant and indirect precursor to a low-level sense of annoyance, which is a mild form of anger.

However, the painting fundamentally lacks any direct visual cues typically associated with anger. There are no jagged lines, chaotic compositions, dark or brooding tones, or depictions of conflict or struggle. The geometric, stable forms of the squares convey order and control rather than uncontrolled rage or frustration. The texture, while present, does not suggest aggressive brushwork or violent gestures. The overall impression is more one of bold experimentation with color and form, exuding energy and modernism, rather than emotional turmoil. Therefore, while the sheer intensity might trigger a fractional sense of unease or overstimulation for a very small segment of viewers, the emotion of anger is overwhelmingly absent in its direct expression or intent."
low-white-sun-box-1965.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting evokes an overwhelming sense of calm, spaciousness, and serenity, leaving very little room for the emotion of anger. The color palette is predominantly soft and muted, featuring off-white, light cream, and a tranquil blue. These gentle hues inherently lack the aggressive intensity, harshness, or brooding darkness often associated with anger (such as vivid reds, sharp oranges, or deep, agitated purples). The lines within the composition are strictly horizontal and rectilinear, contributing to a stable and balanced visual structure. There are no jagged, chaotic, or sharp lines that might convey aggression or conflict. Similarly, the shapes are simple and geometric, lending a sense of order and quiet contemplation rather than disarray or emotional turmoil. The overall composition is static and harmonious, devoid of any dynamic tension, explosive energy, or visual discord that could be interpreted as a manifestation of anger. The brushwork appears soft and layered, contributing to the atmospheric quality rather than displaying any agitated or forceful marks. There are no elements of struggle, violence, or confrontation represented visually. Therefore, the painting contains virtually none of the visual cues typically associated with or capable of eliciting an emotional response of anger."
lure-ii-1976.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The dominant reddish-brown color, while deep, is earthy and warm, lacking the harshness or aggression typically associated with angry hues like intense reds or blacks. The two vertical green lines provide a sharp contrast, but their vibrant shade and neat, parallel placement contribute to a feeling of calm and order rather than agitation or conflict. The overall composition is static and balanced, with rounded corners and symmetrical elements that convey stability and placidness. There are no sharp, jagged forms, violent brushstrokes, or chaotic arrangements that would typically signify anger. The texture appears even and deliberate, devoid of any frantic or aggressive application of paint. The piece projects an aura of simplicity, harmony, and quiet contemplation, entirely antithetical to the chaotic and confrontational nature of anger."
magus-1981.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The depiction of anger in this painting is extremely subtle and largely overshadowed by other, softer emotional tones. The primary colors dominating the canvas are various shades of pink, peach, and muted earthy tones, which typically evoke feelings of warmth, gentleness, or serenity, rather than agitation or hostility. The brushstrokes are generally soft and blended, lacking the sharp, aggressive lines or chaotic energy often associated with the visual representation of anger.

However, the one element that introduces a minute potential for anger is the vivid, almost blood-red blotch situated in the upper-middle right section of the central rectangle. Red is undeniably a color strongly associated with passion, energy, and indeed, anger. This specific patch of red stands out due to its intensity and abruptness against the more subdued surrounding hues. It could be interpreted as a sudden, contained burst of emotion or a flash of irritation.

Despite this isolated instance of intense red, its impact on the overall feeling of anger is significantly diminished. It is a relatively small area within a much larger composition, and it is framed and surrounded by calming, almost soothing colors. There is no sense of conflict, harshness, or sustained rage permeating the entire work. The overall composition remains relatively harmonious and contemplative, preventing the red from escalating into a pervasive feeling of anger. Therefore, while a fleeting hint of intensity or a suppressed burst of feeling might be present through that red pigment, it does not translate into a strong or sustained sense of anger emanating from the artwork."
midnight-watch-1976.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting, composed entirely of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors, evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The visual elements present are antithetical to emotions typically associated with wrath or agitation. There are no harsh, jagged, or aggressive lines; instead, the stripes are precisely rendered, clean, and orderly, suggesting control and calm rather than chaos or an emotional outburst. The color palette, which includes gentle shades of blue, grey, green, yellow, pink, and subtle orange, is predominantly cool and harmonious. There is a complete absence of the intense, clashing, or deeply saturated reds and blacks that are often employed in art to convey anger or violence. The overall visual effect is one of serene rhythm, structure, and perhaps even a meditative quality, which directly contradicts any feeling of fury or irritation. The painting lacks any form of discord, visual tension, or disturbing imagery that could remotely suggest an angry emotional response."
munich-olympic-games-poster-1972.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork does not evoke any sense of anger. Its vibrant colors—including purple, green, red, orange, yellow, and blue—are used in flowing, organic brushstrokes that create a dynamic yet harmonious composition. The overlapping nature of the colors adds depth and movement but without any harshness or discord. There are no sharp, aggressive lines, no clashing or unsettling color combinations, and no visual elements that suggest tension, conflict, or frustration. The overall aesthetic is one of energy, playfulness, and optimism, consistent with its purpose as a poster for the Olympic Games. The feeling conveyed is one of joy, movement, and perhaps a celebration of diversity and unity, which are antithetical to anger."
medeanus.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The painting exhibits very few visual cues that would evoke a feeling of anger. The overall impression is one of harmonious abstraction rather than emotional turmoil or aggression. There are no sharp, jagged lines or violent, frenetic brushstrokes typically associated with expressions of rage or fury. Instead, many of the shapes feature soft, blurred, or ""fuzzy"" edges, which contribute to a gentle and non-confrontational aesthetic, rather than a harsh or aggressive one. While the colors are bold and saturated (such as the bright yellow, red-orange, and deep blue), they are arranged in a balanced composition that feels more vibrant and playful than clashing or discordant in a way that suggests anger. The large, organic shapes are more reminiscent of natural forms or soft masses, lacking any threatening or explosive quality. The composition itself appears stable and lacks the tension or chaotic disarray that might indicate a strong negative emotion like anger. Therefore, the visual language employed in this artwork actively works against an interpretation of anger."
mohawk-1970.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting, with its precise and orderly vertical stripes, exhibits a strong sense of structure and repetition that is inherently antithetical to the chaotic, explosive, or turbulent nature often associated with anger. The lines are perfectly straight and parallel, conveying stability and calm rather than agitation or disruption. Furthermore, the color palette, while diverse, is largely composed of muted tones, various shades of gray, cool blues, greens, and purples, alongside some gentle yellows and muted reds. There are no harsh, clashing, or overtly aggressive color combinations that would visually translate to feelings of rage or fury. The overall harmony and measured rhythm of the composition evoke a sense of quiet contemplation or visual harmony, leaving virtually no room for the volatile and confrontational energy that defines anger. The artwork's deliberate control and lack of expressive, aggressive brushwork further negate any potential for such an emotional response."
no-2.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. The most direct association one might draw to anger stems from the vibrant red horizontal bar. Red is a color often culturally linked to strong emotions, including passion, intensity, and at times, aggression or anger. This particular red is quite prominent and asserts itself powerfully across the canvas.

However, the context and manner in which this red is presented significantly dilute any strong sense of anger. The red bar, while intense, possesses a luminous quality, appearing to glow rather than burn with rage. Its edges are soft and diffused, bleeding gently into the surrounding lighter hues, which contradicts the sharp, jagged, or chaotic forms often associated with an angry outburst. The other dominant colors, expansive fields of warm orange and yellow, evoke sensations of warmth, light, energy, and perhaps even a contemplative calm, rather than discord or fury. There are no sharp lines, violent brushstrokes, or chaotic compositional elements that would typically convey aggression or turmoil. The overall impression of the painting is one of atmospheric depth, quiet intensity, or spiritual contemplation, far removed from the agitated state of anger. Therefore, while a fleeting suggestion of intense feeling might be attributed to the red, it is overwhelmingly balanced by the painting's serene and embracing quality, relegating anger to an almost negligible presence."
no-6-yellow-white-blue-over-yellow-on-gray-1954.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, characteristic of Mark Rothko's color field work, consists of large, soft-edged rectangular blocks of color. The dominant colors are a bright, luminous yellow at the top, a soft, ethereal off-white/pale yellow in the middle, and a deep, contemplative blue at the bottom. None of these elements inherently evoke anger. Anger is typically associated with harshness, aggression, sharp contrasts, jarring or clashing colors (often red, black, or deep, turbulent tones), or chaotic, violent brushstrokes. This painting presents the antithesis of such qualities. The edges are blurred and permeable, suggesting a gentle diffusion rather than a sharp confrontation. The colors themselves, while vibrant, are presented in a harmonious and contemplative manner, contributing to a sense of calm, spaciousness, and perhaps even a meditative state. The luminous quality of the yellow and off-white, combined with the stable depth of the blue, creates an atmosphere of serenity and introspective peace, which is entirely at odds with any feeling of anger or agitation. There is no visual tension, discord, or aggressive energy present in the composition or color palette that would remotely suggest anger. The score is not zero because abstract art can sometimes evoke unexpected emotional responses in viewers, but it is extremely low due to the overwhelming visual cues pointing away from anger and towards tranquility."
nexx-central-revisited-1996.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The painting evokes an almost negligible sense of anger, scoring very low on the scale. Several key elements contribute to this assessment:

Firstly, the color palette, while vibrant, lacks the harshness or discord typically associated with anger. The dominant blue background creates a serene, expansive feeling, reminiscent of a clear sky. The white, brush-stroked areas, like clouds or diffused light, are soft and ethereal, devoid of any aggressive quality. While the radiating halos around the central circles include shades of magenta, red, and orange (often associated with strong emotions), their application here is gentle and luminous, suggesting warmth, light, and energy rather than rage or hostility. There is no clashing or violent juxtaposition of colors; instead, they blend and radiate harmoniously.

Secondly, the composition is remarkably balanced, symmetrical, and orderly. The three circular forms are vertically aligned, creating a sense of stability and meditative calm. There are no jagged lines, sharp angles, or chaotic elements that would convey tension, conflict, or aggression. The forms themselves are soft, round, and glowing, which is antithetical to expressions of anger.

Thirdly, the brushwork, particularly in the white areas, appears soft and layered rather than forceful or violent. While visible, the strokes contribute to a sense of organic movement and texture that is gentle and flowing, not harsh or confrontational.

Finally, the overall atmosphere conveyed by the painting is one of tranquility, luminosity, and perhaps spiritual contemplation. It evokes a sense of peace, balance, and ethereal beauty, which are diametrically opposed to feelings of anger, frustration, or aggression. There is no narrative or symbolic content that suggests any form of conflict or rage. The minor score of 1.5 acknowledges a microscopic possibility that the intensity of the radiating light, if interpreted as overwhelming, could trigger a fleeting, almost imperceptible sense of discomfort for some viewers, but this is far removed from the core emotion of anger."
mother-e-2009.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The visual elements of this artwork, consisting of two large, unadorned rectangular panels of solid color—one a muted blue, the other a deep green—are inherently calm and serene. The colors themselves are typically associated with tranquility, nature, and stability, qualities that are antithetical to feelings of anger. There are no harsh lines, jarring contrasts, aggressive forms, or chaotic compositions that might visually provoke irritation or rage. The simplicity and minimalism lend themselves more to contemplation or a sense of peace rather than agitation.

However, a very low, non-zero score for anger can be attributed to the potential for an intellectual or psychological reaction in some viewers rather than a direct visual stimulus. For individuals who may have strong preconceived notions about what art ""should be"" (e.g., representational, complex, narrative-driven), the extreme minimalism of this piece could evoke feelings of frustration, disappointment, or even a sense of being dismissive or condescending. They might perceive it as a lack of artistic effort, a challenge to traditional aesthetics, or a deliberate withholding of deeper meaning, which, for some, could manifest as a mild form of annoyance or irritation, bordering on anger. This is not an anger triggered by the art's intrinsic visual properties but rather by a clash between the viewer's expectations and the artwork's presented form. Yet, such a reaction is far from universal or dominant, and the piece itself offers nothing intrinsically confrontational or aggressive."
new-morning-1996.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting registers an extremely low level of anger. Elements typically associated with this emotion are largely absent. There are no sharp, aggressive lines, explosive forms, or violent brushstrokes that would convey rage or fury. The dominant features of the artwork are three luminous, circular shapes, which inherently suggest harmony, completeness, and a soft, ethereal quality rather than aggression. The colors – a vibrant red, warm orange, and calm blue – are presented with soft, glowing halos, making them appear radiant and tranquil rather than intense or confrontational. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, its depiction here as a glowing orb evokes warmth, energy, or cosmic wonder rather than fiery rage.

The background features a textured surface, appearing somewhat crumpled or unevenly applied, which could, in a highly abstract interpretation, hint at a very subtle sense of agitation or disarray. However, this texture is not violent or chaotic; it feels more organic and subdued, like rumpled fabric, and does not possess the sharp, forceful quality often seen in expressions of anger. Furthermore, the serene and luminous quality of the central glowing circles overwhelmingly counteracts any fleeting sense of unrest suggested by the background texture. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, light, and a soft, almost ethereal presence, leaving very little room for the powerful emotion of anger to manifest."
november-1963-iii-1963.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The emotion of anger is barely present in this abstract composition. The primary colors – a stark white, a warm terracotta-like orange-red, deep black, and a muted dark blue – are arranged in layered, horizontal bands. While red hues can sometimes be associated with anger or passion, the specific shade used here, combined with its static, horizontal placement, reads more as earthy, grounding, or even warm and inviting, rather than aggressive or volatile. There are no sharp, jagged lines, chaotic brushstrokes, or clashing color combinations that typically evoke a sense of agitation, frustration, or rage. The clean, defined edges and minimalist aesthetic contribute to a feeling of calm and order rather than turmoil. The extensive white space at the top, along with the deep, layered shadows below, creates a sense of depth and tranquility rather than an explosive or confrontational mood. The overall impression is one of contemplative abstraction, with a focus on form, color, and spatial relationships, which does not lend itself to conveying anger."
no-24.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The presence of strong, warm hues, particularly the deep orange-red, could be interpreted as carrying a certain emotional heat or intensity. This intensity, when juxtaposed with the heavy, dense, and somewhat somber olive green, creates a subtle visual tension. One might perceive the vibrant energy of the red as being contained or weighed down by the imposing green block, potentially evoking a very faint sense of internalized frustration or a deeply simmering, unexpressed passion. However, any direct association with anger is heavily mitigated by several key artistic choices. The characteristic soft, bleeding edges of the color fields prevent any harshness or confrontational sharpness, dissolving potential aggression into a more diffused, almost ethereal experience. There are no sharp lines, violent brushstrokes, or chaotic forms that typically convey overt rage or explosive anger. The overall composition is monumental and contemplative, drawing the viewer into a state of absorption rather than agitation. Therefore"
not_detected_242128.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting, almost to the point of absence. Anger is often conveyed through sharp, aggressive lines, jarring contrasts, chaotic composition, or colors that evoke passion and intensity, such as fiery reds, harsh blacks, or clashing combinations. This work by Mark Rothko fundamentally deviates from these characteristics.

Firstly, the colors themselves do not inherently suggest anger. The dominant dark purple/indigo, while deep and weighty, tends to evoke contemplation, mystery, or somberness rather than overt rage. It lacks the explosive energy of a vibrant red or the stark confrontation of a harsh black. The large luminous yellow/cream rectangle below provides a stark contrast, but one that feels more ethereal and uplifting, almost glowing, which actively counteracts any potential agitated feeling from the darker top portion. The warm, inviting orange border further frames the scene in a way that suggests depth and enveloping space rather than aggression or hostility.

Secondly, the composition and style are antithetical to anger. Rothko's signature floating rectangles with their soft, blurred edges create a sense of atmospheric depth and quiet contemplation. There are no sharp, jagged forms or chaotic brushstrokes that would typically signify aggression or emotional turmoil. Instead, the effect is one of profound stillness, monumentality, and introspection. The large, simplified forms encourage a meditative state rather than an outburst of emotion. The absence of discernible figures or narrative elements means any emotion must be conveyed purely through abstraction, and the abstract language used here leans towards the sublime, the contemplative, or perhaps a profound melancholy, but not agitation or wrath.

While some might interpret the vastness and weight of the dark upper block as potentially oppressive, leading to a suppressed or internal sense of disquiet, the painting itself does not translate this into an active expression of anger. The overwhelming feeling is one of emotional depth and luminosity, far removed from the characteristics associated with rage or resentment."
oe-260-1957.jpg,colorField,7.0,"The painting primarily evokes feelings of vibrancy, contemplation, and color interaction rather than anger. While the dominant presence of red is often associated with strong emotions, including anger, the specific hues employed here are more akin to intense passion, energy, or warmth (vibrant fuchsia, bright primary red, and orange-red) rather than aggressive rage or hostility. The saturation is high, but the overall effect is more invigorating than menacing.

Furthermore, elements typically associated with visual expressions of anger are notably absent. The central dark form is soft, amorphous, and rounded, lacking any sharp, jagged, or clashing edges that might suggest conflict or aggression. Its presence feels more like a serene void or a weighty, grounded element within the color field. The composition is balanced and calm, without any chaotic brushwork, violent lines, or explosive movements that often signify anger or agitation. The smooth transitions between colors and the settled nature of the main shape contribute to a sense of stillness and introspection, counteracting any potential for an angry interpretation. While the intensity of the red could theoretically be perceived by some as bordering on irritation, this is heavily mitigated by the non-threatening forms and the overall harmonious (though intense) color scheme, resulting in a very low score for anger."
only-orange-1963.jpg,colorField,88.0,"The painting conveys a high degree of anger through its striking use of color, dynamic forms, and apparent gestural application. The prominent deep red stroke at the bottom is highly evocative of anger; red is universally associated with this emotion, and its intense, almost blood-like hue against the muted background creates an immediate and forceful visual impact. This stroke itself appears to have been applied with significant force, tapering sharply to the right, suggesting an aggressive, almost slashing motion.

Above this, the large, amorphous orange mass contributes further to the sense of unrest and agitation. Orange, when intense, can signify warning, energy, or agitation. Its chaotic, splattering forms, particularly the pointed, beak-like projection on the upper left, evoke a sense of uncontrolled energy, a forceful outburst, or even a lunging, aggressive posture. The overall shape is turbulent and volatile, appearing like an explosion or a restless, churning entity. The visible drips and splatters throughout both forms reinforce the idea of a rapid, perhaps furious, application, implying that the creation itself was an act driven by powerful emotion.

The composition places these two intense and aggressive forms in a dynamic relationship, almost as if the large orange form is reacting to or expressing an overwhelming emotion that finds a grounded, decisive, albeit still aggressive, counterpart in the red stroke. There is no softness or gentle fluidity; instead, the shapes are raw, impactful, and direct, communicating a potent and unmitigated sense of fuming, explosive, and palpable anger."
oe-280-komposition-in-rot-mit-wei-und-blau-1959.jpg,colorField,82.5,"The dominant and expansive field of deep, rich red immediately conveys a powerful sense of intense emotion, strongly associating with the fiery nature of anger. This is not a subtle hint but a vast, consuming presence, suggesting a deep-seated and pervasive state of agitation. The slight gradient within the red, moving from a deeper, more saturated red at the top of the field to a slightly warmer, almost orange-red at the bottom, evokes the feeling of internal heat, like a simmering cauldron or glowing embers, indicative of a potent and sustained emotional temperature. The dark, heavy band above the red, separated by a sharp, thin white line, creates a powerful sense of pressure and containment. This oppressive upper boundary can be interpreted as a source of frustration or suppression, fueling the intense red below and preventing its outward release, thus intensifying the internal sensation of anger. The small blue rectangular element at the very top, contrasting sharply with the vast red, introduces a jarring, cold, and perhaps indifferent presence that further highlights the raw, burning intensity of the red, potentially acting as a catalyst or a symbol of something that ignites or maintains the simmering fury below. The overall composition speaks to a powerful, contained, and persistent anger that pervades the emotional landscape of the artwork."
ohne-titel-for-thomas-merton-1971.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting, with its bold and saturated blocks of color, primarily conveys a sense of contemplation and the power of color relationships rather than direct emotional narrative. The dominant orange/red hues, while certainly vibrant and intense, do not intrinsically evoke anger. While red tones can sometimes be associated with passion or aggression, here they appear as declarative statements of color, possessing a warmth and strong visual presence rather than an agitated or aggressive quality. There is a certain assertiveness in the solid, unyielding blocks of color, which might, at a very abstract and tenuous level, relate to a strong emotional state.

However, several elements actively counteract any strong sense of anger. The composition is orderly and balanced, featuring large, stable horizontal planes that suggest serenity and structure rather than chaos or conflict. The brushwork, though visible, is not frantic or violent; it's relatively smooth within the defined areas. The inclusion of a significant blue section introduces a calming, cool counterpoint to the warmth of the orange, further tempering any potential for strong negative emotional readings. The clean, though slightly organic, lines between the color fields enhance a sense of deliberate construction rather than impulsive expression. Ultimately, any feeling of anger derived from this piece would likely be minimal and highly subjective, projected onto the intensity of the color rather than being an inherent or intended emotional output of the artwork itself. The overall impression leans towards a meditative exploration of color and form, far removed from the turbulent or explosive qualities often associated with visual representations of anger."
orange-over-violet-1968.jpg,colorField,3.0,"This painting evokes very little to no anger. The overall composition and color palette contribute to a sense of calm, contemplation, and atmospheric depth, rather than emotional upheaval or aggression.

Here's a breakdown of why anger is largely absent:
*   **Color Psychology:**
    *   The dominant upper section is a soft, muted lavender, a color typically associated with tranquility, spirituality, or peace, not anger.
    *   The large central band is a warm, earthy amber or golden-brown. These hues are generally comforting, inviting, and natural, far from evoking rage or hostility.
    *   The lower section is a gentle off-white or pale cream, symbolizing purity, calmness, or a blank slate, again, not anger.
    *   While there are two bands of red, traditionally associated with passion, energy, or anger, in this context, they are subdued. The lower red is a deep, almost brick-red, lending warmth and grounding rather than aggressive intensity. The thinner red border above the amber is more of a defining line than an explosion of furious color.
    *   The thin black horizontal line within the red border is the most ""disruptive"" element. Black can sometimes be associated with darkness or oppression, but this line is very narrow and appears more like a subtle fissure or a graphic accent rather than an overwhelming, rage-inducing presence. It creates a very minor sense of tension or interruption, but not outright anger.
*   **Composition and Form:**
    *   The stacked, rectangular forms create a sense of stability and balance, characteristic of color field painting. There are no sharp, jagged lines, chaotic brushstrokes, or clashing forms that might suggest conflict or aggression.
    *   The edges of the color blocks are soft, blurry, and atmospheric, which draws the viewer into a meditative state rather than exciting them with anger. Hard, defined edges or aggressive textures would be more indicative of anger.
*   **Overall Impression:** The painting invites quiet introspection and a sense of vastness or deep space. It feels serene and immersive. Any slight tension introduced by the black line or the reds is extremely subtle and does not escalate to the emotion of anger. The painting lacks the visual cues typically associated with anger, such as harsh contrasts, violent movement, or a sense of agitation."
orange-red-orange-1961.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The painting, a classic Rothko, features two large, soft-edged rectangular color fields: a warm orangey-red above a burnt orange/brown, set against a luminous yellow-gold background. While the color red can be associated with anger, the specific shade used here is a deep, earthy, and warm orange-red rather than a sharp, aggressive, or violent red. This hue, combined with the other colors, evokes warmth, passion, or a deep, internal resonance, but not outward rage or fury. The edges of the color blocks are intentionally soft, blurred, and atmospheric, which contributes to a feeling of gentle diffusion and contemplation rather than sharp aggression or turbulent energy commonly associated with anger. The composition is simple, monumental, and balanced, lacking any chaotic elements, jagged lines, or dynamic tension that might suggest an angry outburst. Instead, the painting invites a quiet, meditative, and introspective response. The overall mood conveyed by the soft forms, harmonious color palette, and subtle luminosity is one of stillness, depth, and perhaps a sublime intensity, which stands in direct contrast to the agitated, disruptive, or explosive nature of anger. Therefore, the visual language of this artwork offers very little to suggest the emotion of anger."
papier-d-coup-1967.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The artwork, with its rhythmic repetition of diagonal strokes and simple primary colors (red, blue-green, yellow), offers very little to evoke anger. The lines, while energetic in their diagonal thrust, are not sharp, aggressive, or chaotic in a way that would suggest rage or frustration. They form neat, predictable patterns, creating a sense of order and perhaps even playfulness, rather than disruption or conflict. The colors are bright and distinct, but they harmonize well within the repetitive structure, lacking any jarring clashes or somber tones that might resonate with feelings of anger or irritation. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, its use here is as part of a cheerful, almost systematic pattern, not in a way that feels aggressive or confrontational. The visible seams between the paper squares suggest a handmade quality, which adds a certain warmth or humility rather than any agitated tension. The overall impression is one of rhythmic calm and simple visual pleasure, far removed from the turbulent or explosive nature of anger."
pocahontas-1978.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract composition of vertical stripes in muted and harmonious tones of purple, green, brown, and grey, presents no visual cues that would evoke or represent anger. The colors are subdued and blend seamlessly, lacking the sharp contrasts, fiery reds, or aggressive hues often associated with this emotion. The lines are strictly vertical and orderly, creating a sense of calm and structure rather than the chaotic, jagged, or turbulent lines that might suggest frustration or rage. The subtle texture, resembling wood grain or brushed fabric, is gentle and repetitive, devoid of any agitated or violent brushstrokes. There is no discernible subject matter or narrative that could imply conflict, aggression, or a cause for anger. The overall impression is one of tranquility, perhaps a touch of introspection due to the subdued palette, but certainly not anger. The score is not an absolute zero only because, as an emotional response to abstract art, a fractional possibility, however minuscule, can theoretically exist for an extremely subjective and idiosyncratic interpretation. However, objectively, no elements support an association with anger."
painting-1-75-1975.jpg,colorField,55.0,"The painting, dominated by a large, dark, reddish-brown rectangle set against a slightly lighter, purplish-brown border, evokes a sense of deep, contained emotion. While not expressing overt or explosive anger, several elements subtly suggest a brooding, internalized form of this emotion. The color itself, a very deep and heavy red-brown, carries a significant emotional weight; it's dense and dark, reminiscent of a compressed or"
janela-aberta-1998.jpg,colorField,4.0,"The overall collection of paintings, while featuring a significant presence of reds and oranges, does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. The reds predominantly lean towards warm, earthy, or deep hues rather than harsh, jarring, or aggressive tones typically associated with rage. Many of the paintings feature solid blocks of color or abstract depictions of interiors, which tend to create a sense of focused study, warmth, or enclosure rather than explosive emotion.

The brushwork, while visible and expressive in some instances, lacks the frantic, violent, or chaotic energy that would convey anger. There are no sharp, jagged lines, aggressive forms, or clashing color combinations designed to create a sense of visual conflict or distress. Instead, the strokes often appear deliberate, creating textures or defining abstract spaces. Even in the darker or more confined compositions, the prevailing mood feels more contemplative, somber, or introspective rather than furious or agitated. The intensity present in some of the red fields suggests passion or energy, but not specifically the aggressive nature of anger."
ph-1033-1976.jpg,colorField,93.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of anger, primarily through its dominant use of vivid red and the energetic, jagged forms. The intense, almost blistering red covers a significant portion of the canvas, immediately associating the artwork with powerful emotions like fury, aggression, and passion. This specific shade of red is not muted or subdued; it is a raw, unadulterated hue that demands attention, much like an outburst of anger.

The forms themselves contribute significantly to this emotional resonance. They are sharp, upward-thrusting, and irregular, reminiscent of chaotic flames, tearing motions, or aggressive, unchecked energy. There is a distinct lack of smooth lines or gentle curves; instead, the brushstrokes appear forceful, almost slashing, conveying a sense of violent eruption or an uncontrolled surge of emotion. The way these red ""flares"" ascend and spread across the canvas creates a dynamic and agitated composition, mirroring the internal turmoil and explosive nature of anger.

The stark contrast between the vibrant red and the pale, almost off-white background further amplifies the intensity of the anger. The neutral background does not soften the impact but rather highlights the aggressive dominance of the red, making it feel more urgent and pronounced. The visible, expressive brushwork adds to the raw, uncontained feeling, suggesting the immediacy and rawness of an angry state. Even the darker, more muted tones on the right side could be interpreted as residual or smoldering aspects of this intense emotion, maintaining the overall atmosphere of agitation. There are no elements within the painting that suggest calm, resolution, or softness; instead, every visual cue points to a potent and unbridled emotional display of anger."
peeping-wall-1960.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The emotion of anger is barely, if at all, evoked by this painting, hence the very low score. The composition is highly orderly and repetitive, featuring a series of clean, vertical stripes. This structure conveys a sense of calm, precision, and rhythmic regularity rather than any chaotic or disruptive energy often associated with anger. While the color red is present, which can sometimes be linked to strong emotions, here it appears as a flat, unagitated block, balanced by cooler tones like light blue and royal blue, and softer hues like pink and yellow. There is no sense of clashing, discord, or aggressive interaction between the colors or forms. The stripes are uniformly wide and evenly spaced, lacking any jagged lines, sharp points, or dynamic visual tension that might suggest aggression or agitation. The overall impression is one of harmonious coexistence and visual serenity, almost like a textile pattern, completely devoid of any visual triggers for frustration, hostility, or rage."
polar-co-ordinates-v-1980.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The visual elements present in the artwork actively work against any interpretation of hostility or aggression. The color palette is composed of muted, earthy tones—various shades of brown, green, cream, and a soft teal, with small, gentle accents of yellow and pink. These colors are harmonious and do not possess the intensity, sharpness, or clashing qualities often associated with expressions of anger (such as vivid reds, harsh blacks, or jarring contrasts). Furthermore, the forms are predominantly curvilinear and organic, flowing into one another in a somewhat decorative or abstract botanical arrangement. While some forms have pointed ends, they are not sharp, jagged, or threatening; instead, they contribute to a sense of dynamic movement rather than aggression. The underlying grid pattern, though somewhat distorted, provides a sense of structure and order rather than chaos or turmoil. There are no frenetic brushstrokes, disquieting compositions, or confrontational visual elements that would suggest agitation, frustration, or rage. The overall impression is one of calm, intricate design, and perhaps a gentle, almost meditative energy, utterly devoid of any angry sentiment."
pink-flutter-1969.jpg,colorField,12.0,"The visual characteristics of this image offer very little to directly evoke the emotion of anger. While the palette is dominated by warm hues such as oranges and yellows, with interspersed deeper reds, these colors predominantly contribute to an impression of warmth, luminosity, and perhaps intensity, rather than aggression or rage. The red tones, often associated with anger, are here largely integrated into a flowing, translucent aesthetic, appearing more as glowing veins or liquid currents rather than fiery bursts or confrontational statements.

The forms themselves are fluid and organic, characterized by vertical streaks and irregular blotches, suggestive of materials that are flowing or stained. This fluidity lacks the sharp edges, violent brushstrokes, or chaotic fragmentation typically employed to convey anger in abstract art. There is no sense of disruption, aggression, or turmoil in the composition; instead, the patterns appear somewhat natural and rhythmic, akin to light filtering through colored glass or viscous liquids moving slowly. The small, scattered bright pink or red specks, while adding a slight visual ""pop,"" are too sparse and minor to contribute significantly to a feeling of irritation or explosion, which could be linked to anger.

Overall, the image presents a luminous and somewhat ethereal quality, more aligned with a vibrant energy or an unfolding natural process than with the destructive, confrontational, or frustrated aspects of anger. Any intensity perceived is more akin to warmth or vibrancy rather than a fiery outburst or simmering rage, thus resulting in a very low score for the emotion of anger."
purple-color-field-with-two-green-lines.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The visual language of this painting offers very little to suggest the emotion of anger. The dominant color is a deep, muted reddish-brown or plum, which, while containing red (a color often associated with anger), is too subdued and earthy to evoke a sense of fiery rage or aggression. It reads more as somber, contemplative, or even barren, rather than agitated. There are no sharp, jagged lines or chaotic, clashing forms that might convey conflict or intensity. Instead, the composition is highly minimalist, featuring strong horizontal elements. Horizontal lines typically convey stability, tranquility, or a vast, open expanse, which are counter to the turbulent and disruptive nature of anger. The bright green line, while a strong contrast, feels more like a deliberate, almost serene separation or a hint of life, rather than a jarring or aggressive element. The textured reddish-brown and orange shape beneath it could be interpreted as earth or a landscape, but its portrayal lacks any dynamic tension or visual 'shout' that would signify anger. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, starkness, or perhaps a desolate landscape, far removed from any sense of fury or frustration. A score of 5 is given only because the presence of deep red tones, however muted, might hold a *very tenuous* and subconscious link to the color red's typical association with strong emotions, but this is heavily mitigated by all other visual cues."
rb-ps-2-15-1990.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The visual elements in this composition offer virtually no cues that would evoke a sense of anger. The lines are strictly vertical, perfectly straight, and evenly spaced, conveying order, precision, and stability rather than chaos or agitation. The color palette, consisting of shades of light gray, white, and a deep, muted purple, lacks the intensity, warmth, or jarring contrast often associated with anger. The purple, while deep, is more contemplative or serene than aggressive. There are no sharp, dynamic, or aggressive forms, nor any textural qualities that suggest turmoil or distress. The overall impression is one of calm, structure, and a quiet, almost meditative presence, which stands in direct opposition to the expression of anger. The score is not an absolute zero to acknowledge the subjective nature of emotional response, but it is as close as possible, as there are no discernible visual elements to suggest this emotion."
pink-stripe-1960.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, characterized by its strict vertical stripes of vibrant green and light blue, with a narrow pink stripe accenting the far left, possesses very few, if any, inherent qualities that would evoke anger in a viewer. Anger typically arises from feelings of threat, injustice, aggression, frustration, or discord. This artwork presents none of these elements.

The composition is highly orderly and static, devoid of any dynamic or chaotic elements that might suggest confrontation or aggression. The lines are clean and precise, contributing to a sense of calm and visual stability rather than agitation. The colors, while bright and saturated, are generally perceived as harmonious and pleasing when placed side-by-side, rather than clashing or jarring in a way that could provoke irritation or anger. There is no disturbing imagery, overt symbolism of conflict, or narrative content that could trigger a negative emotional response.

The only extremely marginal, and highly subjective, interpretation that *could* lead to even the faintest glimmer of a feeling related to anger (such as minor irritation or annoyance) might stem from the painting's extreme regularity and lack of organic form. For some viewers, an overwhelming sense of order or repetition, or the perceived ""artificiality"" of the flat, unmodulated colors, could lead to a *very slight* feeling of monotony or restriction. Similarly, the subtle asymmetry introduced by the narrow pink stripe on the left could, for someone fixated on perfect symmetry, cause a fleeting moment of cognitive dissonance or minor annoyance. However, these are highly individualized and tenuous links to anger, representing an almost negligible potential for this emotion. The overwhelming visual evidence points to a painting designed for aesthetic contemplation of color and form, not emotional provocation of a negative kind. Therefore, the score is extremely low, reflecting the near absence of any anger-evoking properties."
red-with-white-triangle-1961.jpg,colorField,5.0,"As an art expert analyzing the emotional resonance of this piece, the evocation of anger is remarkably low. The dominant color, a vibrant, saturated orange, while often associated with energy, passion, and sometimes intensity, does not here lean towards aggression or wrath. Instead, its brightness suggests warmth, optimism, or a dynamic forward momentum rather than confrontational ire.

The central white triangular form, resembling an upward-pointing arrow or a rocket, conveys a sense of direction, ascent, or aspiration. Its sharp, clean lines and symmetrical presentation are precise and controlled, devoid of any chaotic energy or violent thrust that might instigate feelings of anger. There is no perceived struggle, tension, or conflict within the composition. The solitary, vertical dark line anchoring the triangle further emphasizes stability and a clear trajectory, rather than a disruptive or frustrating element.

The minimalism and stark contrast create a focused, almost serene impression, despite the intensity of the orange. There are no figures expressing rage, no scenes of injustice or struggle, and no visual metaphors for hostility or resentment. The overall visual impact is one of pure form and color, suggesting progress or a singular focus, which are not intrinsically linked to the emotion of anger. Any potential for anger is merely a fleeting, almost imperceptible byproduct of the intense hue, but it is overwhelmingly mitigated by the clean, aspirational, and harmonious composition."
raval-rojo-2004.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The painting evokes a significant degree of anger primarily through its bold and assertive use of color and the directness of its application. The prominent presence of a vibrant, unyielding red, especially in the bottom half, is strongly associated with passion, heat, and aggression, key components of anger. This red is powerfully juxtaposed with large, heavy blocks of black, which contribute a sense of weight, severity, and stark contrast. The intense visual tension created by the high contrast between these dark, somber blacks and the fiery reds (and even the bright yellow) generates a feeling of confrontation or unresolved force. While the composition is structured with rectilinear forms, the visible, broad brushstrokes prevent a sense of calm or serenity; instead, they convey a raw, unrefined energy and a forceful application of paint, suggesting a direct and unyielding emotional expression. The overall impression is one of a simmering intensity and powerful emotional weight, rather than chaotic rage, but certainly a potent and palpable sense of forceful, perhaps even suppressed, anger."
red-dog-1961.jpg,colorField,78.0,"The emotion of anger is strongly evoked in this painting, primarily through the dominant use of the color red. Red is universally associated with passion, energy, aggression, and anger, and its prominent placement as a bold, solid vertical band immediately draws the eye and communicates a forceful presence. This vivid red stands in stark contrast to the subdued, dark blue-black vertical stripes that compose the majority of the image. The abrupt shift from the somber, repetitive pattern of the dark stripes to the intense, unyielding red creates a visual jolt, akin to a sudden outburst or a potent emotional assertion. The strict verticality and unwavering form of the red band contribute to a sense of unyielding determination or rigid force, which can be interpreted as a controlled yet intense form of anger or defiance. While the overall composition is ordered and minimalist, preventing a chaotic depiction of rage, the sheer intensity and visual dominance of the red against the darker background make the presence of anger undeniable and impactful. The narrow green stripe at the very edge offers a slight visual counterpoint but is insufficient to significantly dilute the powerful emotional statement made by the red."
paisagem-mayor-2009.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally evoked by this collection of abstract paintings. While the prominent use of vibrant reds, a color often associated with intense emotions including anger, and the visible, vigorous brushstrokes in many pieces suggest a certain intensity and force, these elements do not coalesce into a pervasive feeling of anger. The energetic application of paint appears more as dynamic artistic expression and lively experimentation rather than an outburst of frustration or aggression. Furthermore, the reds are frequently balanced or contrasted with bright, often cheerful, yellows, blues, and greens, which tend to mitigate any potentially harsh or confrontational undertones. The overall impression is one of vibrant movement, visual excitement, and bold color interplay rather than distress or rage. The individual pieces, despite their energetic qualities, combine to form an engaging and visually stimulating display that lacks the visual dissonance, chaotic composition, or dark, oppressive tones typically associated with conveying anger in art. Therefore, any sense of anger is extremely subdued, almost imperceptible amidst the prevailing vivacity and dynamic abstract forms."
rose-sun-box-nr-2-1969.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this painting that would evoke a feeling of anger. The composition is entirely static and balanced, featuring a large, soft pink rectangle centered within a warm, earthy orange-brown border. There are no aggressive lines, sharp angles, or discordant forms that might suggest conflict or tension. The color palette itself, comprising gentle pinks and subdued browns, is inherently soft and harmonious, devoid of any vibrant, clashing, or harsh tones typically associated with anger or agitation. The overall impression is one of profound tranquility and stillness, which stands in direct opposition to any sense of anger or frustration. The painting offers no visual cues or gestural qualities that could be interpreted as forceful, aggressive, or upsetting."
ressurection-1966.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The primary visual elements—color, composition, and form—all actively work against any association with this emotion. The color palette is dominated by bright, vibrant hues ranging from luminous yellows and oranges to rich reds, purples, and blues, culminating in a soft greenish-yellow center. These colors, while intense, are presented in a harmonious, rainbow-like progression that feels energetic and joyful rather than aggressive or confrontational. Anger is often associated with darker, muddier, or violently clashing colors, none of which are present here.

Furthermore, the composition of concentric circles is inherently orderly, symmetrical, and radiating. This structured, balanced arrangement promotes feelings of calm, focus, or expansion, completely counteracting the agitation, chaos, or rupture often linked to anger. The individual, irregular block-like elements that form the mosaic-like pattern contribute to a sense of crafted texture and visual interest, but they do not suggest jaggedness, violence, or disharmony. There are no sharp, aggressive lines, no turbulent brushstrokes (implied by the blocky forms), and no disorienting visual tension. The overall impression is one of warmth, light, visual pleasure, and harmonious unity, leaving no room for the disruptive or discordant sensation of anger."
rose-rose-london-2012-olympic-games-poster-2012.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are no elements within this artwork that evoke anger. The composition consists of evenly spaced horizontal stripes in a harmonious palette of soft, pastel colors including pinks, oranges, greens, blues, and yellows. These colors are generally perceived as calming, pleasant, or cheerful, rather than stimulating emotions like anger, frustration, or aggression. The orderly and balanced arrangement of the stripes contributes to a sense of stability and peace, completely devoid of any visual tension, discord, or abruptness that might trigger an angry response. There are no harsh lines, jarring contrasts, violent imagery, or chaotic forms present. The overall visual experience is one of tranquility and aesthetic pleasure, offering no foundation for an emotion as intense as anger."
red-white-and-brown.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The painting evokes a significant degree of anger, primarily through its overwhelming use of intense, hot colors, particularly the dominant reds and oranges. Red is universally associated with strong emotions such as passion, urgency, danger, and most pertinently, anger and rage. The entire canvas is drenched in a deep, saturated red, creating an immediate and almost confrontational visual field that demands attention and can feel highly charged.

The dark, almost bruised reddish-brown rectangle at the top introduces a somber, heavy, and potentially brooding quality, suggesting a deep-seated or suppressed anger. This contrasts with the fiery, vibrant orange of the large central block, which, while energetic, contributes to the overall thermal intensity and can be perceived as a boiling or simmering emotion. The vibrant orange, set against the equally strong red, creates a powerful optical tension that can feel agitated or unsettling.

While the forms are rectangular and lack the chaotic, jagged lines or aggressive brushstrokes often explicitly associated with anger in art, their sheer size and commanding presence within the intense color field can feel overwhelming. This immersion in such a potent, hot palette can evoke feelings of being consumed by emotion, or an internal agitation that resonates with anger. The soft, bleeding edges, typical of Rothko, rather than softening the intensity, allow the colors to permeate and envelop the viewer, making the emotional impact more pervasive.

The stark white rectangle at the bottom, rather than offering peace, provides a sharp, almost blinding contrast to the fiery hues above. This abrupt transition can be interpreted as a raw, exposed nerve or an explosive burst of intensity, further contributing to a sense of profound emotional charge that can verge on frustration or a heightened"
red.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting, rating very low on the scale. While the dominant color is a deep red, which is often associated with strong emotions including anger, the way this color is applied and the overall composition significantly diminish any sense of rage or aggression. The red itself is a rich, velvety, and deep hue rather than a bright, fiery, or aggressive one, leaning more towards solemnity, passion, or profound introspection than outward fury.

Furthermore, the characteristics of the painting actively work against the visual language typically associated with anger. The edges of the color fields are soft, blurred, and atmospheric, lacking any sharp or jagged lines that might suggest agitation, conflict, or violence. The composition is balanced and static, with large, rectangular blocks of color that create a sense of monumentality and calm, rather than turbulence or disarray. There are no dynamic or chaotic elements, nor are there any harsh contrasts or aggressive brushstrokes that would typically convey anger. The overall effect is one of immersive contemplation and profound depth, inviting the viewer into a space of quiet emotion rather than provoking an agitated or furious response. Any perceived connection to anger would be extremely tenuous, stemming solely from a generic association with the color red, which is heavily counteracted by the painting's serene and contemplative execution."
sabra-iii-1967.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting is an abstract, geometric composition featuring two fan-like or quarter-circle shapes filled with radiating segments of various colors. While the color red is present in several areas, which can sometimes be associated with anger or passion, its presence here is not dominant or used in a way that suggests aggression, rage, or fury. The colors are varied and include warm tones (red, orange, yellow, brown) and cool tones (blue, grey, green), creating a balanced, albeit vibrant, palette. The shapes are precise, clean, and orderly, with radiating lines that suggest expansion or design rather than conflict or disruption. There are no jagged, chaotic, or violent forms. The overall composition is stable and structured, lacking any visual tension, discord, or imbalance that might evoke feelings of anger. The aesthetic leans towards decorative pattern and calm arrangement rather than emotional outburst. The very low score reflects the near complete absence of visual cues typically associated with anger in abstract art."
royal-canoe-1977.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The visual elements within this painting offer very little to evoke or represent anger. Anger is often conveyed through sharp, jagged lines, chaotic compositions, jarring color clashes, or explosive forms. In contrast, this piece is characterized by extreme precision, rigid vertical lines, and a highly ordered, repetitive structure. The overall composition is meticulously controlled and static, which runs counter to the dynamic and often chaotic nature associated with anger.

While the left side features a dominant deep red or burgundy hue, a color sometimes associated with passion or anger, its specific shade here is rich and deep rather than fiery or aggressive. Furthermore, its pairing with muted beige and a soft lavender, and its placement within a perfectly orderly striped pattern, neutralizes any potential for an aggressive interpretation. The strict regularity and predictable rhythm of these stripes convey a sense of calm, measured design rather than emotional intensity or frustration.

The right side introduces a wider spectrum of colors and much narrower stripes, creating a different visual texture. However, these colors, many of which are pastels or soft tones (blues, pinks, light yellows), do not clash in a way that suggests conflict or agitation. Instead, they contribute to an optical effect that is more about visual vibration and subtle shifts than emotional outburst. The meticulous execution and the aesthetic focus on pattern and color interaction effectively suppress any latent sense of anger, leaving the viewer with an impression of deliberate, almost mathematical, composition. There is no visual tension that translates into an angry sentiment; rather, it is a controlled exercise in visual rhythm and color play."
robinson-s-wrap-1974.jpg,colorField,17.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally evoked by this painting. The most direct association with anger stems from the prominent, deep red color that dominates the lower and central portions of the composition. Red is often symbolically linked to passion, intensity, and by extension, anger or rage. However, the manner in which this red is rendered significantly mitigates any strong sense of aggression or volatile anger. The color is deep, rich, and somewhat translucent, applied in washes or layers rather than with sharp, jagged strokes or explosive gestures. This fluid, almost atmospheric application lacks the harshness, agitation, or confrontational energy typically associated with visual representations of anger. The edges of the red form are soft and organic, not sharp or violent. While the large, heavy mass of red might suggest a profound or weighty emotion, it does not inherently translate into outward hostility or rage. There are no clashing elements, chaotic movements, or aggressive textures that would typically signify an angry emotional state. The overall impression leans more towards contemplation or a deep, internal presence rather than an overt expression of anger."
saraband-1959.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The predominant visual elements contribute to a feeling that is diametrically opposed to rage, frustration, or aggression. The color palette, while containing some darker tones and hints of red, is overwhelmingly muted, blended, and harmonious. There are no sharp, clashing, or vibrant hues that would typically signify an angry emotional state. Instead, the colors flow into one another with a gentle, almost meditative quality, creating a sense of calm and introspection rather than agitation or turbulence.

Furthermore, the brushstrokes are soft, fluid, and predominantly vertical, giving the impression of gentle descent or quiet layering. There are no jagged lines, harsh contrasts, or violent applications of paint that would convey a feeling of aggression, tension, or explosive energy. The overall composition is orderly and serene, lacking any chaotic elements, visual conflict, or disarray that might be associated with anger. The transparency and layering of the colors suggest a quiet unfolding rather than an intense outburst. The absence of any discernible figures or explicit forms that could express rage further contributes to the complete lack of anger in this piece. The artwork promotes a sense of tranquility and quiet observation, which stands in stark opposition to the characteristics of anger."
samba-2005.jpg,colorField,87.5,"The most prominent element conveying anger in this artwork is the intense, vibrant red color. Red is universally associated with strong emotions, particularly anger, passion, and warning. Here, the red is not muted or softened; it is a raw, almost aggressive hue that immediately draws the eye. The stark contrast between this vivid red and the deep, oppressive black background creates significant visual tension, which can be a powerful conveyor of emotional turmoil and conflict. The black background itself can feel heavy or foreboding, making the red appear like a sudden, forceful eruption or an exposed, raw nerve.

Furthermore, the forms of the red shapes, while abstract, are irregular and somewhat raw, lacking smooth refinement. They appear almost like primal marks or the result of vigorous, uninhibited brushstrokes, contributing to a sense of unbridled emotion. The texture of the paint, particularly visible in the black, adds to this raw, non-harmonious feeling. There is no sense of calm or tranquility; instead, the overall composition feels weighty, confrontational, and charged with an intense, unyielding energy that strongly resonates with the sensation of anger. The isolated placement of the red forms on the vast dark field amplifies their impactful, almost defiant presence, like a bold outburst against a consuming void."
segwehce-1965.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The visual language of this painting is overwhelmingly characterized by order, stability, and a systematic arrangement of color, which fundamentally counters any strong evocation of anger. The composition consists of perfectly horizontal, equally wide stripes, creating a sense of flatness, calm, and deliberate structure. There are no dynamic or chaotic elements—no aggressive brushstrokes, jagged lines, or turbulent forms that typically signify agitation or rage. The colors, while distinct, are presented as flat, untextured fields, devoid of any expressive application that might suggest emotional intensity. Even the central red stripe, often associated with anger, is contained within this highly controlled and balanced framework. Its presence is not one of explosion or conflict, but rather a deliberate placement within a chromatic sequence. The surrounding cool blues and greens, along with the contemplative purples and stable yellows, further mitigate any potential for the red to stand out as an angry element; instead, it becomes one color among others in a harmonious, almost meditative study of pure color relationships. The overall impression is one of stark control and neutrality, leaving virtually no room for the disruptive, volatile energy that defines anger."
sevastipol-2003.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The composition is highly ordered, featuring neat, vertical bands of color. This geometric precision and structured layout convey a strong sense of stability, control, and calm, which are antithetical to the disruptive and chaotic nature often associated with anger. While some colors like red and black can sometimes be linked to intense emotions, here they are presented within a balanced and harmonious palette that includes soothing blues, warm oranges, and soft peach tones. There are no sharp, aggressive angles, clashing forms, or turbulent brushwork that would suggest agitation or fury. The smooth, flat application of color and the consistent verticality contribute to a serene and contemplative atmosphere, utterly devoid of any visual cues that might trigger or reflect feelings of anger."
sem-titulo-1988.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The primary element contributing to any potential feeling of anger is the dominant, intense red-orange hue, which in some contexts can be associated with heat, passion, and fury. This pervasive warmth might evoke a very subtle, underlying sense of simmering intensity or contained energy, which is a component of anger. However, the emotional resonance of anger in this painting is exceptionally low. There are no aggressive or agitated brushstrokes, chaotic compositions, sharp angles, or violent forms that typically communicate rage or disruption. The subtle, almost etched lines across the surface are not jagged or forceful; instead, they appear as faint, almost embedded marks that suggest a quiet imperfection or subtle shift rather than a violent gesture. The overall uniformity and monolithic quality of the color field create a sense of profound stillness rather than active agitation. The specific shade of red-orange also leans towards an earthy, almost terracotta tone, which tends to evoke warmth, vitality, or deep earthiness more readily than pure, destructive anger. Without any visual cues of conflict, tension, or uncontrolled release, the intensity of the color remains more meditative or immersive than overtly aggressive, thereby significantly diminishing any substantial evocation of anger."
red-baron-1978.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. While the prominent red color in the right panel is often associated with intense emotions, including anger, passion, or danger, its presentation within this specific artwork significantly dampens any such interpretation. The composition is highly geometric, ordered, and static, featuring two balanced rectangular fields. There are no chaotic lines, aggressive brushstrokes, jagged forms, or clashing elements that typically convey agitation, conflict, or rage. The subtle vertical striations in both color fields are uniform and regular, contributing to a sense of calm texture rather than visual disturbance. The overall impression is one of controlled study and visual harmony, rather than emotional outburst. Therefore, despite the presence of a strong red, the complete absence of visual cues for aggression, tension, or disarray renders the presence of anger almost negligible."
seward-park-1958.jpg,colorField,82.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of anger, bordering on simmering rage or profound frustration, primarily through its stark color contrast and heavy, imposing forms. The dominant use of black, particularly in the large central block and the thick horizontal stripes, creates an overwhelming sense of obstruction, oppression, or a powerful, negative force. These black elements cut through and constrain the vibrant yellow, which, instead of feeling cheerful, takes on a feeling of being stifled, suffocated, or under attack. The yellow, when juxtaposed with such heavy black, can even feel like a raw nerve or a heightened state of agitation.

The composition, with its rigid horizontal lines and large, unyielding black mass, communicates a lack of flow or harmony, replaced by confrontation and a jarring visual tension. The black stripes could be interpreted as bars, limits, or repeated forceful actions, contributing to a feeling of being trapped or repeatedly assaulted. The central black rectangle acts as a profound void or an impenetrable barrier, directly interrupting and weighing down the visual field, which can be intensely frustrating and infuriating. The dark, somber green at the bottom does not offer a sense of calm or escape; instead, it provides a heavy, grounding base for the intense conflict unfolding above, amplifying the overall feeling of solemnity and unresolved tension. There is no softness, subtlety, or gentle transition in the painting; instead, it presents a raw, unadulterated visual argument that directly conveys aggression, profound discontent, and a powerful, unyielding opposition. This makes the painting feel deeply unsettling and charged with a potent, almost visceral anger."
smithsonian-resident-associates-program-1985-20th-anniversary-poster-1985.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork evokes virtually no sense of anger. Its composition is characterized by stark minimalism, precise geometric forms, and orderly vertical lines. The large, dominant black areas create a sense of calm, void, or groundedness rather than aggression or frustration. The thin, colorful stripes, while providing visual contrast, are arranged with methodical precision, suggesting rhythm and design rather than chaos or agitation. The colors themselves are varied but do not clash in a way that would produce visual discord or a feeling of unrest. There are no jagged edges, aggressive textures, violent imagery, or chaotic elements that typically contribute to feelings of anger. The overall impression is one of visual balance, controlled execution, and abstract contemplation, which are antithetical to the experience of anger."
silvio-set-one-1963.jpg,colorField,62.0,"The emotion of anger is notably present in this painting, primarily conveyed through the kinetic and forceful application of paint. The most prominent indicator is the pervasive presence of **splatters** of various colors, particularly bright red, yellow, and blue, scattered across the white canvas. These splatters visually represent an uncontained, explosive release of energy, akin to the outward manifestation of an angry outburst or a fit of rage. The seemingly uncontrolled, widespread nature of these marks suggests a loss of composure and a forceful, almost aggressive, action.

Furthermore, the significant use of **red** pigment, especially within the splatters and some of the linear elements, strongly reinforces the feeling of anger. Red is culturally and psychologically linked to heightened emotions, including frustration, aggression, and fury. Its prominent scattering across the composition amplifies this association.

The visible **drips** of paint, particularly from the larger blue forms, contribute to a sense of emotional intensity and a lack of containment. These uncontrolled streams suggest a breakdown or dissolution, mirroring the turmoil and loss of composure that can accompany anger. The raw, unrefined quality of these drips adds to the visceral impact, implying a raw, unrestrained emotion.

Finally, the overall **dynamic and somewhat chaotic composition**, characterized by disparate elements and an absence of calm, ordered forms, can evoke a feeling of tension and agitation. The energetic, almost violent mark-making, combined with the scattered elements, creates a visual environment that is far from serene, suggesting an underlying current of forceful, perhaps even angry, energy."
sour-ball-beat-1964.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent in this painting. The composition consists of consistently straight, vertical stripes, which inherently convey order, repetition, and a rhythmic harmony rather than any sense of chaos, frustration, or aggression typically associated with anger. The lines are clean and precise, devoid of any jaggedness or sharp, conflicting angles that might evoke discomfort or agitation. While the color red is present, often associated with strong emotions including anger, its use here is balanced by a wide spectrum of other vibrant and mostly harmonious colors such as orange, yellow, pink, light green, dark green, and blue. This diverse and balanced palette creates an overall impression that is energetic, cheerful, or decorative, rather than confrontational or hostile. There are no clashing colors that create visual discord, nor are there any dark, oppressive tones that dominate the composition and might suggest a brooding or resentful atmosphere. The painting lacks any discernible figures, narratives, or expressive brushstrokes that could communicate a state of emotional turmoil or ire. Its neat, predictable structure and vibrant, varied colors lean towards a feeling of pleasant regularity and lively appeal, making any interpretation of anger highly unlikely and almost imperceptible."
study-ii-1981.jpg,colorField,5.2,"The visual elements within this abstract composition evoke very little, if any, sensation of anger. The primary colors employed – a deep, somewhat muted red, an olive green, a dark navy blue, and a bright yellow – do not inherently clash or create a sense of aggressive tension. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, the specific shade here is more earthy and subdued than a vibrant, fiery red that might denote rage or passion. The olive green and dark blue are generally calming or stable hues, and the yellow brings a sense of brightness or energy, neither of which are typically linked with anger.

Furthermore, the composition is highly structured and orderly, featuring precise rectilinear blocks. There are no jagged lines, chaotic arrangements, or explosive forms that might suggest agitation or fury. The horizontal orientation and the measured placement of each color block contribute to a sense of balance and composure rather than discord or emotional upheaval. The surface texture appears relatively smooth, lacking the aggressive brushstrokes or turbulent marks often found in art intending to express strong negative emotions like anger. The slightly rough edges of the paper seem more characteristic of the medium (collage or torn paper) than an intentional conveyance of raw emotion. Overall, the artwork emanates a quiet, grounded stability, offering no discernible visual cues that would trigger an emotional response of anger."
summer-palace-1975.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork presents a soft and ethereal aesthetic dominated by delicate pastel pinks, complemented by gentle, fluid yellow and white strokes. There are no visual cues within the composition that suggest anger. The colors used are light and non-confrontational, lacking the intensity, saturation, or darkness often associated with feelings of rage or aggression. The forms are organic, amorphous, and flowing, entirely devoid of the sharp angles, jagged lines, or explosive movements that might convey agitation or hostility. The overall impression is one of tranquility and softness, which stands in direct opposition to the emotion of anger. There is absolutely no visual indication, subtle or overt, to evoke or represent anger in this piece."
starry-night-and-the-astronauts-1972.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting predominantly features shades of blue, a color generally associated with calm, serenity, or melancholia, rather than anger. The technique of small, distinct brushstrokes, while creating a fragmented appearance, does not convey aggression or violent energy; instead, it often creates a sense of texture, light play, or a mosaic-like effect. There are no harsh, jagged lines, violent gestures, or chaotic compositions that typically symbolize wrath or aggression. While there is a contrasting patch of orange and yellow in the upper right, these warm colors, often linked with energy or passion, do not manifest as an angry outburst here. The shapes are relatively contained and the colors, despite their vibrancy, do not clash in a way that evokes irritation or rage. The overall feeling communicated by the artwork is more optical, atmospheric, or contemplative, with any potential tension from the fragmented texture being highly subdued and not leading to a sensation of anger. There is a minimal, almost negligible, potential for very abstract interpretations of underlying tension or slight agitation due to the distinct, separated brushstrokes, but this is far from a direct evocation of anger."
the-howl-of-terror-1967.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The dominant dark blue/purple field, while deep and perhaps somber, lacks the intensity, sharp contrasts, or agitated brushstrokes typically associated with feelings of rage or frustration. The horizontal lines at the bottom, composed of serene whites, blues, pinks, and a deep green, convey stability, calm, and order rather than any form of aggression or disquiet. There are no violent or chaotic forms, no jarring color combinations (such as harsh reds or clashing elements), and no discernible narrative that would imply conflict or fury. The overall composition is structured, balanced, and contemplative, creating a visual experience that is antithetical to the experience of anger."
square-motif-in-white-and-indian-red-1960.jpg,colorField,82.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of anger, primarily through its dominant use of a deep, saturated red color in the upper portion. Red is universally associated with intense emotions, including passion, aggression, and anger, and its sheer volume here amplifies this association significantly. This isn't a soft or warm red; it's a bold, almost confrontational hue that immediately captures attention and imparts a feeling of intensity.

Furthermore, the sharp, stark boundary where the red abruptly meets the white creates a jarring visual division, reminiscent of a sudden rupture or an unyielding ultimatum often associated with anger. The crisp, slightly uneven edge suggests a forceful application or a raw, exposed emotional state.

The addition of the sharp, black linear elements further contributes to this feeling. These lines are rigid, precise, and cut across the composition, acting like visual incisions or barriers. The slightly misaligned and overlapping horizontal lines near the red-white divide introduce a subtle tension and discord, hinting at underlying friction or irritation. The vertical black line grounds the left side of the white space, creating a rigid structure that can be perceived as unyielding or unmoving, traits often found in expressions of anger.

The high contrast between the intense red, the stark white, and the absolute black lines leaves no room for ambiguity or softness, fostering an atmosphere of directness and confrontation. There's no blending or gentle transition; the elements are sharply delineated, much like how anger can be a clear, decisive, and often unyielding emotion. The overall impression is one of potent, perhaps simmering or controlled, but undeniable anger due to the forceful presence of color and the rigid, cutting nature of the lines."
train-landscape-1953.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, composed of three horizontal bands of color (lime green, medium green, and yellow), presents a clean, orderly, and visually harmonious composition. The colors chosen are vibrant and generally associated with nature, freshness, energy, and calm. Lime green and medium green evoke a sense of verdant landscapes and growth, while the bright yellow often symbolizes happiness, optimism, and warmth. There are no elements within the painting—such as aggressive brushwork, jagged lines, dark or clashing color combinations, chaotic arrangement, or disturbing subject matter—that would typically provoke or represent anger. The smooth, flat planes of color and the balanced, horizontal division contribute to a sense of tranquility and stability rather than agitation or hostility. The absence of any visual cues commonly linked to anger results in an extremely low score for this emotion. The score of 0.5 acknowledges the infinitesimal possibility that any strong, contrasting color presence could be interpreted in a highly subjective and unconventional way, but fundamentally, the artwork lacks any intrinsic quality to evoke anger."
twined-columns-ii-1960.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger whatsoever. The color palette consists of soft, blended hues—blues, greens, yellows, purples, oranges, and reds that are muted rather than vibrant or aggressive. These colors are applied in vertical bands with a translucent, ethereal quality, creating a gentle and harmonious effect. There are no sharp edges, jarring contrasts, or chaotic compositions that might convey frustration, aggression, or a turbulent emotional state. Instead, the overall impression is one of calmness, serenity, and spaciousness. The diffused nature of the colors and the quiet balance of the composition actively work against any feeling of agitation or wrath. The slight non-zero score acknowledges the subjective nature of emotional response, but fundamentally, this artwork does not present any visual cues typically associated with anger."
tom-s-furnace-1961.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. Anger, when expressed visually in art, often manifests through turbulent compositions, jagged or aggressive forms, clashing and disharmonious color combinations, or a general sense of chaos and unrest. This artwork, however, presents a stark contrast to such characteristics. Its composition is defined by strict vertical lines, creating a highly organized and orderly pattern. The repetition of these stripes, whether in the blue/teal sections or the orange/yellow center, lends itself to a feeling of rhythm and regularity rather than agitation or fury. The colors, while vibrant, are either complementary (blue and orange) or closely related (teal with blue, yellow with orange), leading to clear distinctions rather than jarring conflicts. There is a clean, precise execution of the lines, indicating control and intention, which is antithetical to the explosive or uncontrolled nature often associated with anger. The overall impression is one of geometric precision, balance, and visual structure, leaving no room for the disruptive or aggressive emotions linked to anger."
thira-1980.jpg,colorField,3.0,"The geometric abstraction of the painting, characterized by its precise lines, orderly arrangement of shapes, and balanced composition, largely precludes the evocation of anger. Anger is often associated with visual elements that convey chaos, discord, aggression, or a sense of turbulent conflict. This artwork, however, presents a controlled and stable visual environment. The forms are static and well-defined, devoid of any jaggedness, violent motion, or unsettling imbalance that might agitate a viewer. While the palette includes vibrant reds, these hues are integrated into a larger scheme alongside calming greens, blues, and muted tones, preventing them from dominating in an aggressive or confrontational manner. The overall impression is one of design, precision, and visual harmony, which stands in direct contrast to feelings of rage or frustration. Any minimal perceived intensity from the strong color blocks is contained within an overwhelmingly structured and non-confrontational framework, thus barely registering as an impulse towards anger."
the-station-of-the-cross-first-station-1958.jpg,colorField,63.5,"The emotion of anger is primarily conveyed through the dominant dark, vertical stroke on the right side of the canvas. The application of this dark pigment appears forceful and raw, almost resembling a ""gash"" or a powerful strike against the otherwise serene, light background. The irregular, smudged, and uneven edges of the dark line, coupled with variations in its opacity and texture, strongly suggest an uninhibited, rapid, and perhaps even violent gestural act. This visceral mark-making inherently carries a sense of aggression and intense emotional release. The stark contrast between the turbulent, heavy black and the vast, calm off-white expanse creates a significant visual tension. While the anger is not chaotic or spread across the entire composition, its concentrated and impactful presence within this singular, imposing vertical gesture speaks to a focused or contained fury. The thin, sharp white line bisecting the dark mass could also be interpreted as a piercing or cutting element, further amplifying the sense of a sharp, potentially angry, incision. The overall impression is one of a potent, direct emotional statement rather than a subtle hint of anger."
tdb.jpg,colorField,72.5,"The painting conveys a significant degree of anger, primarily through the forceful use of color and the rigid, unyielding structure of its composition. The most prominent contributor is the stark, vertical block of intense red on the left side. Red is universally associated with strong emotions, particularly anger, passion, and confrontation. Here, it is presented as an unadulterated, immovable mass, asserting its presence with an almost confrontational intensity, embodying a raw and contained fury.

The vast expanse of deep, earthy brown that dominates the canvas further contributes to this sense of anger. Its heavy, monolithic nature can evoke feelings of oppression, stagnation, or a stifling environment, which can breed frustration and resentment that are precursors to or manifestations of anger. This dominant brown field acts as a weighty backdrop against which the red asserts itself, amplifying its impact.

The thin, precise light blue horizontal line cutting across"
two-edges-1948.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting exhibits no visual characteristics that would convey or evoke the emotion of anger. The color palette, composed predominantly of earthy browns and muted beiges, is inherently warm and neutral, lacking the vibrant, aggressive hues (such as reds or harsh oranges) typically associated with rage or agitation. Furthermore, the linear composition, dominated by steady vertical bands, suggests order, stability, and perhaps a contemplative or serene mood, rather than the chaotic, jagged, or explosive forms that might represent anger. There is an absence of turbulent or frenzied brushstrokes; instead, the texture appears relatively smooth and controlled, indicating a deliberate and calm application of paint. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation or natural tranquility, which stands in direct opposition to any sense of fury, aggression, or displeasure. Therefore, anger is completely unrepresented and unevoked by this artwork."
untitled-156-1971.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This image evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The color palette consists of soft, muted tones—light greens, gentle purples, pastel pinks, and various shades of muted yellow and brown. These colors are generally associated with calm, nature, warmth, or tranquility, rather than intense emotions like anger. There are no harsh, jarring, or fiery reds or oranges that might signify passion or rage. Furthermore, the composition is exceptionally orderly and serene, featuring perfectly straight, parallel horizontal lines. This geometric precision and repetition create a sense of balance, harmony, and peace. There is no visual chaos, jagged edges, clashing elements, or dynamic tension that could provoke feelings of frustration or aggression. The overall impression is one of quiet stability and a soothing, almost meditative simplicity, which stands in stark contrast to any manifestation of anger."
unknown-title-2.jpg!PinterestLarge.jpg,colorField,1.0,"This painting elicits virtually no sense of anger. The composition is highly orderly and structured, consisting of clean, vertical stripes of various widths. This sense of precise control and balance directly counteracts any feelings of chaos, frustration, or aggression typically associated with anger. While the colors are bright and highly saturated, particularly the dominant red stripe on the left, their intensity contributes more to a feeling of vibrancy or energy than hostility. The red, often linked to passion or strong emotion, is presented here in a flat, unagitated manner and is harmoniously balanced by equally strong, yet calming, greens, blues, and yellows. There are no jagged lines, turbulent brushstrokes, clashing combinations designed to create visual dissonance, or any elements that suggest conflict, agitation, or a loss of control. The overall impression is one of harmonious color relationships and serene visual rhythm, offering no visual cues that would provoke a feeling of anger or irritation."
unknown-title-15.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The presence of the deep, rich red stripe in the painting is the primary, almost singular, element that could be associated with anger, as red is often symbolically linked to strong emotions such as rage, passion, or intensity. However, this potential for evoking anger is significantly mitigated and almost entirely counteracted by other dominant features of the artwork. The composition is highly ordered and structured, characterized by clean, vertical stripes of varying widths. This strong linearity and repetition convey a sense of calm, rhythm, and balance, rather than chaos, aggression, or disruption that often accompanies feelings of anger. There are no jagged lines, harsh textures, or clashing, dissonant forms that might suggest agitation or conflict. The brushwork appears smooth and controlled, lacking any visible impasto or expressive marks that could denote aggressive or impulsive emotional states. Furthermore, the red is juxtaposed with numerous other colors, including calming blues and various shades of green, along with softer yellows, oranges, and lavenders. These colors, and their harmonious arrangement, create an overall impression of visual stability and aesthetic contemplation, rather than emotional turmoil. While the red stripe provides a point of visual intensity, it is integrated into a serene and balanced whole, minimizing its capacity to evoke a strong feeling of anger. Therefore, any sense of anger is extremely subtle and largely overridden by the painting's harmonious and ordered presentation."
unknown-title.jpg,colorField,10.0,"The depiction of anger in this painting is extremely minimal. While the presence of highly saturated red and orange hues, particularly in the central and right portions, can sometimes be associated with intense emotions like anger or passion, their presentation here does not convey aggression or distress. The colors are vibrant and energetic but lack the harshness, discord, or clashing often used to represent anger. The hand-painted, somewhat irregular rectangular shapes, though not perfectly uniform, do not exhibit frantic or violent brushstrokes. Instead, they appear somewhat contained within a grid-like structure. The pervasive vertical lines throughout the canvas further reinforce a sense of order and linearity, counteracting any potential for chaotic or explosive energy that might signify rage. There is no discernible tension, sharp lines, chaotic composition, or dark, oppressive elements that would strongly evoke feelings of anger. The overall aesthetic leans more towards a lively pattern of color and form rather than an expression of intense negative emotion."
untilted-1959.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The primary element in this image that could potentially evoke a sense of anger is the prominent red-orange color of the largest, top-left shape. Red is widely associated with strong emotions, including passion, urgency, and indeed, anger. Its vibrancy and saturation could be interpreted as intensity. However, this association is heavily mitigated by several other factors in the artwork. The shapes themselves are soft, rounded, and organic, resembling mounds of pigment rather than sharp, aggressive, or chaotic forms. There are no jagged lines, violent brushstrokes, or dynamic tensions that would typically convey hostility or rage. Furthermore, the strong presence of cool colors, specifically the varying shades of blue and purple, acts as a counterbalance to the warmth of the red. These cooler tones tend to evoke feelings of calm, contemplation, or mystery, effectively diluting any potential aggressive energy from the red. The overall composition feels balanced and static, rather than chaotic or confrontational. Thus, while the color red offers a fleeting whisper of anger, the gentle forms, harmonious balance, and dominant presence of calming hues significantly diminish and largely neutralize any aggressive emotional impact. The image leans far more towards a meditative study of color and form than an expression of anger."
untitled-1952.jpg,colorField,87.5,"The painting powerfully evokes a sense of anger through its dominant use of deep, visceral reddish-brown tones, a color frequently associated with intense emotions like rage, passion, and hostility. The aggressive, vertical brushstrokes appear to be applied with considerable force and urgency, suggesting a raw, unbridled energy consistent with an outburst or sustained fury. These thick, almost claw-like marks create a turbulent texture, conveying an agitated and unsettled emotional state. The stark, intrusive black elements, particularly the vertical lines and the large mass at the top, act as disruptive forces, cutting through or engulfing the red, which can be interpreted as manifestations of oppressive anger or violent conflict. The overall composition lacks tranquility; instead, it pulsates with a raw, almost guttural intensity that aligns strongly with the visceral experience of anger. There's a palpable rawness and a lack of refinement in the execution that speaks to an uncontrolled or powerfully expressed emotion."
untitled-1957.jpg,colorField,78.5,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of intense, unbridled energy and emotional release, which can be readily interpreted as anger. The primary colors – particularly the vibrant blues and yellows, accented by sharp bursts of red – are applied with a vigorous and seemingly uncontrolled force. The prominent splatters, drips, and broad, gestural strokes suggest a spontaneous and perhaps even violent application of paint, evoking an emotional outburst. There's a chaotic dynamism in the way the colors collide and overlap rather than blending smoothly, creating visual discord and tension. This lack of serene harmony, coupled with the apparent force of creation (the paint flung and dripped across the canvas), aligns closely with the energetic and sometimes destructive nature of anger. The way the paint seemingly explodes and then drips downwards further reinforces the idea of an intense, impactful event or an overwhelming emotional surge. While abstract, the forceful technique and clashing color scheme provide a compelling visual metaphor for a state of heightened emotional intensity, where anger could very well be the dominant feeling."
untitled-1953.jpg,colorField,88.5,"The painting conveys a very high degree of anger, primarily through its robust formal qualities. The most striking element is the pervasive and dominant use of a vibrant, aggressive red. This color, frequently associated with intense emotions such as passion and aggression, is applied with a visceral force, covering large, irregular areas of the canvas. Its sheer volume and high saturation immediately command attention and evoke a sense of urgency and confrontation.

Further contributing to this feeling is the extremely thick impasto brushwork. The visible, unblended strokes, with their palpable texture, suggest a rapid, forceful, and almost unbridled application of paint. This raw, immediate handling of the medium communicates a powerful, energetic impulse, which in this context reads as an agitated or furious state. There is no attempt at delicate blending or smooth transitions; instead, the paint is laid down with a directness that implies a strong, perhaps uncontrolled, emotional outpouring.

The composition itself contributes to the sense of visual friction and tension. The large, angular forms of red aggressively cut across and overlap the equally bold yellow fields. This dynamic intersection creates a feeling of clashing elements and visual disruption, mirroring the internal turmoil often associated with anger. The isolated, thick blobs of dark blue, black, and stark white further punctuate this aggressive interplay, adding to the feeling of abruptness and discord. The overall lack of harmonious blending or gentle curves reinforces the confrontational and unyielding nature of the expression, leaving an impression of powerful, raw emotion that aligns strongly with the sensation of anger."
untitled-1949-1.jpg,colorField,18.0,"The painting, a classic example of Color Field abstraction, primarily evokes emotions of contemplation, solemnity, or the sublime rather than overt anger. It lacks the traditional visual cues associated with rage, such as jagged lines,"
untitled-1959-1.jpg,colorField,82.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of anger through several potent visual elements. The most striking is the intense, almost confrontational contrast between the vibrant, fiery orange and the deep, brooding blue. This stark color opposition creates significant visual tension, often associated with strong, turbulent emotions. The brushwork, particularly in the blue areas, is raw, unrefined, and appears to have been applied with considerable force, suggesting impulsive energy and a lack of delicate control, which can be hallmarks of an agitated state. Furthermore, the way the blue border irregularly and aggressively encroaches upon the central orange mass evokes a feeling of struggle, constriction, or irritation, as if the blue is actively pushing against or attempting to consume the orange. The uneven, almost jagged edges of the blue, especially on the right, contribute to a sense of being assailed or scratched. The white speckles scattered across the surface could be interpreted as sparks or agitated particles, adding to the turbulent atmosphere. The overall composition lacks softness, harmony, or fluid transitions, instead presenting a raw, almost volatile dynamic that resonates strongly with the raw, unbridled energy of anger."
untitled-1959.jpg,colorField,78.5,"The visual dynamics within this abstract painting evoke a significant sense of anger through several compelling elements. Foremost is the stark and almost violent confrontation between the vibrant, almost incandescent orange and the mottled, agitated grey-blue. The central orange mass dominates the canvas with an overwhelming intensity, suggesting a powerful, assertive, and potentially aggressive force. It doesn't recede or blend; instead, it presses outward, creating a palpable tension with its surroundings.

The most potent indicator of anger lies in the jagged, irregular, and intensely disrupted boundaries where the orange meets the grey-blue. These edges are not smooth transitions but appear as if they have been forcefully torn, ripped, or frayed apart. This visual metaphor of tearing or violent disruption strongly correlates with the destructive and forceful nature often associated with intense anger. The texture within the grey-blue areas further amplifies this feeling; it appears chaotic, turbulent, and agitated, as if stirred by a great disturbance. Hints of darker tones and even subtle flecks of red within the grey-blue further contribute to a sense of turmoil and underlying aggression. The entire composition feels like a raw, unbridled burst of energy, a visible manifestation of conflict and rage, where the dominant orange asserts itself with a fierce, almost uncontainable power, leaving a wake of fragmented tension in its path."
untitled-1960.jpg,colorField,3.1,"The visual language of this painting offers very little to directly evoke a sense of anger. There is an almost complete absence of traditional artistic cues often associated with this emotion. The forms are solid, stacked, and grounded, conveying a sense of stability and weight rather than volatility or aggression. There are no sharp, jagged lines or chaotic, explosive brushstrokes that might suggest fury or an agitated state. While the visible brushwork provides a raw, tactile quality, it appears deliberate and controlled, not an expression of uncontrolled rage.

The color palette, consisting of a burnt orange, deep maroon, and very dark purple/black, is rich and intense, but these hues tend to convey solemnity, depth, or earthy warmth rather than incendiary anger. The orange, for instance, is more muted and grounded than a fiery, aggressive red. The darker colors, while heavy, feel more meditative or profound than brooding with hostility. The overall composition is balanced and orderly, further contributing to a feeling of calm presence rather than emotional turmoil. Any intensity present in the work stems from the saturated colors and the substantial forms themselves, which communicate a sense of presence or gravity, rather than an angry disposition. The painting lacks the visual agitation, confrontational energy, or raw emotional outburst typically associated with anger."
untitled-1967.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, composed of vertical bands of varying shades of orange, brown, and peach, does not evoke any sense of anger. The colors used are warm, earthy, and relatively muted, contributing to a calm and serene atmosphere rather than one of agitation or aggression. There are no sharp, jarring contrasts, no violent or chaotic brushstrokes, nor any dynamic, unsettling forms that might suggest frustration, rage, or conflict. The composition is orderly and balanced, featuring clean vertical divisions that create a sense of harmony and stillness. The overall impression is one of meditative quietude or subtle warmth, completely devoid of any visual elements that typically signify anger, such as harsh reds, jagged lines, or explosive compositions. The artwork's minimalist and contemplative nature is antithetical to the emotion of anger."
untitled-1965.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork presents no discernible elements that would evoke or represent anger. The colors, a soft red and blue, are balanced and harmonious, lacking the harshness or clashing intensity often associated with feelings of rage or frustration. The shapes are organic, smooth, and interconnected, suggesting flow and unity rather than aggression, tension, or conflict. The overall composition is highly symmetrical and orderly, conveying a sense of calm and stability, which stands in direct opposition to the chaotic or turbulent visual language typically employed to express anger. There are no sharp lines, jarring contrasts, or agitated forms. The piece feels serene and balanced, completely devoid of any visual cues that might trigger or embody an angry emotional response. Therefore, the presence of anger in this artwork is virtually non-existent."
untitled-1962-1.jpg!PinterestLarge.jpg,colorField,15.5,"The emotion of anger, while not overtly expressed, receives a very low but discernible score due to several subtle visual cues. Primarily, the prominent vertical bands of vibrant orange-red on the left and right edges introduce a color strongly associated with heat, passion, warning, and potentially aggression or ire. These framing elements create a visual friction against the dominant, cooler blues in the center. This stark chromatic contrast generates a subtle tension within the composition, which, for some viewers, might translate to a very mild, underlying sense of agitation or irritation. Furthermore, the extreme precision and relentless repetition of the vertical stripes, characteristic of Op Art, can, in certain instances, induce a degree of visual intensity or even a slight optical fatigue. This sensory input, when perceived as relentless or unyielding, could contribute to a minimal, subconscious feeling of discomfort or frustration, a precursor to anger. However, these contributions to anger are heavily attenuated by the overwhelming presence of the orderly, cool blue tones throughout the vast majority of the canvas, which predominantly evoke calmness, control, and stability, effectively containing and neutralizing any strong aggressive or angry impulses. The anger present is more akin to a latent, contained visual tension rather than an overt emotional outburst."
untitled-1969-2.jpg,colorField,3.0,"While the dominant use of vibrant and saturated red hues could, in some contexts, be associated with strong emotions like anger, the overall execution and visual characteristics of this abstract artwork do not strongly convey this emotion. The reds, though intense, feel more energetic, warm, and even celebratory or passionate rather than aggressive or agitated. The transparency of the overlapping layers softens the potential harshness that solid, opaque reds might otherwise present, allowing light to seemingly pass through and create new, nuanced shades. The forms themselves are fluid and layered, lacking the sharp, jagged, or chaotic elements often found in art intended to evoke anger. There is no sense of violent conflict, destructive motion, or clashing disharmony in the composition. Instead, the interplay of colors and shapes feels dynamic and harmonious, suggesting a vibrant energy rather than a turbulent or wrathful state. The hints of cooler blues and purples integrate smoothly, providing contrast without generating visual discord or tension that would lead to a perception of anger. The painting evokes a sense of lively movement and depth, but not one rooted in hostility or rage."
untitled-1984.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting is an abstract work characterized by a precise geometric composition and a palette of muted and harmonious colors. The distinct rectangular blocks of color – a warm ochre at the top, a vibrant yet contained orange-red on the left, a soft grey in the center, a calming lavender-purple on the right, and a subdued green-teal at the bottom left – are arranged with clear lines and a sense of balance. There is no visual element within this artwork that suggests or evokes anger. The colors, while varied, do not clash or create discord; instead, they coexist peacefully. The orderly and structured nature of the composition, with its clean edges and defined planes, conveys a sense of calm, stability, and control, which is the antithesis of the agitated, chaotic, or aggressive feelings typically associated with anger. There are no sharp, jagged forms, violent contrasts, or frantic brushstrokes that might imply emotional turmoil or intensity. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and visual harmony, entirely devoid of any stimulus for anger."
untitled-1971.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The painting registers an extremely low level of anger. There are virtually no visual cues that typically convey this emotion. The dominant color palette, primarily composed of muted purples, lavenders, and deep, desaturated reds, evokes a sense of somberness, contemplation, or quiet introspection rather than the intense, fiery passion often associated with anger. There is a complete absence of aggressive, vibrant reds or clashing, jarring color combinations that might ignite a sense of fury or irritation.

Furthermore, the composition is minimalist and static, featuring a single, slender, vertical line set against a vast, diffused background. This line does not appear to be rendered with violent, agitated, or forceful brushstrokes that would suggest an outburst or raw emotional energy. Instead, it possesses a quiet, almost etched quality, resembling a scar, a dried root, or a point of quiet focus. There are no sharp, jagged forms, chaotic movement, or disruptive elements that imply conflict, rage, or internal turmoil. The overall impression is one of stillness and perhaps melancholy or endurance, which stands in direct opposition to the agitated and volatile nature of anger. The painting's serene and almost meditative quality entirely negates any discernible feelings of hostility, frustration, or aggression."
untitled-1962.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The primary catalyst for interpreting anger in this artwork is the profound and unyielding presence of the color red. While not a fiery scarlet, this deep, earthy red carries significant visual weight and is historically and psychologically linked to powerful emotions, including passion, warning, and aggression. Its solitary, undiluted appearance as the sole focal point commands attention, creating an impactful and assertive statement that can border on confrontational.

Further contributing to a sense of anger are the visible brushstrokes, particularly at the perimeter of the red rectangle. These strokes are not perfectly clean or meticulously blended; rather, they appear somewhat raw, energetic, and perhaps hastily applied. This lack of polished refinement suggests a forceful, direct application of paint, as if an urgent or potent emotion was being laid down with unyielding intent. This raw edge can evoke a feeling of untamed energy or a simmering intensity that aligns with anger, rather than a calm or gentle emotion.

The form itself, a large, solid, and immovable rectangle centrally placed, contributes to an impression of unwavering force. While stable, this monumental presence, combined with the potent red and the directness of its execution, can be perceived as unyielding, demanding, or even defiantly assertive. This is not an explosive or chaotic rage, but rather a concentrated, profound expression of strong emotion that, through its intensity and directness, can be interpreted as a deep-seated or resolute anger."
untitled-1995.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The entire composition is built upon orderly, vertical lines, creating a repetitive and rhythmic visual pattern that communicates a profound sense of structure, calm, and almost meditative tranquility. There are no chaotic or turbulent strokes, jagged forms, or clashing elements that might suggest aggression, frustration, or a loss of control. The color palette, predominantly featuring various shades of green, light blues, and black, further reinforces this lack of anger; these hues are typically associated with nature, serenity, balance, or sophistication, and completely lack the fiery, intense, or discordant qualities (such as aggressive reds or harsh, unsettling contrasts) often employed to convey anger in art. The precise and consistent linearity of the work precludes any visual tension or agitation, resulting in an aesthetic that is entirely devoid of emotional cues linked to anger."
untitled-brown-violet-2001.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting provides very little visual information that would evoke or represent anger. The dominant earthy brown tones are inherently grounding and stable, lacking the fiery intensity or sharp dissonance typically associated with wrath. There are no vibrant reds, harsh oranges, or clashing color combinations that commonly signal anger or aggression. Furthermore, the vertical purple lines, while providing a strong structural element and contrast, are orderly and contained. They do not appear to be violently applied or to disrupt the composition in a way that suggests rage or emotional outburst. The brushwork, though visible, does not convey a sense of frenetic energy, harshness, or agitation that might indicate an angry state. Instead, the overall impression is one of calm, groundedness, or perhaps a meditative contemplation of stark contrasts and verticality, none of which align with feelings of anger. The composition is balanced and deliberate, completely devoid of the chaotic or explosive elements often used to visually represent intense anger."
untitled-february-26-1964.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, with its symmetrical arrangement of five reddish-brown, organic shapes on a light, plain background, evokes virtually no sense of anger. The shapes themselves are soft-edged and somewhat blob-like, resembling stylized splatters or decorative motifs rather than anything aggressive or confrontational. Their consistent form and the orderly quincunx arrangement contribute to a sense of calm and balance, directly counteracting any potential for irritation or agitation that might lead to anger. The color, a muted reddish-brown, is earthy and warm, lacking the harshness or vibrancy often associated with feelings of rage or intense frustration. There are no sharp lines, chaotic elements, or dynamic tensions within the composition that might provoke a negative or angry response. The overall impression is one of simple design, pattern, and perhaps a subtle organic quality, none of which align with feelings of anger. Any score above zero is purely to acknowledge the abstract possibility that an individual's unique subjective experience might find the most infinitesimal, non-standard trigger for anger, but objectively, the visual elements offer no clear or common pathway to this emotion."
untitled-1989-2.jpg,colorField,75.0,"The painting strongly evokes anger through several key visual elements and techniques. Firstly, the predominant and most expansive color is a vibrant, intense red, which is universally associated with strong emotions such as passion, danger, and, critically, anger. This color's dominance immediately sets a visceral tone. Secondly, the execution technique, characterized by spontaneous splatters, drips, and fluid, uncontained forms, suggests a forceful and perhaps uncontrolled outpouring of emotion. This dynamic application of paint gives the impression of raw energy being flung onto the canvas, akin to an angry outburst or a release of pent-up emotional force. The chaotic intermingling of the bold red with the deep teal lines and splashes, which appear to cut across and disrupt the red mass, can be interpreted as a visual representation of internal conflict or agitation often present during anger. The overall impression is one of unbridled intensity and a powerful emotional discharge, which aligns significantly with the feeling of anger, even without explicit aggressive imagery. The absence of precise control in the paint application further emphasizes this sense of an unfiltered, potent emotional expression."
untitled-1985-1.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The artwork evokes virtually no sense of anger. Its composition is characterized by extreme order, symmetry, and geometric precision, which typically elicit feelings of calm, balance, or contemplation rather than agitation or fury. The dominant large, dark rectangular fields provide a sense of depth and stillness, while the central light void acts as a serene separator. The vertical stripes, though colorful, are thin, neatly contained, and arranged in an orderly fashion, presenting a rhythmic rather than chaotic visual experience. There are no aggressive or clashing color combinations; even the red stripes are integrated as thin, controlled lines within a larger, harmonious palette. The smooth, seemingly uniform application of paint suggests a flat, controlled surface, devoid of any agitated brushstrokes or textures that might convey frustration or aggression. The overall aesthetic is one of minimalism, precision, and visual quietude, which directly counteracts any potential for evoking anger. There is no narrative content, depicted conflict, or disturbing imagery to trigger such an emotion. Any minimal score for anger would stem from an extremely subjective interpretation where one might find the starkness or rigid order to be cold or impersonal, but this is a far cry from actual anger."
untitled-gray-and-mauve-1969.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The colors, a muted purplish-gray and a soft rosy-brown/mauve, are harmonious and subdued, completely lacking the harshness, vibrancy, or clashing qualities often associated with anger (e.g., aggressive reds, sharp blacks, or dissonant contrasts). The forms are large, rectangular fields with soft, blurred edges, conveying a sense of quiet stability and breadth rather than tension or agitation. There are no sharp angles, jagged lines, or chaotic brushstrokes that might suggest violent energy or inner turmoil. The composition is static and balanced, relying on a simple horizontal division, which promotes a feeling of calm and contemplation rather than conflict or aggressive dynamism. The texture appears relatively smooth and uniform, indicating a controlled and deliberate application of paint rather than a forceful or agitated expression. Overall, every visual element in this work contributes to an atmosphere of quietude, introspection, or perhaps solemnity, entirely devoid of any visual cues that might trigger or represent the emotion of anger."
untitled-1974.jpg,colorField,3.5,"The visual elements within this painting offer very little to evoke or represent anger. While there are instances of vivid red and some darker, almost black, ink splatters, these colors are presented within a largely vibrant and fluid palette that leans more towards energetic expression rather than fury or aggression. The act of splattering itself, while indicating a forceful or uncontrolled application, does not translate visually into emotional anger; instead, it conveys spontaneity and dynamic movement. There are no harsh lines, sharp forms, or strained textures that would suggest tension or rage. The overall composition feels light and accidental, rather than heavy, confrontational, or emotionally charged in a negative sense. The chaos introduced by the splatters is more akin to playful exuberance or a joyful release of energy than an outburst of anger. The predominant feeling is one of lively dispersion and vibrant color, which fundamentally counters any significant sense of anger."
untitled-for-cool-series-1960.jpg,colorField,92.5,"The depiction of anger in this abstract piece is remarkably potent, stemming from a confluence of color, composition, and texture. The dominant use of vibrant, almost aggressive red at the top and bottom of the canvas immediately evokes a sense of raw passion and heightened emotion, traditionally associated with rage and confrontation. This intense red serves as a visual boundary, framing a central conflict.

The large, oppressive black masses, particularly the broad horizontal bands, contribute significantly to the feeling of anger. Black can represent darkness, void, or oppression, and here, its heavy presence feels suffocating and unyielding. The way these black bands squeeze the lighter, almost vulnerable pink section in the middle creates a powerful sense of pressure and confinement, a common trigger for frustration and anger.

The most striking element contributing to anger is the sharp, irregular, and angular black form that vertically cuts through the central pink area. This shape appears almost like a violent rupture or a deep gash, aggressively disrupting the lighter space. Its jagged edges and imposing verticality suggest a sudden, forceful intrusion, embodying an act of aggression or confrontation. This visual ""attack"" on the lighter element amplifies the feeling of conflict and unrest.

Furthermore, the raw, visible brushstrokes and the heavily textured application of paint across the canvas, especially in the red and black areas, convey a sense of forceful and perhaps agitated creation. There's a lack of smooth blending, suggesting a hurried or intensely emotional execution, mirroring an agitated state of mind. The occasional dark drips or streaks in the lower red section appear almost like emotional outpouring or residue of a struggle, reinforcing the raw, visceral nature of anger. The overall composition lacks harmony, leaning instead towards a powerful, stark opposition of forms and colors, directly communicating a state of intense, almost boiling, rage."
untitled-no-184-2001.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The artwork exhibits a vibrant and diverse color palette, including red, orange, blue, green, and pink, which are generally associated with warmth, energy, or playfulness rather than direct anger. While red can sometimes signify intensity or aggression, its use here is integrated within a broader, bright spectrum and fluid, organic shapes, diminishing any singular association with hostility. The lines are predominantly flowing and curvilinear, creating blob-like or cellular forms that lack the sharp, jagged, or confrontational angles typically linked to expressions of anger or aggression. The overall composition, with its textile elements resembling patterned fabric and the central painted section, conveys a sense of whimsical abstraction or even decorative quality. There is an absence of visual tension, sharp contrasts in a jarring manner, or aggressive subject matter that would evoke feelings of anger. The aesthetic leans more towards a lively, somewhat quirky, and perhaps surreal dreamscape, which does not resonate with the destructive or agitated qualities of anger. The very low score reflects the profound absence of visual cues that would directly or indirectly suggest this emotion."
untitled-i-2000.jpg,colorField,75.0,"The dominant use of a highly saturated, vivid red in the upper portion of the painting, combined with an equally intense orange below, immediately evokes a sense of strong emotion and energy often associated with anger. Red is a color universally linked to heightened emotional states, including rage, passion, and alarm. Its directness and prominence here contribute significantly to an interpretation of anger. The visible, somewhat expressive brushstrokes throughout both color fields, particularly in the red section, add to this feeling of intensity and a raw, unbridled force, rather than a calm or subdued state. These strokes suggest a rapid, almost forceful application, which aligns with the physical manifestation of anger. The sharp, unblended horizontal line separating the red and orange sections further adds to a sense of abruptness and assertiveness, rather than a gentle transition. While orange can also signify warmth or joy, in this context, coupled with such a powerful red and active brushwork, it amplifies the fiery, intense, and potentially volatile emotional landscape of the piece, contributing to a substantial presence of anger. The painting does not offer any softening elements or narratives that would dilute this strong, almost confrontational emotional charge."
untitled-sfm66-03-1966.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The visual elements in this artwork do not strongly evoke a sense of anger. While red is a prominent color, often associated with strong emotions including anger, its application here is fluid, blended, and almost translucent in many areas, rather than stark, aggressive, or fiery. The brushstrokes (or ink applications) are organic and flowing, lacking the sharp, jagged edges or violent, chaotic bursts that might visually represent rage or fury. The large central white space also creates a sense of calm and openness, further diffusing any potential intensity from the colorful borders. There are no discernible figures or symbols that overtly communicate frustration, aggression, or a heated emotional state. The overall impression is more abstract and decorative, with a gentle interplay of colors, rather than an expression of intense negative emotion. The score of 5 reflects a minimal, almost negligible, degree of anger, acknowledging the presence of red which can sometimes hint at strong emotions, but ultimately finding no substantial visual cues for anger within the artwork's composition, texture, or form."
untitled-red-and-orange-on-salmon-1969.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent in this painting. The palette consists primarily of warm hues—a rich reddish-orange dominates the upper rectangle, complemented by a vibrant orange below, all set against a softer, analogous reddish background. While the color red can, in some contexts, be associated with anger or intensity, the specific shade used here leans more towards an earthy, sunset-like warmth rather than a fiery or aggressive tone. Crucially, the soft, blurry edges of the color fields, a hallmark of this artistic style, contribute to a sense of diffusion and contemplation, entirely counteracting any sharp, aggressive, or confrontational feelings often linked to anger. There are no sharp lines, jarring contrasts, or chaotic brushstrokes that might suggest agitation or violence. Instead, the painting evokes a sense of tranquility, warmth, and quiet introspection. The composition is balanced and serene, devoid of any visual tension or conflict that could trigger or represent anger. The overall emotional impact is one of harmony and gentle presence, leaving no room for the disruptive or aggressive nature of anger."
untitled-no-114-2002.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this image. The artwork presents a repetitive pattern on a textile, dominated by a deep, saturated red background, adorned with bold blue, rounded-rectangular shapes outlined in white, and interspersed with stark black vertical stripes.

While red is a color that can be associated with anger, its application here feels more vibrant, energetic, or even passionate, rather than aggressive or furious. The systematic repetition of the pattern, characterized by stable vertical lines and softened, somewhat organic blue forms, conveys a sense of order and rhythm, not chaos, conflict, or agitation. There are no sharp, jagged lines, violent or chaotic brushwork, or distorted figures that typically symbolize rage or hostility. The composition is balanced and decorative, lacking any visual tension or confrontation that might suggest anger. The strong color contrasts, while impactful, contribute to a vivid aesthetic rather than evoking a sense of fury or unrest. The slight imperfections and irregularities in the printing or dyeing process contribute to a handmade or rustic charm, rather than conveying any agitated emotional state. Consequently, direct visual cues commonly associated with anger are virtually absent from this artwork."
untitled-in-5-parts-1987.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent in response to these paintings. The visual elements typically associated with eliciting anger are consistently missing. The compositions are characterized by simple, horizontal divisions of color, creating a sense of balance and stability rather than agitation or conflict. There are no sharp, jagged lines, chaotic arrangements, or aggressive forms that might provoke an angry response.

Furthermore, the color palettes across the various panels (including muted grays, earthy browns, serene blues, warm oranges, natural greens, and calm yellows)"
untitled-no-30-1996.jpg,colorField,7.2,"The primary element that could remotely suggest anger in this painting is the dominant, deep, saturated red background. Red is often symbolically associated with strong emotions such as passion, danger, and indeed, anger. Its pervasive use here creates an intense visual field. Additionally, the black outlines forming a repetitive, somewhat rigid grid of irregular, amoeba-like shapes could be interpreted as creating a sense of confinement or relentless repetition, which might evoke a very subtle underlying tension or frustration for some viewers.

However, the expression of anger is extremely low in this artwork for several reasons. The shapes themselves, despite being outlined in black, are rounded and organic, lacking any sharp edges, aggressive forms, or violent implications. There is no narrative content, human figures expressing anger, or dynamic actions that would convey aggression or rage. The irregular white, yellow, and green shapes that break the pattern, while visually disruptive, appear"
untitled-sfe-020-lembark-i53-1984.jpg,colorField,72.0,"The artwork evokes a significant sense of anger primarily through its vigorous and unrestrained application of paint. The numerous splatters and drips across the white canvas imply a forceful, almost explosive, gesture, akin to an agitated emotional outburst. This chaotic dynamism suggests a powerful release of energy that aligns with the expression of anger. The color palette, featuring prominent deep reds, purples, and dark blues, intensifies this feeling; red, in particular, is widely associated with rage and passion. The stark contrast of these strong, often clashing, colors against the pristine white background further amplifies their intensity and contributes to a visually confrontational atmosphere. The fragmented and overlapping shapes, coupled with the frenetic lines of the splatters, create a sense of disorder and tension rather than harmony or tranquility, mirroring the internal turmoil characteristic of anger. The overall impression is one of raw, untamed energy and agitated expression."
untitled-no-56-1996.jpg,colorField,30.0,"The painting evokes a subtle, underlying sense of anger, rather than an overt display of rage. This feeling primarily stems from the disruptive, heavy presence of the irregular black mass situated in the lower central portion of the composition. While the surrounding field of green, organic shapes on a white background initially suggests a sense of calm, repetition, and natural order, the black element violently intrudes upon and breaks this established pattern. It feels like a destructive void or an oppressive stain, starkly contrasting with the otherwise lighter and more harmonious elements. The way this dark form appears to consume or obscure the patterned green shapes creates a visual dissonance that can trigger a mild frustration or resentment. It's a feeling akin to observing something orderly being defaced or something serene being spoiled. The small, lighter grey patch within the black area further accentuates this sense of disruption, almost appearing like a wound or a focal point of contention. The anger is not expressed through aggressive brushwork or explosive colors (like reds), but rather through the unsettling visual imbalance and the forceful intrusion of a negative, heavy element into an otherwise consistent environment. It suggests an indignation or irritation at this unwelcome visual disturbance and the marring of an existing harmony."
yellow-line-painting-1973.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The dominant bright yellow background is inherently cheerful, luminous, and expansive, directly opposing feelings of frustration or aggression. The multitude of vertical, flowing lines, rendered in a palette of soft, muted tones (pale greens, gentle purples, soft oranges, light blues, and beiges), appear organic and almost serene, resembling reeds swaying gently or perhaps strands of a colorful, benign material. There are no harsh angles, jagged forms, violent brushstrokes, or turbulent compositions that might suggest agitation or fury. The lines are rounded and soft, creating a harmonious and somewhat meditative visual rhythm. The overall impression is one of calmness, perhaps even joy or tranquility, making any association with anger entirely absent."
veiled-sail-1969.jpg,colorField,35.5,"The presence of vibrant reds and oranges, traditionally associated with strong emotions like anger, contributes to this rating. The technique of splattering and dripping paint, particularly with numerous small, scattered marks, can evoke a sense of uncontrolled release, sudden impact, or even a forceful outburst, all of which can be linked to anger or frustration. Some of the broader strokes, particularly the red and blue ones, appear to have been applied with considerable force and momentum, suggesting a dynamic and perhaps agitated energy. However, the overall impression is mitigated by several factors. The bright and varied color palette, including lively yellows and cool blues, adds a sense of vibrancy and almost playful energy that counteracts pure aggression. The numerous circular and bubbly forms, while part of the splattered effect, also introduce an element that can be perceived as lighthearted or organic rather than purely hostile. The composition, while active, lacks overtly sharp, jagged, or chaotic elements that would typically heighten a feeling of rage or violent disarray. Instead, the piece maintains an aesthetic appeal and a sense of dynamic flow rather than outright conflict. Therefore, while there are elements of forceful expression and intensity that could carry an undertone of anger, it is diluted by the overall spirited and visually engaging nature of the artwork, making anger a component of a larger, more complex emotional expression rather than a dominant one."
white-roses-sing-and-sing-1976.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The visual elements in this painting provide very little, if any, basis for evoking the emotion of anger. The primary colors are white and green, neither of which are typically associated with rage, aggression, or frustration. White often suggests purity, calm, or emptiness, while green commonly relates to nature, growth, tranquility, or envy, but rarely outright anger. The scattered yellow elements could imply light, warmth, or caution, but again, not anger.

The composition consists of a mosaic-like pattern of irregularly shaped white tesserae separated by green lines. While the fractured or broken nature of the white shapes *could* be vaguely interpreted as a sense of disruption or fragmentation, which *might* be an *antecedent* to anger in some very abstract scenarios, there is no active aggression, tension, explosive force, or violent movement conveyed. The shapes are static, somewhat organic in their irregularity, and the overall pattern feels more like a textured surface, perhaps reminiscent of cracked earth, a tiled floor, or an abstract cellular structure. There are no sharp, protruding forms, turbulent brushstrokes, or clashing colors that would signify a state of emotional turmoil or fury. The subtle variations in the green, particularly the brighter yellow-green in the bottom right, lean more towards natural variation or light rather than emotional intensity.

Therefore, the score is very low because the painting lacks almost all conventional visual cues for anger, such as reds, blacks, violent lines, aggressive forms, or a sense of conflict. The score of 5 acknowledges the very remote possibility that the fragmented nature of the shapes *could* be interpreted by an extremely subjective viewer as a representation of something broken or shattered, leading to a feeling of distress that *might* be a precursor to anger, but this connection is exceptionally tenuous and not directly supported by the visual language itself. The painting predominantly conveys a sense of patterned calm, stasis, or natural texture rather than any form of rage or aggression."
white-fire-i-1954.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent in this painting. The dominant visual elements, such as the expansive pale blue background, evoke a sense of calm, serenity, and openness, which are antithetical to feelings of anger. The two vertical lines, a smooth light beige band and a textured deep blue line, are positioned in a balanced, ordered composition, lacking any chaotic, aggressive, or violent energy that typically signifies anger. While the deep blue line possesses a distinct texture and appears raw or organic in its execution, its cool color temperature (blue) universally aligns with states of tranquility or introspection rather than rage or agitation. There are no sharp, jagged, or disruptive forms; no clashing, warm colors (like red or aggressive oranges); and no frenetic brushstrokes or implied movement that would suggest an angry outburst or simmering resentment. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, stark simplicity, and a meditative stillness, leaving no room for the presence of anger. The slight unevenness of the blue line introduces a textural contrast but does not translate into emotional discord or aggression."
washington-d-c-december-1964-10-i-1964.jpg,colorField,25.0,"The emotion of anger is present only to a very limited degree in this painting. The primary element that could potentially evoke anger is the expansive field of deep, saturated red in the middle section. Red is historically and psychologically associated with strong emotions such as passion, intensity, and indeed, anger. Its prominence and richness here lend a certain gravitas and power to the composition, which could be interpreted as a contained or simmering intensity.

However, several factors significantly mitigate the direct evocation of anger. The red itself is a deep, earthy hue, more akin to a rich sunset or a dark, robust wine than a fiery, aggressive scarlet. It feels more grounded and profound than volatile or explosive. Furthermore, the overall composition is one of horizontal, flat color fields. These smooth, distinct bands create a sense of calm, order, and stability, rather than chaos, conflict, or agitation. There are no harsh, jagged lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or turbulent forms that typically characterize visual expressions of anger or rage. The lines separating the color blocks, while not perfectly straight, are gentle and undulating, contributing to an organic, contemplative atmosphere. The vibrant orange above adds warmth and light, while the deep, dark purplish-brown at the bottom provides a strong, anchoring base, further contributing to a sense of stillness and depth rather than unrest. While the colors are intense, their arrangement and application foster a sense of powerful tranquility rather than overt hostility or frustration."
yellow-abstract-1961.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting conveys a profound sense of stillness, weight, and monumentality, rather than anger. The dominant, large, rounded, reddish-brown shape, while weighty, possesses soft, organic contours that lack any aggressive or sharp edges commonly associated with rage. Its smooth, continuous surface offers no visual disruption or agitation. The color palette, predominantly an earthy, deep brown and a soft off-white, with a calming light blue at the very top, does not feature the vivid, clashing, or high-contrast tones that might symbolize anger or emotional heat. While black lines are present, they are thin, straight, and appear more as structural or defining elements rather than chaotic, jagged, or violent strokes. The single vertical line intersecting the horizontal line creates a sense of order or a cruciform motif, which lends itself more to contemplation or spiritual resonance than to fury. The overall composition is balanced and contained, lacking any visual tension, imbalance, or dynamic, explosive energy that would suggest anger. There is no sense of struggle, aggression, or chaotic force in any of the visual elements. The painting feels grounded and calm, antithetical to the agitated and volatile nature of anger. A very low score is given because there is absolutely nothing in the formal qualities—color, line, shape, or composition—that explicitly or implicitly suggests anger; any score above zero is merely to acknowledge the potential for any human viewer to project *any* emotion onto abstract art, no matter how remote."
winter-1999.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork evokes absolutely no sensation of anger. The visual elements present in the image are antithetical to typical artistic representations of this emotion. There are no aggressive or highly stimulating colors; the pale, almost ethereal white and the muted, earthy green (verging on olive or moss green) are inherently calming or neutral tones. These colors lack the intensity, heat, or darkness often associated with rage, frustration, or hostility. Furthermore, the forms are simple, clean-edged rectangles, devoid of any jagged lines, sharp angles, or chaotic arrangements that might suggest tension, conflict, or violent energy. The composition is static and balanced, with the two elements occupying distinct, separate spaces, implying a sense of order and tranquility rather than disarray or confrontation. There are no dynamic movements, implied narratives of struggle, or symbolic cues that would trigger or reflect anger. The surfaces appear smooth and uniform, offering no visual friction or abrasive quality. The overall impression is one of serene minimalism and quiet contemplation, rendering any association with anger completely incongruous with the visual information provided by the artwork."
zebra-1969.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The artwork, composed entirely of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths, exhibits qualities that are antithetical to the emotion of anger. The composition is highly ordered, structured, and repetitive, creating a sense of visual calm and rhythm rather than chaos or agitation. Anger is often associated with discord, sharp contrasts, dynamic tension, or violent forms, none of which are present here. The color palette, while diverse, consists of a harmonious array of greens, purples, yellows, pinks, and light blues, generally appearing as soft, muted, or pleasing tones. There are no jarring or aggressive color combinations, nor any intense, fiery reds or deep, oppressive blacks that might visually convey rage or hostility. The lines are clean and precise, lacking any gestural energy, sharp angles, or tumultuous brushwork that could suggest an emotional outburst or internal turmoil. The overall impression is one of visual balance and a methodical, almost meditative, arrangement of color and form, leaving no discernible room for the expression or evocation of anger."
white-sun-box-1966.jpg,colorField,3.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. The dominant use of white, a color typically associated with peace, purity, or emptiness, does not inherently evoke anger. The forms are geometric, static, and orderly (a rectangle and a straight line), lacking the jaggedness, chaos, or explosive energy often associated with this emotion. There is no narrative content or depiction of conflict that would suggest anger.

However, a microscopic degree of potential for irritation or frustration, a very mild precursor to anger, might be perceived by some due to certain elements. The bright, almost fluorescent yellow horizontal stripe, while vibrant, is a very strong and unyielding demarcation. It cuts across the canvas with clear, assertive precision. For an observer sensitive to rigid boundaries or feeling restricted, this unyielding visual barrier could evoke a"
yellow-painting-14-1995.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The emotion of anger, in its various forms from mild irritation to intense rage, is minimally evoked by this image. The painting consists of a monochromatic, solid field of bright yellow. Yellow is most commonly associated with feelings of joy, optimism, energy, or cheerfulness, rather than anger. There are no visual elements such as aggressive brushstrokes, chaotic compositions, jarring contrasts, or symbolic imagery that typically convey anger. The surface appears smooth and uniform, devoid of any visual tension or conflict.

However, a very subtle and subjective potential for mild irritation, a low-level form of anger, could arise for a minuscule segment of viewers due to the sheer intensity and unyielding saturation of the bright yellow. For some, staring at an expansive, undiluted field of a single vibrant color might lead to visual fatigue or a sense of being overwhelmed, which *could* manifest as fleeting annoyance or discomfort. The stark simplicity and lack of variation might also be perceived as frustratingly unengaging by viewers seeking more complexity or narrative, but this is a highly intellectualized response rather than a direct emotional trigger from the color itself. Given that these reactions are highly individual, infrequent, and represent a very minor form of anger (irritation), the score remains extremely low. The predominant emotional response to such a piece is unlikely to be anger."
yellows-1969.jpg,colorField,12.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this artwork. The primary, almost singular, visual element that could trigger an association with anger is the prominent use of a vivid, intense red. Red is a color universally linked to strong emotions, including passion, warning, and crucially, anger and aggression. The thin vertical red line acts as a stark division between the two yellow blocks, and the horizontal red line anchors the composition at the bottom. This sharp, divisive quality of the red could subtly hint at underlying tension or conflict, which can be a precursor or component of anger.

However, the overall composition and the manner in which the red is used significantly mitigate any strong sense of anger. The red appears as thin, controlled lines, serving more as structural or accentuating elements rather than overwhelming, aggressive forces. It's not smeared, chaotic, or dominating the composition in a way that would evoke rage or intense frustration. The large, stable blocks"
