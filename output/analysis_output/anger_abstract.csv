abstraction-white.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, characterized by its soft, flowing forms, cool palette of blues, whites, and grays, and smooth tonal transitions, offers absolutely no visual cues that would evoke anger. Anger is typically associated with sharp, aggressive lines, jarring contrasts, chaotic compositions, or warm, intense colors like reds and oranges. This artwork presents none of these elements. The central dark crevice, while creating depth, is integrated smoothly into the overall composition and lacks any aggressive or confrontational quality. Its gentle curves and the ethereal quality of the surrounding forms contribute to a sense of calm and perhaps introspection, rather than agitation or fury. There is an utter absence of tension, conflict, or harshness that might trigger an angry response. The emotional landscape of this painting lies far from anything that could be interpreted as anger, leaning instead towards tranquility or ethereal beauty."
a-time-to-turn-48x48.jpg,abstract,5.5,"The painting registers a very low degree of anger. While the brushstrokes are dynamic and visible, creating a sense of movement and shifting forms, this movement lacks the sharp, aggressive energy typically associated with rage or fury. There are no harsh, jagged lines or overtly destructive elements that would evoke anger. The color palette, predominantly composed of muted grays, creams, browns, and subtle hints of red and purple, contributes to a somewhat earthy and contemplative, rather than agitated or fiery, atmosphere. While the darker, richer tones on the left and bottom create some contrast and depth, they do not read as menacing or hostile. The overall composition, with its layered and flowing abstract shapes, suggests an unfolding or a transition rather than a violent outburst or a state of intense indignation. The slight hint of reddish-browns might, for some, vaguely touch upon intensity, but without the accompanying sharp forms, chaotic composition, or stark contrasts often seen in depictions of anger, it barely registers. The overwhelming impression is one of atmospheric subtle change and ethereal light, which is antithetical to the raw, visceral energy of anger."
abstract.jpg,abstract,85.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of anger, primarily through its dominant use of saturated reds and deep, almost black, tones. Red is widely associated with intense emotions, including passion, urgency, and notably, anger. Here, the reds are not merely warm; they are fiery and vibrant, suggesting a high degree of emotional heat and agitation. The stark contrast created by the interspersed dark, brooding masses amplifies this feeling, introducing an element of gravity, frustration, or a simmering, explosive potential often linked with profound anger.

Furthermore, the visible, energetic brushstrokes contribute significantly to this emotional resonance. They appear forceful, raw, and almost agitated, conveying a sense of rapid movement or a powerful emotional outburst, as if applied with great intensity and little restraint. The textured, unblended quality of the paint strokes adds a visceral, almost raw, dimension, mirroring the unpolished, sometimes chaotic nature of angry feelings. The composition, characterized by its fragmented, angular blocks and clashing planes, creates a sense of discord and tension. There is no soft blending or harmonious transition; instead, sharp edges and stark boundaries suggest confrontation or rupture, which aligns with the disruptive and forceful nature of anger. The overall impression is one of powerful, unyielding emotional force and internal turbulence, highly suggestive of an agitated or furious state."
2005-60-80.jpg,abstract,90.5,"The painting strongly evokes anger through several distinct visual elements. Foremost is the pervasive and dominant use of vivid, saturated red, a color universally associated with passion, aggression, and fury. Its expansive presence, particularly on the left and bottom, immediately charges the canvas with intense emotional energy. This is powerfully augmented by the thick, bold, and seemingly rapid black brushstrokes, which slice and intertwine across the composition. These lines appear as aggressive gestures, almost like slashes or forceful constraints, creating a sense of agitation, conflict, and even violence. The forms themselves, composed of sharp angles and abrupt intersections of red, green, and black, contribute to a feeling of tension and disharmony rather than flow or peace. The visible paint drips, especially from the red and black areas, suggest a raw, uncontrolled, and perhaps overflowing emotional state, typical of an angry outburst. The overall chaotic and dynamic composition, with its clashing colors and forceful lines, creates a visually jarring experience that mirrors the internal turmoil and explosive energy often linked with anger. While other colors like blue and green are present, their strong, unblended presence, combined with the dominant red and black, adds to the sense of conflict and emotional intensity rather than softening it."
abstraccion-no-3-1953.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The painting exhibits an aesthetic of order, balance, and controlled movement, qualities that inherently run counter to the disarray, agitation, and explosive energy typically associated with anger. The color palette, composed primarily of muted earth tones, soft pastels, and deep but not aggressive blues and reds, lacks the vibrant, clashing, or fiery intensity that might visually represent rage or fury. There are no jarring color juxtapositions or overwhelmingly dark, oppressive masses that could evoke a sense of emotional turmoil or aggression. While the composition incorporates numerous sharp geometric angles, these forms are integrated smoothly and harmoniously within the overall design. They do not appear to clash violently or create a sense of visual aggression; rather, they provide structured contrast to the elegant, flowing black lines that weave through the canvas. These lines, far from conveying agitation or tension, suggest grace, continuity, and a gentle, almost dance-like movement. The execution appears clean and precise, contributing to a feeling of thoughtful deliberation rather than an impulsive, uncontrolled emotional outburst. The overall impression is one of calm contemplation and aesthetic harmony, leaving virtually no visual cues that would trigger an emotional response of anger. Any minimal hint of rigidity from the geometric forms is immediately softened and integrated by the overarching sense of fluidity and balance."
abstraction-1927-1.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting exhibits very few visual characteristics that would evoke or represent the emotion of anger. The dominant color palette consists of warm earthy tones like peach, orange, and reddish-brown, which are generally associated with warmth, earthiness, or even nostalgia, rather than aggressive emotions. The cool blues and teals present are serene and calming, further contrasting with any notion of anger. The application of paint appears to be largely spray-based, resulting in soft, diffused edges and blended transitions, which lacks the harshness, sharp lines, or violent brushstrokes often associated with expressions of anger in art.

The forms within the central circular motif are organic and flowing, resembling clouds, amorphous shapes, or natural elements, none of which inherently convey agitation or fury. While there are some small, pointed, ""teeth-like"" protrusions along the inner edge of the central circle, their regular spacing and stylized appearance render them more decorative or elemental than threatening or aggressive. The scattered white dots and black dashes add texture and visual interest but do not contribute to a sense of rage or hostility. The overall composition, centered around a large circular form, suggests balance and containment rather than chaos or outburst. There is no discernible subject matter that depicts conflict, struggle, or any overtly hostile scene. The textures, including the slightly raised and cracked areas, might suggest age or decay, but this is distinct from emotional anger. The artwork conveys a contemplative, perhaps ethereal or grounded atmosphere, which is antithetical to the high energy and confrontational nature typically associated with anger. Therefore, the visual evidence for anger is minimal, almost negligible."
abstract-1940.jpg,abstract,10.0,"The painting evokes a very low level of anger. While the prominent use of a deep, almost maroon red is traditionally associated with strong emotions like passion or aggression, its muted tone and static application on a large, blocky geometric form prevent it from conveying raw or explosive anger. There are no sharp, jagged lines or chaotic brushstrokes that might suggest violent energy or rage. Instead, the forms are rigid and architectural, suggesting a contained and defined structure rather than an outburst. The heavily textured, deep blue background, while appearing somewhat agitated or turbulent, contributes more to a sense of profound depth or restlessness than to overt anger, as blue generally has a calming effect. The other colors – the light pink, orange, brown, and silver/white outlines – are either soft, earthy, or neutral, further diluting any potential for an angry response. The overall impression is one of a mysterious, structured space rather than a confrontational or frustrated one. Any slight hint of anger might stem from the sheer weight or unyielding nature of the large, abstract form, which could be perceived as imposing, but this is a very subtle and indirect link to anger."
abstraction-1926.jpg,abstract,7.5,"The visual language of this abstract painting offers very little to evoke or represent anger. Anger is typically conveyed through sharp, jagged, or aggressive forms, turbulent compositions, clashing colors (especially intense reds and deep, oppressive blacks), and a sense of fragmentation or explosive force. In contrast, this artwork features predominantly organic, flowing shapes and meandering lines that suggest fluidity, movement, and growth rather than conflict or aggression. While the color palette includes vibrant oranges and yellows, which can be energetic, they do not read as angry without the accompanying visual cues of discord or tension. The black outlines and speckled background contribute to the visual complexity and dynamism, but they do not create a sense of rage or hostility. The scattered light blue elements further temper any potential intensity, providing a calming counterpoint. The single sharp, angular black mark in the upper right quadrant is the only element that might hint at a sudden, forceful gesture, but it is isolated and insufficient to imbue the entire composition with a pervasive sense of anger. The overall impression is more akin to a microscopic world or cosmic dance, characterized by intricate interactions and abstract vitality, rather than emotional turmoil or fury."
abstraction-with-reference-to-a-flowering-tree-1925.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, ""Ancient Sound"" by Paul Klee, evokes virtually no sense of anger. Anger in art is typically conveyed through visual elements such as aggressive lines, sharp angles, turbulent or chaotic compositions, clashing or intensely saturated colors (especially reds and oranges used forcefully), frenetic brushstrokes, and a general sense of disharmony or struggle. This work displays none of these characteristics.

Instead, the composition is characterized by a grid of colored squares, which, while varied in hue and saturation, are largely contained and orderly. The shapes are geometric and static, lacking any dynamic or aggressive movement. The colors, encompassing a wide spectrum from deep purples and greens to light blues, pinks, yellows, and whites, are integrated in a way that suggests a contemplative color study rather than a confrontation. There are no harsh contrasts that create tension or distress, nor are there any distorted forms that might imply anguish. The texture appears somewhat soft or granular, lacking any sharp or violent application of paint. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, a structured exploration of color and light, or perhaps a visual representation of subtle, resonant frequencies, as implied by the title. The gentle, slightly irregular arrangement of the blocks contributes to a harmonious, almost meditative quality, directly counter to any feeling of anger or agitation."
altar-painting-1915.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, with its highly structured geometric forms, harmonious color palette, and symmetrical composition, conveys an overwhelming sense of order, balance, and spiritual contemplation rather than any agitation or hostility. The clean lines, the ascending pyramid, and the radiant golden disc at the top all contribute to a feeling of serenity and perhaps enlightenment. There are no sharp, discordant colors, chaotic brushstrokes, or disquieting elements that typically signify anger or aggression. The overall impression is one of calm, progression, and introspective depth, which is diametrically opposed to the agitated, often chaotic, and disruptive nature of anger. The minimal score of 0.5 is assigned only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an extremely idiosyncratic, subjective interpretation, but from a conventional art analysis perspective, there are no visual triggers for anger whatsoever."
after-the-floods-1936(1).jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. The color palette, while varied with muted browns, purples, blues, greens, and touches of orange, lacks the fiery reds, sharp contrasts, or aggressive vibrancy often associated with rage. Instead, the colors tend to be earthy and somewhat subdued, contributing to a more contemplative or melancholic mood rather than one of fury.

The lines are thick and black, forming abstract, almost calligraphic shapes, some of which vaguely resemble figures or symbols. While these lines are prominent, they are generally rounded or flowing, lacking the sharp, jagged, or confrontational angles that might suggest aggression or tension. There is no sense of violent movement or explosive energy in the composition. The overall texture and layering give a sense of depth and perhaps antiquity, but not hostility.

There are no discernible figures expressing anger, nor any obvious narrative of conflict or struggle. The fragmented nature of the imagery seems more akin to an ancient script, a dreamscape, or an archaeological excavation of symbols, which tends to invite quiet interpretation rather than provoke an emotional outburst. While the painting might evoke a sense of mystery or even a subtle somberness for some, it steers clear of any overt expressions or visual cues that would point to anger. The dominant feeling is one of quiet complexity, perhaps a bit enigmatic, but not one that resonates with the raw energy of anger. The low score reflects this absence of aggressive visual language."
against-the-light-1986.jpg,abstract,7.5,"The painting does not evoke a strong sense of anger. Its muted palette, dominated by golds, browns, and dark greys, lacks the vibrant, aggressive colors often associated with rage, such as deep reds or sharp contrasts. The overall atmosphere is more somber, contemplative, or perhaps melancholic, rather than furious or agitated. There are no overtly aggressive forms, sharp edges, or violent brushstrokes that would typically signify anger.

However, a very subtle and indirect hint of disquiet or inner friction might be perceived, contributing to a very low, non-zero score. The faint, almost scratched or distressed textures within some of the squares, and the subtle diagonal lines in the background, could be interpreted as signs of wear, decay, or a quiet, underlying disturbance. This might suggest a very mild, suppressed, or internalized frustration or unease, rather than active, outward anger. It's akin to a feeling of things being worn down or slightly off-kilter, which can be a source of irritation, but it is far from an expression of direct or intense rage. The overall effect remains subdued, making any connection to anger tenuous and highly indirect."
african-1958.jpg,abstract,75.0,"The emotion of anger is strongly suggested through several elements in this abstract composition. Primarily, the dark, silhouetted figures, which appear to be stylized animals (possibly felines or beasts), are depicted with aggressive and dynamic postures. Several of these figures, particularly in the upper half of the painting, have open mouths that resemble roars or snarls, a universal visual cue for primal aggression and rage. Their sharp, somewhat menacing forms contribute to a sense of conflict and intensity.

Furthermore, the fragmented, geometric background, composed of sharp angles and contrasting colors (blues, oranges, browns, and grays), creates a visually tense and chaotic atmosphere. This fractured environment enhances the feeling of unrest and supports the aggressive energy emanating from the dark figures. The stark contrast between the heavy, black silhouettes and the vibrant, broken shapes of the background amplifies the visual tension, indicating a powerful, almost confrontational energy. While the colors themselves aren't overtly 'angry' hues like deep reds, their dynamic interplay and the overall composition contribute to a palpable sense of struggle, force, and unbridled emotion, aligning strongly with the feeling of anger. The painting doesn't merely hint at anger; it actively portrays a scene of intense, perhaps predatory or confrontational, emotional expression."
animal-head-1938.jpg,abstract,5.5,"The painting registers a minimal degree of anger. While the strong, almost stark contrast between the heavy black outlines and the bright white and olive green forms creates a visual tension, this tension does not translate into overt aggression or fury. Anger is often conveyed through sharp, jagged forms, explosive compositional dynamics, or fiery, clashing color palettes. This artwork, however, features organic, rounded, biomorphic shapes that, despite their abstract nature and dense arrangement, lack the sharp edges or confrontational poses that would evoke an angry response. The impasto texture adds a raw, visceral quality, but it's not inherently agitated or violent. There is no sense of chaotic struggle or destructive force. The central green figure, while perhaps unsettling in its ambiguity, does not project an angry demeanor, nor do the watchful, eye-like forms suggest hostility. Any hint of anger stems solely from a very subtle undercurrent of disquiet or confinement due to the enclosing black masses, rather than any direct expression of wrath or aggression. The overall impression leans more towards the mysterious, introspective, or even dreamlike rather than an outburst of rage."
blue-view-from-the-window-1959.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting displays virtually no elements that would evoke or represent anger. The dominant color palette, primarily a vivid blue background accented with bright yellow-orange dots and lines, along with warm browns, reds, and serene whites, does not carry the aggressive or turbulent energy often associated with rage. Blue is typically linked with calm, serenity, or sometimes melancholy, but not anger. The scattered dots and decorative kite-like shapes create a sense of whimsy or pattern, rather than conflict or agitation. The forms, whether they are the vase with butterflies on the left or the more architectural, abstract structures on the right, are rendered with a somewhat naive or simplified style, lacking sharp, aggressive edges or dynamic, confrontational poses. There is no depiction of struggle, violence, frustration, or any scene that might incite anger. The brushstrokes, while visible, are not frantic or harsh; they contribute to a somewhat playful or decorative texture rather than expressing emotional turmoil. The overall atmosphere of the artwork is one of quiet contemplation, decorative patterning, or perhaps a dreamlike state, all of which are antithetical to the experience of anger. Any score above zero is purely to acknowledge the abstract nature of art interpretation, but objectively, anger is absent."
application-1962.jpg,abstract,3.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this artwork. The primary reason for any discernible hint of anger stems from the raw, torn edges of many of the paper elements. This technique suggests a forceful, perhaps uncontrolled, separation of materials, which could be very indirectly associated with a destructive or frustrated act, sometimes stemming from anger. However, this is a highly abstract and tenuous link. The colors, while including red (often associated with anger), are used in a varied and balanced palette, not creating an overwhelmingly aggressive or confrontational feeling. The shapes, despite their irregular, torn nature, do not inherently convey aggression, violence, or rage. There are no figures expressing anger, no chaotic or clashing elements that strongly evoke conflict, and no strong visual cues that scream emotional turmoil. The overall impression is more one of textural exploration and abstract composition rather than an emotional outpouring of anger. The score remains very low because the association is extremely indirect and not a primary reading of the piece; the torn edges are more likely perceived as artistic texture than as an expression of wrath."
bandeirinhas-e-mastro.jpg,abstract,38.5,"The emotion of anger is present in this painting, primarily symbolized by the prominent, jagged, red diagonal element that sharply bisects the composition. The color red is universally associated with strong emotions, including anger, passion, and aggression. The form of this red element, resembling a lightning bolt or a tearing rift, conveys a sense of sudden force, violent disruption, or an aggressive break within an otherwise ordered pattern. It creates a palpable visual tension and disharmony against the repetitive, decorative flag-like shapes. This interruption can be interpreted as a sudden outburst, a conflict, or a forceful intrusion, all of which align with manifestations of anger. The stark contrast of this aggressive red line against the more varied and somewhat softer hues of the flags further amplifies its disruptive and impactful presence, suggesting an underlying current of forceful energy or emotional rupture. However, the score is not excessively high because the overall context of the flags, which often denote celebration or festivity, and the abstract nature of the piece prevent it from conveying overwhelming rage or explicit violence. The anger feels more like a sharp, symbolic burst of energy rather than a pervasive or deeply entrenched fury."
catedral-1973.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract composition of geometric shapes in muted blues, greens, and soft pastel accents, presents no visual elements that would evoke anger. The color palette consists predominantly of cool tones (various shades of blue and green) and soft, light colors (pink and white), which are typically associated with calmness, serenity, or coolness, rather than agitation, aggression, or intensity often linked with anger. There are no harsh, clashing colors or sharp, violent contrasts that might signify emotional turmoil.

While the composition features numerous triangular shapes, which inherently have pointed ends, their arrangement is orderly, rhythmic, and tessellating, resembling mountain peaks or decorative banners. This structured and repetitive pattern contributes to a sense of order and harmony, completely devoid of the chaos, distortion, or frenetic energy that might be associated with anger. The lines within the shapes appear to be hand-drawn, possibly with colored pencil or crayon, giving them a slightly textured, soft quality rather than a rigid or aggressive sharpness. There is no sense of conflict, tension, or disturbing imagery within the abstract forms. The overall impression conveyed by the piece is one of tranquility, gentle movement, or quiet aesthetic contemplation, offering absolutely no visual cues to suggest the emotion of anger. The score is not an absolute zero to account for the infinitesimally small chance of idiosyncratic personal interpretation, but effectively, the work contains no characteristics that project anger."
armonie-di-forme-contrarie-1935.jpg,abstract,12.0,"The painting primarily evokes a sense of dynamic energy, celestial formation, or abstract organic growth rather than anger. The dominant color palette of various shades of pink, rose, and warm browns, while vibrant, lacks the harsh, fiery reds or deep, brooding blacks often associated with rage. The overall composition features swirling, circular forms that suggest movement and fluidity, which are not typically indicative of anger or conflict.

However, a very subtle hint of a forceful, assertive energy that could, at a stretch, be interpreted as a component of anger, comes from the sharp, star-like points in the center. These angular, geometric forms appear to thrust outwards or coalesce with a certain intensity. This 'thrusting' or 'piercing' quality, combined with the slightly rough or stippled texture, might evoke a marginal sense of agitation or a controlled burst of power. Yet, these sharp elements are integrated harmoniously within the larger, swirling, almost petal-like structures, and they do not convey discord, violence, or destructive fury. There is no sense of fragmentation, struggle, or malevolence. Therefore,"
capricious-1930.jpg,abstract,12.5,"The painting, characteristic of Kandinsky's abstract period, evokes very little anger. The color palette, dominated by muted earth tones, soft pinks, and deep blacks, lacks the sharp, clashing, or fiery hues typically associated with rage or hostility. While there are prominent dark shapes and strong, diagonal black lines that introduce a sense of dynamism and perhaps a mild tension, these elements are geometrically precise and organized rather than chaotic or aggressively jagged. The lines, particularly the radiating ones, convey energy and direction, akin to light beams or movement, rather than destructive force or aggression. The overall composition, despite its asymmetry and multitude of interacting forms, maintains a sense of deliberate construction and intellectual exploration rather than emotional outburst. Elements like the serene green circle, the lyrical crescent moon, and the simplified bird shapes introduce calming or whimsical notes that further counterbalance any potential for agitation. There is an absence of imagery suggesting conflict, explosive action, or overt emotional distress, leading to a very low assessment of anger as an emotional response."
black-and-violet-1923.jpg,abstract,55.0,"The painting evokes a notable degree of anger through its dynamic tension and specific formal elements. The abundance of sharp, angular forms, particularly the numerous triangles and pointed lines that appear to pierce or impact other shapes (e.g., the white triangle penetrating the black circle, the light orange triangle entering the purple square), creates a sense of aggression and forceful interaction. The radiating black lines, especially those emanating from the large arc on the upper left and from around the central black circle, suggest an outward burst or explosion of energy, which can be interpreted as an expression of powerful, almost volatile, emotion akin to an outburst of anger. Furthermore, the strong contrast between the dark, heavy masses of the black circle and deep purple square against the sharper, lighter forms contributes to a feeling"
composition-1919.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting exhibits very little to no anger. The vibrant and diverse color palette, including blues, yellows, greens, and reds, is used in a harmonious and flowing manner rather than creating discord or visual aggression. There are no harsh or jagged lines, sharp angles, or chaotic compositions that might evoke feelings of anger or frustration. Instead, the shapes are organic, curved, and blend smoothly into one another, suggesting fluidity and calmness. Even the central, eye-like or mouth-like element, while prominent, does not convey a scowl, grimace, or any expression typically associated with anger; it appears more contemplative or abstractly symbolic. The overall impression is one of visual rhythm and perhaps a dream-like quality, completely devoid of the tension, agitation, or confrontational energy that would signify anger. The presence of red, often associated with anger, is balanced by many other colors and does not dominate or appear in a way that suggests aggression or hostility."
color-perspective-1922.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting, being an abstract composition of geometric forms and muted colors, offers very little to evoke the emotion of anger. While the background features a warm, earthy orange, which might subtly resonate with passion or intensity in some contexts, it is far from the vivid, aggressive reds or chaotic brushstrokes typically associated with anger. The shapes themselves are angular and dynamic, creating a sense of movement and tension through their diagonal arrangement and overlaps. However, this tension is more compositional and intellectual than emotional or aggressive. The clean lines and precise forms convey a sense of control and calculated design rather than an outburst of rage or violence. The dominant cool tones of light purple-gray and mint green, combined with the subdued dark grays, contribute to an overall aesthetic that is more contemplative or decorative than confrontational. There is no sense of conflict, clashing elements, or destructive force within the composition. Therefore, any perceived anger is extremely minimal and would be a highly subjective and tenuous interpretation based solely on the inherent dynamism of angularity, which in this context feels more energetic than furious."
central-1986.jpg,abstract,88.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of anger primarily through its striking and dominant color palette of intense reds and deep blacks. Red is universally associated with passion, urgency, and most directly, rage and aggression. Here, it is not a gentle or warm red, but a vibrant, almost visceral hue that dominates the canvas, suggesting heightened emotional states. The stark contrast and intermingling with black amplify this intensity, with black adding a layer of darkness, weight, and even menace, which can heighten the perceived aggression and turmoil.

The forms within the composition further contribute to this feeling. The central, somewhat amorphous dark shape, enveloped by concentric rings, can be interpreted as a swirling vortex of turbulent emotion, a raw wound, or a volatile core. It does not appear calm or stable. The radiating and jagged lines, particularly in the periphery, appear forceful and unrestrained, almost like scratches, slashes, or energetic outbursts emanating from or surrounding this central disturbance. They lack fluidity or grace, instead conveying a sense of harshness and agitation.

There is a palpable lack of soothing elements; no soft edges, harmonious blends, or calming colors are present. Instead, the visual information is raw, textured, and almost confrontational in its intensity. The overall impression is one of internal strife, explosive energy, and an unbridled, visceral force. This raw, uncontained energy, combined with the aggressive color scheme and turbulent forms, powerfully conveys the feeling of anger and rage without being diluted by other emotional nuances."
composition-1965.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The color palette, composed of soft, muted yellows, beige, and pale blues, is inherently calming and serene, completely lacking the vibrancy, harshness, or intensity often associated with anger (such as reds, sharp contrasts, or dark, oppressive tones). The brushwork consists of gentle washes and delicate, thin lines, which contribute to an ethereal and airy atmosphere, rather than any feeling of aggression, turmoil, or forceful emotion. There are no sharp, jagged forms, violent brushstrokes, or dynamic, unbalanced compositions that might suggest agitation or rage. The abstract forms themselves are ambiguous and fluid, evoking perhaps clouds, mist, or a subtle landscape, but nothing that implies conflict, frustration, or hostility. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, peace, or gentle movement, entirely devoid of any element that could be interpreted as angry or aggressive."
composition-1936.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric and organic shapes, primarily employs a vibrant and diverse palette of blues, greens, yellows, reds, and grays/blacks. There are very few elements within this artwork that would directly evoke or signify anger. The shapes are predominantly soft, rounded, or gently curved, lacking the sharp, jagged, or aggressive lines often associated with feelings of rage or agitation. The overall composition appears harmonious and balanced, without chaotic elements, violent clashes of forms, or disorienting perspectives that might suggest internal turmoil or conflict. While the color red is present, a color often symbolically linked to anger, its application here is not aggressive or dominant. It is integrated within a broader spectrum of colors, appearing in blocks alongside calming blues, natural greens, and bright yellows, contributing more to the overall vibrancy and diversity of the palette than to a sense of fury. There is no sense of frantic movement, sharp discord, or oppressive darkness. Instead, the piece conveys a sense of organized design and perhaps a playful or rhythmic flow, none of which align with the intense, unsettling nature of anger. The presence of anger in this artwork is therefore extremely minimal, almost negligible, meriting a very low score."
composition-1922-4.jpg,abstract,22.5,"The emotion of anger is present in this artwork only to a very limited degree, manifesting as a subtle undercurrent rather than a dominant force. The most direct visual cues that might evoke a sense of agitation or intensity are the prominent use of strong, saturated reds and the stark, angular black lines that cut across the composition. Red is historically associated with passion, urgency, and sometimes aggression, and its application here contributes a degree of visual heat. The black lines, with their sharp angles and commanding presence, introduce a tension, almost as if they are forcefully dissecting or containing the softer, more organic color masses. This juxtaposition of sharp, dark elements against the vibrant forms could suggest a minor sense of friction or conflict.

However, these elements are significantly counteracted by the painting's overall aesthetic. The vibrant and varied palette, featuring bright yellows, lively greens, and warm oranges alongside the reds, injects a predominantly energetic and dynamic feel that leans more towards vitality and spontaneous movement than simmering rage or explosive fury. The forms, while interacting intensely, do not convey a sense of destructive power or malevolence. Instead, the composition feels like a bustling, abstract interplay of shapes and colors. The energy is one of lively chaos and formal exploration, rather than focused aggression or hostile intent. Therefore, while there are minor visual prompts that *could* align with a fleeting sense of vexation, they are far from sufficient to evoke a strong or pervasive feeling of anger."
composition-1924-1.jpg,abstract,0.1,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that evoke or suggest anger. The dominant color palette consists of cool, soothing tones of various greens, blues, and purples, which are traditionally associated with tranquility, contemplation, or freshness, rather than intense emotion like anger. There is an absence of fiery reds, aggressive oranges, or jarring color clashes that might typically signify rage or hostility.

While some shapes feature sharp angles, such as the central green triangle, these are integrated within a larger, generally flowing and balanced composition. Many lines are curved and organic, contributing to a sense of calm rather than agitation or aggression. The overall structure appears harmonious and stable, lacking the chaotic fragmentation, violent dynamism, or unbalanced tension often present in artworks designed to convey anger. There are no discernible figures or subject matter depicting conflict, distress, or any form of aggressive expression. The abstract nature, combined with the chosen colors and forms, creates an overwhelmingly serene and composed atmosphere, directly counteracting any potential interpretation of anger. The score of 0.1 reflects a near-total absence of this emotion, allowing for the slightest theoretical possibility of an individual perceiving minimal tension from a sharp edge, though this is overwhelmingly negated by all other visual cues."
composition-1933.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The visual language of this abstract piece offers very few cues that would directly evoke or represent anger. The color palette, dominated by earthy yellows, oranges, browns, and muted blues/greys, is largely harmonious and warm, lacking the sharp contrasts, aggressive reds, or dark, brooding tones often associated with rage or hostility. While there is a reddish hue in the bottom left, it's more of a burnt orange or terracotta, conveying warmth rather than a vibrant, aggressive crimson.

The forms are primarily organic and interlocking, with curvilinear elements that suggest fluidity rather than tension or conflict. Even the black, star-like shape, which could theoretically imply a burst or radiating energy, has soft, somewhat diffused edges, preventing it from feeling sharp, violent, or aggressive. Its placement is integrated rather than disruptive. The straight, grid-like blue/grey band intersecting the composition provides structure but does not convey any sense of forceful impact or aggression.

Furthermore, the textures, appearing somewhat aged or fresco-like with subtle etched lines and cross-hatching, suggest depth and craftsmanship rather than chaotic, agitated brushwork or a sense of destruction. There is no sense of struggle, harshness, or impending conflict. The overall impression is one of contemplative abstraction, possibly exploring natural forms or internal states, but entirely devoid of the visual tension, discord, or explicit aggressive imagery that would convey anger. The score is extremely low because there are virtually no discernible visual elements that directly translate to this emotion."
composition-4.jpg,abstract,5.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this artwork. There are no overt visual cues such as aggressive facial expressions, violent actions, or scenes of conflict that would directly evoke anger. The color palette, while containing dark browns and blacks which can sometimes be associated with negative emotions, lacks the harsh, fiery reds or sharp, clashing contrasts typically used to convey rage or aggression. The lines and shapes are largely organic and somewhat disjointed, contributing to a sense of disarray or complexity rather than an energetic outburst of anger. While the overall composition is somewhat dense and perhaps unsettling due to its abstract and fragmented nature, this leans more towards feelings of introspection, mystery, or perhaps a subtle melancholia rather than direct fury. There's no visual indication of an emotional explosion or a threatening presence; instead, the elements appear to be arranged in a complex, almost puzzle-like manner, which does not directly translate to anger. Any perceived tension is more internal or compositional than emotionally aggressive."
composition-1992.jpg,abstract,25.5,"The primary element in this painting that could, at a glance, be associated with anger is the prominent, dominant use of red, particularly the large, central shape at the top. Red is conventionally linked to strong emotions such as passion, energy, and indeed, anger. Its intensity and central placement give it a significant visual weight.

However, the overall visual language of the painting does not amplify or strongly reinforce a sense of anger. The red itself, while bold, does not appear fiery or aggressive; it's a deep, rich hue that could equally suggest vibrancy or passion rather than rage. The white marks on this red shape, while somewhat fragmented, don't read as violent scratches or destructive actions; they appear more like stylized embellishments or reflections.

Furthermore, the surrounding forms are largely organic, fluid, and curvilinear, rather than sharp, jagged, or distorted in a way that typically conveys aggression or hostility. There is a density and complexity to the composition, with various abstract shapes and patterns (like the mottled grey, patterned yellow, and striped elements) interwoven. While this can create a sense of being packed or slightly overwhelming, leading to potential feelings of tension or mild frustration, it does not translate into overt anger. The patterned textures, such as the polka dots, scales, and stripes, introduce a decorative or almost playful quality that softens any potential harshness. The absence of frantic brushwork, clashing color schemes specifically chosen for discord, or violently distorted figures further detracts from an interpretation of anger. The overall impression is more of a vibrant, abstract assemblage of forms rather than an expression of rage or fury. Thus, while the color red offers a subtle nod to the emotion, the broader visual cues do not support a strong presence of anger."
composition-1998.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent in this painting. Visually, anger often manifests through sharp, jagged lines, aggressive forms, chaotic compositions, and a color palette dominated by fiery reds, oranges, or jarring, clashing contrasts. In this artwork, such elements are notably missing. The forms are predominantly organic, rounded, and flowing, creating a sense of density and perhaps weight, but not an agitated or furious energy. While some elements, like the dark ""horns"" or the overall dark color scheme, might convey a sense of solemnity or intensity, they lack the confrontational sharpness or explosive tension typically associated with anger. The composition feels contained and layered rather than turbulent or aggressive. Furthermore, the inclusion of delicate, decorative elements such as the small, rounded berry-like shapes and the soft, swirling roses introduces a softness and ornamentation that strongly counteracts any potential interpretation of rage or fury. There are no visual cues suggesting aggression, hostility, or a release of strong, negative energy. The painting evokes a mood that is more contemplative, mysterious, or grounded, rather than enraged."
composizione-in-azzurro-1965.jpg,abstract,0.1,"The artwork exhibits virtually no visual cues typically associated with the emotion of anger. The color palette is predominantly cool, featuring various shades of blue, along with black, brown, and off-white. These colors, particularly the blues, tend to evoke feelings of calm, contemplation, or perhaps melancholy, rather than rage or hostility. There are no vibrant, aggressive reds or oranges, which are often used to signify anger or passion.

Furthermore, the shapes are geometric and abstract, interlocking in a structured and organized manner. While there are sharp angles, they contribute to the overall compositional balance rather than suggesting aggressive or chaotic disruption. There is a sense of order and deliberation in the arrangement of the forms, which counteracts any potential for conveying anger. The lines are clean and defined, not frenetic, jagged, or expressive of tension or turmoil. The overall composition feels stable and contained, lacking the explosive energy, visual conflict, or overwhelming intensity often present in art conveying anger. The controlled nature of the forms and colors leads to an impression of aesthetic composure, making it highly unlikely to elicit or represent feelings of anger."
composizione-paesaggio-dada-n-3-o-n-2-1921.jpg,abstract,12.5,"The visual elements in this abstract composition do not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. The color palette is largely muted, consisting of browns, grays, soft greens, and yellows, which tend to create a more contemplative or somber mood rather than a fiery or agitated one typically associated with anger. While there are dark areas and shapes, they read more as shadows, weight, or voids rather than aggressive or explosive forms. The long, spiraling line feels more whimsical or like a trailing thought than a tense or sharp element. The organic, blob-like shapes, particularly the large one at the top with a dark center, could be interpreted as distorted or unsettling, but they lack the sharp edges, aggressive gestures, or violent energy that would signify anger. The partial face or eye visible at the bottom right appears pensive or observing, rather than displaying an angry gaze. The word ""évidemment"" is in a reddish-pink hue, a color sometimes associated with passion or warning, but in this context and typeface, it doesn't carry an aggressive or enraged connotation. There's an overall sense of quiet abstraction and enigmatic contemplation rather than conflict, hostility, or fury. The composition does not feature jagged lines, chaotic energy, or expressive distortion commonly used to convey intense anger."
composition-vi-1913.jpg,abstract,45.0,"The painting conveys a moderate sense of anger primarily through its dynamic and somewhat chaotic composition, particularly the presence of sharp, intersecting black lines. These lines, acting almost like slashes or ruptures across the canvas, suggest a forceful, aggressive, or conflicted energy. The prominent use of deep reds in certain areas also contributes to this feeling, as red is often associated with intense emotions, including passion and rage. The overall sense of forms clashing and overlapping, creating a visual tension and an explosion of fragmented elements, can be interpreted as a depiction of internal or external struggle, which often underpins anger. However, the anger is not overwhelming or dominant. The vibrant palette also includes many calming blues, greens, and yellows, and some forms are fluid and organic, balancing the harsher, angular elements. This creates a complex emotional landscape where anger exists as a forceful undercurrent or one component of a broader, intense experience, rather than as the sole or overriding emotion."
composition-8.jpg,abstract,35.0,"The painting evokes a subtle, internalized sense of anger rather than an overt, explosive display. The dominant use of deep, somber tones, particularly the pervasive blacks and dark blues, contributes to a heavy, brooding atmosphere that can be associated with suppressed or simmering negative emotions. The central figure, while abstract, possesses an imposing, almost monolithic presence, yet its ""body"" is fragmented and delineated by stark white outlines, suggesting a sense of internal disarray, tension, or a psychological breaking apart. This fragmentation, especially the sharp, almost jagged edges and distinct, separated components, can imply friction, discomfort, or a contained struggle that might be rooted in anger or frustration. Furthermore, elements like the sharp, dark spike on the upper left and the rigid, cross-hatched patterns elsewhere introduce a certain angularity and tension that are far from serene. However, the absence of explicit aggressive gestures, violent brushwork, or dominant fiery reds prevents the score from being higher. The anger here is not a raging storm but rather a deep-seated, perhaps internalized or repressed, undercurrent of disquiet or indignation."
composition-6.jpg,abstract,85.0,"The emotion of anger is powerfully conveyed in this abstract work, primarily through the audacious and dominant use of a vibrant, fiery red for the background. This color, universally associated with intense emotions, passion, and aggression, immediately sets a tone of heightened agitation and potentially explosive energy. The stark contrast created by the heavy, often jagged masses of deep black and somber gray forms against this searing red amplifies the sense of visual tension and confrontation.

The fragmented and fractured quality of the shapes, particularly those outlined by sharp, angular white lines, suggests a state of brokenness, rupture, or violent disruption. These aren't harmonious, flowing forms, but rather appear as if shattered or forcefully torn apart, a visual metaphor for anger's destructive capabilities. The textural details, visible in the close-ups, reveal a rough, almost visceral surface that further contributes to a raw, unpolished intensity.

Furthermore, the wavy, almost sinewy or root-like structures in the lower parts of the composition, rendered in agitated grey and white, convey a sense of restless movement, internal turmoil, or perhaps an unleashed, tumultuous force. The overall atmosphere is devoid of calm or serenity; instead, it is charged with an almost palpable sense of conflict, struggle, and disquiet, resonating strongly with the visceral experience of anger, whether simmering or erupting."
concentric-1925.jpg,abstract,70.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of dynamic force and agitated energy, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of anger. Several elements contribute to this:

*   **Sharp, Aggressive Forms:** The most striking feature contributing to a sense of anger are the numerous sharp, pointed forms throughout the composition. The large white shapes resemble jagged mountains or teeth, suggesting aggression, danger, or piercing force. Similarly, the spiky green forms at the bottom reinforce this feeling of sharpness and hostility.
*   **Vibrant and Clashing Colors:** While the palette is diverse, the strategic use of intense reds and deep blacks against other vivid hues adds to the emotional intensity. Red is commonly associated with passion, heat, and anger, and its presence, especially in the central-left and right elements, lends an aggressive edge. The dark black forms provide strong contrasts and a sense of weight or abruptness.
*   **Dynamic and Chaotic Composition:** The overall composition is highly dynamic, characterized by strong diagonal lines and a feeling of elements colliding, fragmenting, or exploding. This turbulent arrangement lacks serenity or calm, instead creating visual tension and a sense of disarray that mirrors the internal turmoil often associated with anger. The way forms appear to be clashing or tearing apart contributes to this perception.
*   **Sense of Forceful Movement:** The energetic brushstrokes and the implied motion of the shapes evoke a powerful, almost unrestrained, release of energy. This raw, untamed force is a key characteristic of anger's expression.
*   **Lack of Softness or Harmony:** There are very few soft, flowing, or harmonious elements. The visual language is one of hard edges, sharp points, and abrupt transitions, contributing to an overall feeling of agitation and potential conflict rather than peace or contentment."
constructivo-1933.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting, with its grid-like structure and symbolic iconography, primarily conveys a sense of order, universality, and philosophical contemplation rather than explicit emotion. While the prominent use of red could, in some contexts, be associated with strong feelings like anger or passion, here it serves more as a defining color for the structural elements and certain symbols, giving it a formalized, almost heraldic quality rather than an aggressive one. The black outlines reinforce the structured and controlled nature of the composition.

There are no dynamic or chaotic elements, no agitated brushstrokes, and no depictions of conflict, struggle, or emotional distress that would typically evoke anger. The figures of the man and woman are iconic and static, devoid of any expressive fury or agitation. The universal symbols, such as the heart, sun, moon, yin-yang, and basic elements of nature and human existence, are presented in a balanced and meditative manner. The overall impression is one of intellectual distillation and symbolic representation, which stands in stark contrast to the visceral, disruptive energy often associated with anger. The very low score reflects the near absence of visual cues that would suggest or provoke a feeling of anger in the viewer."
conglomerat-1943.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The emotion of anger is largely absent from this painting. The artwork exhibits a high degree of order, precision, and geometric balance, which fundamentally contradicts the chaotic, volatile, and often distorted visual language typically associated with anger. The lines are clean, crisp, and well-defined, showing no signs of franticness, aggression, or harshness. While some sharp angles and pointed forms exist, they are integrated seamlessly into the structured composition, serving as design elements rather than expressing any forceful or destructive intent.

The color palette, though varied, is predominantly vibrant and harmonious. The large, dominant yellow field often evokes cheerfulness or warmth, not rage. While small accents of red are present, they are contained within minor shapes and do not convey the overwhelming, clashing intensity that red can sometimes carry when used to express anger. The blues and purples in the background and within the forms contribute to a sense of calm and depth, further diminishing any potential for agitation. The overall arrangement of diverse abstract elements feels intellectual, systemic, or even whimsical, akin to an organized diagram or a collection of symbols, rather than an outburst of furious emotion. There are no figures or implied narratives that convey aggression or conflict. The painting's deliberate structure and clear forms prevent any significant sense of frustration, hostility, or fury from emerging."
crossing-1928.jpg,abstract,5.5,"The artwork, with its composition of stark vertical lines and subtle geometric shapes in muted earth tones, does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. There are no sharp, jagged forms, violent movements, or aggressive color combinations (such as vibrant reds or clashing contrasts) that are typically associated with feelings of rage or fury. The dominant verticality creates a sense of order or perhaps confinement, which while potentially leading to frustration in some contexts, does not translate directly into anger within this abstract setting. The subtle interplay of light and shadow, and the overall subdued palette, contribute to a rather contemplative or perhaps somber mood, rather than an agitated or aggressive one. The sensation is more of quiet intensity or structured depth than of emotional volatility. A very low score is given because while the starkness might resonate with a tiny hint of sternness or rigidity for some, it is far from an expression of anger."
construction-with-belltower-1932.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The emotion of anger is almost entirely absent from Joaquín Torres García's ""Universal Construction."" The painting's defining characteristic is its rigid, gridded composition, a hallmark of Constructivism, which inherently promotes order, rationality, and structure. Anger, by contrast, is often associated with chaos, disruption, and uncontrolled energy. The precise, almost architectural organization of the symbols within distinct blocks works against any sense of emotional turmoil or agitation.

Furthermore, the color palette is subdued and earthy, dominated by muted browns, grays, off-whites, and deep reds that are more somber than aggressive. There are no vibrant, clashing colors or harsh contrasts that might evoke irritation or fury. The brushwork, while visible and textural, is not frantic or violent; it appears deliberate and controlled, contributing to the overall sense of calm and collectedness.

The symbols themselves – a cross, a star, a bell, a key, clock faces, elements of a train, and letters – are universal archetypes or factual representations (like ""PLM"" for the railway). They are presented in an impersonal, almost diagrammatic manner, devoid of any specific narrative that would suggest conflict, injustice, or struggle. There are no distorted figures, scenes of violence, or expressions of pain that would typically trigger a response of anger. Instead, the artwork invites contemplation of universal forms and a structured view of the world, making it highly unlikely to evoke feelings of rage or resentment. The very low score reflects the near-total absence of characteristics that align with the emotion of anger."
conversations-1958.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. The color palette, composed primarily of mustard yellow, cream, white, and various shades of grey, lacks the aggressive, high-contrast, or intense hues (such as vibrant reds, harsh oranges, or stark, clashing blacks) typically associated with this emotion. Furthermore, the forms are geometric, clean-edged, and precisely rendered, featuring straight lines and a smooth, controlled curve. There are no jagged, chaotic, or fragmented shapes that might suggest aggression, violence, or turmoil. The composition, while dynamic, appears balanced and deliberately organized, rather than expressing agitation, disruption, or an overwhelming sense of conflict. The lines are crisp and well-defined, and there is no visible agitated brushwork or textural roughness that could convey emotional intensity. The overall aesthetic is one of formal exploration and intellectual arrangement, which stands in stark opposition to the raw, expressive qualities often used to depict anger in art. Any perceived tension from the intersecting lines or overlapping shapes is minimal and does not escalate to an angry emotional state."
dance-i.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork is an abstract stained glass piece composed of geometric shapes (triangles, rectangles, and curvilinear forms) in primary colors (yellow, blue, red) and white, outlined by thick black lines. There is absolutely nothing in this composition that suggests or evokes anger. The lines are clean, precise, and orderly, creating a sense of balance and deliberate design rather than chaos or aggression. The color palette, while bold with its use of primary colors, is harmonious and vibrant, lacking any clashing or unsettling combinations that might induce discomfort or tension. The red, often associated with strong emotions, is used sparingly and as an integral part of the overall balanced composition, not in an overwhelming or aggressive manner. There is no depiction of figures, actions, or environments that could be interpreted as angry. The overall feeling conveyed is one of clarity, structure, and visual dynamism, far removed from any sense of rage, frustration, or hostility."
cycle-48x60.jpg,abstract,75.0,"The painting conveys a significant sense of anger primarily through its highly dynamic composition and fragmented forms. The swirling, almost chaotic arrangement of sharp, angular shapes suggests a powerful, disruptive force at play, reminiscent of an explosion or a rapid unraveling. These sharp edges and fragmented planes evoke a feeling of tension and agitation, which are hallmarks of anger. The energy radiating outwards from the center, coupled with the sense of forms being torn or shattered, contributes to an impression of forceful, perhaps destructive, emotion.

Furthermore, the color palette, dominated by intense oranges, fiery golds, and deep, brooding browns and purples, enhances this feeling of simmering or explosive intensity. While not explicitly red, the warm, vibrant tones carry a fiery energy that can be associated with heated emotions. The interplay of light and shadow, with bright, almost blinding flashes against darker, more subdued areas, adds to the drama and emphasizes the turbulent motion. This combination of aggressive forms, vibrant yet intense colors, and an overall sense of energetic disruption strongly aligns with the feeling of anger, even in an abstract context. It's not a calm or serene image; rather, it pulses with an agitated, powerful undercurrent."
de-tio-st-rsta-n-10-alderdomen-1907.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely no visual information within this painting that elicits or suggests anger. The dominant color palette consists of soft pastels – a gentle pink background, muted blues, yellows, and a subdued, almost earthy red. These colors lack the vibrant intensity or aggressive saturation typically associated with feelings of anger or rage. Furthermore, the forms and lines are predominantly organic, flowing, and harmonious; curvilinear swirls, graceful loops, and a central grid of neatly arranged squares convey a sense of order, balance, and calm. There are no sharp, jagged, or chaotic lines that might imply conflict or aggression. The overall composition is serene and contemplative, with symbols that could be interpreted as spiritual or mathematical, such as the infinity symbol. There is no narrative content, human figures, or expressions that could convey anger. The painting's aesthetic is one of meditative abstraction and gentle beauty, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would provoke or reflect an emotional state of anger."
core-36x48.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting primarily evokes a sense of ethereal light, dynamic movement, and abstract form rather than direct emotional turmoil. There are no traditional visual cues associated with anger, such as aggressive gestures, distorted figures, chaotic brushwork indicative of rage, or a dominant use of colors typically linked to fury (like intense reds). While there are sharp, angular forms and a radiating ""burst"" effect, these elements contribute more to a sense of energetic expansion or breaking through, akin to a beam of light or a spiritual emanation, rather than an aggressive or violent outburst. The darker, more somber tones in the corners and background provide contrast and depth but do not project menace or hostility. Any hint of anger is extremely subtle, perhaps stemming from the inherent tension of abstract forms breaking or colliding, or the forceful directionality of the light rays. However, this is a very tenuous connection, as the overall impression leans towards a contemplative or even celestial atmosphere, rather than one of confrontational or destructive emotion."
dedicated-to-jacques-callot-1941.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting exhibits very little to no discernible qualities that would evoke a feeling of anger. The color palette, while containing some reds and oranges, uses them in muted, earthy, and almost faded tones rather than vibrant, aggressive hues typically associated with rage or confrontation. The predominant colors are browns, ochres, and muted greens, creating a calm, natural, and somewhat primitive atmosphere. The shapes are biomorphic and organic, characterized by rounded edges and flowing lines, which lack the sharp, jagged, or confrontational forms that might suggest aggression or tension. The figures, though abstract, appear more whimsical, contemplative, or simply existent within their space, without any visual cues of struggle, conflict, or overt emotional distress. There is no sense of violence, chaos, or harshness in the composition or execution. The overall texture seems earthy and grounded, contributing to a sense of antiquity or timelessness, rather than a volatile emotional state. The feeling conveyed is far more one of quiet mystery or ancient folklore than of agitation or fury, resulting in a very low score for anger."
dialogue-i-1967.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting, an abstract composition, employs a palette dominated by muted greens, lime, and earthy tones, which inherently do not carry strong connotations of aggression or rage. The lines are precise, geometric, and often schematic, resembling diagrams or circuit boards rather than embodying chaotic or furious gestures. While there are sharp angles and radiating lines that could imply energy or force, they do not read as violent or destructive. The overall composition feels balanced and analytical, rather than expressing agitation or frustration.

The only element that could remotely hint at a feeling akin to anger is the small, reddish-maroon, somewhat explosive-looking shape in the bottom-middle section, surrounded by white radiating lines. This isolated burst, though small and subdued in color, might be interpreted by some as a momentary eruption or a point of intense pressure. However, it is contained, doesn't dominate the canvas, and its reddish hue is muted rather than vibrant and aggressive. It could just as easily represent a signal, a pulse, or a contained energy release within a larger system. Therefore, any perceived anger is minimal, highly subjective, and overwhelmed by the painting's overall systematic and contemplative atmosphere."
deux-styles-1958.jpg,abstract,65.0,"The painting evokes a notable sense of anger through its dynamic composition and assertive color choices. The dominant use of strong, contrasting colors—particularly the vibrant red against deep black and stark white—immediately creates a high-tension atmosphere. Red is universally associated with intense emotions, including anger, and its placement as bold lines and interwoven shapes on the right side commands attention and conveys forceful energy.

The forms themselves contribute significantly to this feeling. The sharp, jagged white line that diagonally cuts through the center of the canvas acts as a forceful rupture, suggesting a sudden, impactful break or outburst. On the right, the complex, interlocking black and red shapes, with their sharp angles and swirling, almost struggling appearance, convey a sense of agitation, turmoil, and powerful, unyielding motion. These forms appear to be pushing or fighting against each other and the surrounding white space, creating a visual metaphor for internal or external conflict. While abstract, the lack of soft, flowing lines in these key areas, replaced by abrupt turns and fragmented elements, reinforces a feeling of edginess and lack of calm. The stark contrast and the perceived 'struggle' within the forms coalesce to express a strong, albeit abstract, presence of anger or powerful indignation."
double-impression-iv-1978.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The emotion of anger is scarcely discernible in this artwork, warranting a very low score. The dominant color is a vibrant, clear blue, which is more commonly associated with calmness, serenity, or coolness rather than the fiery intensity of anger. Similarly, the white shapes are neutral, lacking any inherent emotional charge that would suggest rage or aggression.

The shapes themselves are blocky, geometric, and somewhat irregular, giving them a rudimentary or pixelated appearance. While some might interpret the fragmented or deconstructed nature of these forms as reflecting disruption, this is a far cry from the volatile energy typically associated with anger. There are no sharp, violent, or explosive lines, nor is there a chaotic or turbulent composition that would convey a sense of uncontrolled fury or agitation. Instead, the arrangement, despite its abstract nature, maintains a certain visual order and balance within the square frame. The texture, though slightly rough or textured as if printed, does not suggest frantic or aggressive mark-making.

Any perceived ""anger"" would likely be projected by a viewer frustrated by the abstract nature or the lack of an obvious narrative, rather than being an emotion inherently expressed by the artwork's visual elements. The overall impression is more akin to a puzzle, a coded message, or a stylized map, engaging the intellect rather than stirring powerful negative emotions like anger."
draft-for-mural-in-the-unjuried-art-show-wall-b-1922.jpg,abstract,68.5,"The painting conveys a significant degree of dynamic tension and aggressive energy, contributing to an interpretation of anger. This is primarily achieved through the highly fragmented and sharp forms that populate the canvas, particularly the jagged white shapes at the bottom left and the spiky, almost erupting elements in the upper right. These sharp points and irregular outlines evoke a sense of impact, collision, and potential violence. The composition features strong diagonal lines, such as the prominent yellow streaks, which cut across the canvas with speed and force, adding to a feeling of forceful movement and agitated confrontation. The overall dynamism and apparent chaotic interaction between the two main, large abstract masses suggest a clashing or battling scenario rather than a harmonious one. While the vibrant colors prevent the feeling from being overwhelmingly dark or brooding, the intensity of their contrast against the black background, combined with the explosive and splintered nature of the forms, creates an atmosphere of high agitation and aggressive impact. There's a palpable sense of internal struggle or forceful release, aligning with emotional turbulence associated with anger."
e-1915.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting predominantly features bold, geometric shapes and primary colors (red, yellow, blue) against a stark black background, alongside white. While strong colors like red can sometimes be associated with intensity or passion, their application here is highly structured and decorative rather than emotionally expressive of anger. The lines are clean and defined, lacking the jagged, chaotic, or aggressive quality often associated with angry or violent brushwork. The checkerboard patterns and other regular forms suggest order, rhythm, and dynamism, not emotional upheaval or rage. There are no distorted figures, no tumultuous compositions, nor any discernible narrative elements that would depict or evoke anger. Even the abstract ""spiky"" shapes at the top left, which *could* be tenuously linked to aggression in a different context, are stylized and integrated into the overall geometric harmony, failing to transmit an emotional charge of anger. The overall impression is one of vibrant energy, structured playfulness, and visual rhythm, which are antithetical to feelings of anger or aggression. Any faint presence of anger would stem only from the inherent intensity of the primary colors and the stark black background, but this intensity is channeled into design and vibrancy rather than hostility."
duo-duel-1953.jpg,abstract,68.0,"The artwork evokes a significant sense of anger through its sharp, confrontational geometry and intense color contrasts. The dominant use of a vibrant, almost aggressive yellow alongside a deep, stark black creates an immediate visual tension, as these colors do not blend but rather clash forcefully against each other. The composition is highly dynamic and angular, characterized by strong diagonal lines that cut through the space, creating a fragmented and unsettling division. This fragmentation can be interpreted as a rupture or internal conflict, which is often symptomatic of anger. The central intersection of lines, particularly where the bold diagonals meet, suggests a point of impact or collision, further amplifying a sense of forceful energy and confrontation. The subtle horizontal hatching, especially visible within the darker areas and where colors transition, adds a vibrating, agitated quality to the surface, contributing to an overall feeling of intense disquiet and raw energy that aligns strongly with the physical and emotional manifestations of anger. The absence of soft curves or gentle transitions reinforces the hard-edged, uncompromising nature often associated with this powerful emotion."
erotic-6.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting is an abstract composition of various geometric and curvilinear shapes rendered in a palette of grays, white, black, pale pink, and a bright red-orange. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest or evoke anger. The lines are clean, precise, and well-defined, lacking any aggressive or chaotic quality. The shapes themselves do not convey any sense of conflict, tension, or aggression; rather, they seem to interlock and flow, creating a sense of balance and order. While the red-orange provides a vibrant contrast, its application is contained and serves more as a visual accent or a point of focus rather than an expression of fiery emotion or rage. There are no recognizable figures or expressions that could convey anger, nor are there any symbolic elements traditionally associated with this emotion (e.g., violence, struggle, destruction). The overall impression is one of calm abstraction, formal arrangement, and possibly contemplation, making any association with anger extremely remote. The score is not an absolute zero simply because, in abstract art, one can sometimes project *any* emotion, however subtly, but in this specific case, there is virtually nothing inherent in the visual language that would lead a viewer to feel or perceive anger."
e0c48c828bd324c01a0580fe6666b0e9.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting ""Je revois en souvenir ma chère Udnie"" by Francis Picabia contains no discernible elements that evoke or convey anger. Its abstract, mechanomorphic style, characterized by interlocking and overlapping geometric and curvilinear forms, creates a sense of dynamic movement and complexity, but not aggression or hostility. The color palette, featuring warm yellows and reds juxtaposed with cool greys, dark browns, and blacks, contributes to a vibrant and somewhat mysterious atmosphere, rather than one of rage or discord. There are no sharp, violent lines, clashing compositions, or expressive human figures that would suggest an angry emotional state. The overall impression is one of rhythmic motion, perhaps an exploration of memory or an impersonal aesthetic, entirely devoid of any visual cues typically associated with anger. The contemplative or nostalgic title further reinforces an emotional tone antithetical to anger."
encirclement.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The vibrant orange circles, while possessing a strong visual presence, convey warmth, luminosity, or celestial bodies, rather than aggression or rage. The dark blue background and the black rectangular field provide a stark but composed setting, suggesting depth and vastness rather than tension or conflict. There are no sharp, jagged lines, chaotic brushstrokes, or clashing elements that might visually represent anger. The forms are geometric and balanced, contributing to a feeling of order and quiet contemplation rather than emotional upheaval. The overall impression is one of calm, almost meditative abstraction, entirely devoid of any visual cues associated with anger, frustration, or hostility."
drawing-in-black-and-white-1962.jpg,abstract,35.5,"The emotion of anger in this painting is not overtly expressed through fiery colors or explosive, chaotic brushwork; however, it manifests as a subtle yet palpable undercurrent of tension and suppressed frustration. The fragmented and sharp, angular forms suggest a sense of breakage, conflict, or deconstruction. These disjointed elements, particularly the stark contrasts between the deep blacks and the lighter, almost metallic browns and whites, create a visual discord that can evoke feelings of irritation or antagonism. The prevalence of rigid, vertical lines can be interpreted as unyielding barriers or remnants of a struggle, contributing to a sense of oppression or confinement that might lead to internal anger. There's a certain starkness and brutality in the way shapes collide and are delineated, suggesting a forceful or aggressive origin to their current state. While not a furious rage, the painting conveys a cool, contained anger, a simmering frustration, or the residual tension from a past conflict, evident in its fractured composition and somber, almost melancholic, yet unyielding structure."
eroticon-1990.jpg,abstract,2.0,"This abstract painting presents a carefully composed interplay of geometric and curvilinear forms, utilizing a muted yet sophisticated color palette of black, white, various greys, a subtle rose, a deep blue, and a mustard yellow. There is virtually no visual language within the artwork that evokes the emotion of anger. The lines are predominantly smooth and flowing, with a deliberate, controlled quality. Even where straight lines and sharp angles occur, they are integrated within a balanced and interlocking structure, rather than creating a sense of tension, aggression, or rupture. There is a complete absence of jagged edges, chaotic brushstrokes, or explosive compositions that might suggest rage or frustration. The colors, while including dark tones, are applied in a manner that contributes to the overall harmonious and structured feel, rather than conveying a sense of foreboding, intensity, or raw fury. The overall impression is one of order, rhythm, and intellectual contemplation, rather than emotional turmoil or hostility. Any potential for tension inherent in the interlocking shapes is resolved into a balanced and aesthetically pleasing configuration, leaving no room for an angry emotional response."
espacillimit-1957.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting is highly abstract and composed of geometric shapes and bold, flat colors. While the color red is often associated with anger, its presence here is balanced by strong yellows, blues, blacks, and whites, preventing it from dominating or creating an overwhelming sense of aggression. The lines are clean, the forms are precise, and the overall composition, despite its varied elements, conveys a sense of order and design rather than chaos or conflict. Some sharp angles and points are present, particularly in the black zig-zag patterns and certain diamonds, which *could* introduce a slight hint of tension or assertiveness. However, these elements are integrated into a visually structured and non-narrative arrangement. There is no discernible subject matter that would typically provoke anger, nor are there any clashing colors or discordant forms that suggest agitation or frustration. The painting evokes a more intellectual or aesthetic appreciation, reminiscent of constructivist or De Stijl movements, rather than an emotional response rooted in anger. The overall impression is one of calculated balance and visual exploration, leaving very little room for feelings of irritation, frustration, or rage."
energy-field-1967.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent in this painting. The dominant color palette consists of various shades of yellow, beige, and light brown, which are typically associated with warmth, light, or neutrality, rather than intense emotions like anger. While there are some lines in a reddish-brown hue, they are thin, integrated into the overall composition, and not used in a manner that conveys aggression or dominance.

The lines and shapes are predominantly geometric and precise, including straight lines, structured grids, and orderly curves. Even the angular forms and arrow-like elements (such as those in the bottom left or the zig-zag patterns on the right) are rendered with a controlled hand and do not convey a sense of uncontrolled force, chaos, or aggression often associated with anger. There are no harsh, violent, or explosive brushstrokes or textures. Instead, the lines appear clean and deliberate, contributing to a sense of order and calm.

The overall composition feels balanced and organized, almost like a schematic or a complex map. There is no visual tension, clashing elements, or dynamic fragmentation that might suggest conflict or emotional outburst. The sense of movement, where present, feels directional and subtle rather than confrontational or agitated. The painting evokes a feeling of quiet contemplation, structure, or perhaps a gentle, unfolding narrative, all of which stand in stark contrast to the characteristics commonly linked to the emotion of anger."
espacillimit.jpg,abstract,3.5,"The artwork presents a highly structured, geometric abstraction dominated by clean lines, precise forms, and a cool color palette primarily featuring blues, white, and black, with accents of a soft pink/salmon. Elements typically associated with anger, such as chaotic composition, clashing colors, or aggressive, unrestrained brushwork, are conspicuously absent. The overall impression is one of order, precision, and systematic arrangement, which tends to evoke intellectual engagement or a sense of calm rather than strong emotional responses like anger.

While certain elements, specifically the repetitive, sharp black triangles and zig-zags, possess an angularity that *could* theoretically carry a slight edge or sense of rigidity, their consistent patterning and integration within the balanced composition mitigate any potential for aggression or harshness. These forms are presented with a calculated precision that feels more analytical and decorative than confrontational or emotionally charged. The predominant cool blues and the contrasting soft pink further soften the visual impact, dissolving any nascent sense of irritation or rage. The artwork's deliberate lack of expressive texture or spontaneous gesture also distances it from the raw, uninhibited qualities often found in art intended to convey anger. Therefore, the feeling of anger is almost entirely absent, manifesting as an exceedingly minimal, almost imperceptible, undercurrent that might only be perceived as a very slight impersonal sharpness by the most sensitive observer."
ezinor-1949.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The visual elements within this abstract painting offer very little to evoke a sense of anger. The color palette, consisting of muted tones – dark green, black, white, and a light beige – lacks the aggressive, intense, or clashing hues often associated with anger, such as vibrant reds or jarring contrasts. Instead, these colors tend to be more grounding, neutral, or even calming.

The shapes, while including some sharp angles and points, are integrated into a composition that feels more analytical or structured than chaotic or aggressive. The prominent black rectangle, for instance, is a strong, solid presence, but it doesn't convey rage or conflict. Similarly, the various geometric and curved forms in the lower half, while dynamic, are arranged in a way that suggests a puzzle, movement, or balance, rather than explosive energy or violent confrontation. There are no distorted figures, chaotic brushstrokes, or overwhelming visual tension that typically contribute to feelings of anger in art. The overall impression is one of contemplative abstraction and formal interplay, rather than emotional turmoil or fury."
farfalla.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. Its visual language is entirely devoid of elements typically associated with this emotion. The color palette, predominantly composed of cool blues, deep greens, a neutral white/light grey, and a calming yellow, lacks any of the fiery reds, oranges, or harsh, clashing tones that often signify rage or agitation. While black is present, it serves as a framing element and a strong structural contrast rather than conveying darkness or malevolence.

Furthermore, the composition is highly balanced, orderly, and geometric, with a clear central focus. The shapes, though varying from soft curves (the large central oval, the blue ""petals"") to sharp angles (the cruciform elements in the center, the rectangular black borders), are all precisely defined and harmoniously integrated. There is no visual chaos, jarring disarray, or aggressive brushwork that would suggest frustration or violence. The overlapping translucent layers create a sense of depth and contemplation, not a feeling of being overwhelmed or threatened. The overall impression is one of serenity, introspection, or intellectual abstraction, which are antithetical to the experience of anger. Any score above zero is a minuscule acknowledgment of the sharp angles in the very center and the strong contrast of black, which *could* theoretically carry a hint of tension for some, but this is negligible in the context of the overall calming effect."
euphoria-dada-1917.jpg,abstract,7.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this abstract work. While certain elements might subtly contribute to a sense of tension or dynamism, they do not coalesce into a feeling of rage, hostility, or aggression. The palette, though featuring a bold red shape centrally, utilizes this color more as an energetic focal point rather than a depiction of fury or violence. The red is balanced by other colors like vibrant yellows, cool blues, and earthy browns, preventing an overwhelming sense of discord often associated with anger. The fragmented and angular forms, particularly the large yellow triangle, could suggest a certain sharpness or disruption. However, these forms are integrated into a complex, layered composition that feels more about visual exploration and dynamic interplay than confrontation or aggression. There are no overt visual cues such as violent brushstrokes, chaotic energy, distorted figures, or destructive imagery that would directly evoke anger. The textures appear rough in some areas, but not to the extent of conveying uncontrolled rage or agitation. The overall impression is one of vibrant abstract design rather than emotional turmoil or an expression of hostile sentiment. Any perceived tension is slight and does not manifest as anger."
figure-rose-1937.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting, characterized by its geometric abstraction and a palette of muted greens, grays, browns, and whites, conveys absolutely no sense of anger. The forms are composed and static, resembling a deconstructed bust or an architectural study rather than a figure in distress or confrontation. There are no sharp, aggressive lines or jarring contrasts that might evoke irritation or fury. The colors are harmonious and subdued, lacking the vibrant reds or turbulent darks often associated with anger. The overall composition is balanced and thoughtful, suggesting intellectual analysis rather than emotional turmoil. There is no narrative element, dynamic movement, or expressive distortion that would hint at rage or frustration. The painting exudes a sense of quietude and structural experimentation, leaving no room for the turbulent or aggressive feelings that define anger."
fairy-tale-1970c.jpg,abstract,85.0,"The visual language of this abstract painting strongly conveys a profound sense of anger through its energetic and turbulent composition. The prevalence of sharp, jagged lines, particularly evident in the spiky forms and fragmented shapes throughout the canvas, immediately suggests aggression and discord. The vivid, almost clashing color palette, dominated by intense reds, hot pinks, fiery oranges, and deep blacks, creates a jarring contrast that evokes a sense of heated emotion and agitation. The red areas, especially where they appear as textured splatters or sharp protrusions, carry a potent emotional charge often associated with rage or an inflamed state.

The overall composition is highly chaotic and dynamic, with forms seemingly colliding and breaking apart, which can be interpreted as a visual representation of internal or external conflict. There is a palpable tension in the way shapes overlap and intersect, contributing to a feeling of unease and confrontation. Hints of distorted or monstrous forms, such as the suggestive ""eyes"" and ""teeth-like"" elements embedded within the abstract masses, further lend a menacing or aggressive undertone. The heavy black outlines and large dark masses provide a stark counterpoint to the vibrant hues, adding a sense of weight and intensity that underscores the unsettling nature of the piece. This is not a subtle or serene work; its visual ferocity and discordant energy resonate strongly with the emotional landscape of anger."
fire-flower-made-in-cooperation-with-galyna-zubchenko-and-victor-zaretsky-1960c.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The artwork exhibits virtually no visual elements that would typically evoke anger. The color palette is vibrant and diverse, featuring bright reds, oranges, yellows, blues, and purples, which are generally associated with energy, joy, or passion rather than aggression or wrath. There are no dark, brooding, or clashing colors used in a way that suggests negative emotion. While the central motif is a large star-like shape with sharp points and radiating lines, these elements convey dynamism, expansion, and light, not hostility or aggression. The intricate patterns within the central heart-like section are organic and swirling, contributing to a sense of complex beauty and creativity, not frustration or turmoil. The overall composition is balanced and radiant, drawing the eye towards the intricate center and outward along its rays, which evokes a sense of harmony and energetic flow rather than discord or fury. There are no depictions of struggle, pain, or violent imagery. The meticulous craftsmanship evident in the piece, particularly the precise arrangement of materials, suggests careful deliberation and patience, qualities antithetical to impulsive anger. The small amount of perceived anger (1.5 out of 100) might be attributed by some to the sharp points of the stars and rays, which could be vaguely interpreted as aggressive by a highly sensitive viewer, but this is a minimal and largely counteracted by the overwhelming positive and energetic visual language of the entire piece."
goat-1934.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of anger. There are no visual cues commonly associated with this emotion, such as harsh or aggressive color palettes (e.g., strong reds or jarring contrasts), violent or chaotic brushstrokes, or imagery depicting conflict, aggression, or distress. The subject matter, an animal in what appears to be a natural setting, is not inherently anger-inducing. The colors used—various shades of green, brown, white, and a pale blue—are largely natural and tend to evoke a sense of calm or earthiness rather than agitation or fury. The lines, while bold, are used to define form rather than express rage or hostility. The overall composition and mood are placid, contemplative, or perhaps dynamically natural, completely devoid of any element that would provoke feelings of anger in the viewer."
fragile-1931.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, dominated by deep blues, cool grays, and whites, inherently lacks the warm, intense, or fiery colors typically associated with anger. The few touches of yellow do not introduce any sense of discord or aggression. Furthermore, the forms are geometric and precisely rendered—circles, triangles, rectangles, and a large, encompassing arc. These shapes are arranged with a sense of balance and order, creating a harmonious and stable composition rather than one that is chaotic, clashing, or explosive. There are no jagged lines, violent brushstrokes, or turbulent movements that could visually manifest anger. The overall impression is one of calm, spatial vastness, or cosmic serenity, with elements appearing to float peacefully. The structured and contemplative nature of the artwork directly opposes any visual cues that would suggest agitation, fury, or hostility, thereby registering an almost negligible presence of anger."
figuras-a-cinco-colores-1946.jpg,abstract,68.0,"The painting evokes a notable degree of anger primarily through its assertive use of color, sharp geometric forms, and dynamic, fragmented composition. The prevalence of vibrant red, often associated with intensity, passion, and fury, immediately commands attention and injects a sense of heat and agitation into the artwork. This is powerfully contrasted by the extensive use of black, which provides a stark, heavy, and sometimes menacing grounding, amplifying the visual tension and creating a sense of severity.

The strict adherence to straight lines and sharp angles, forming rectangles, squares, and triangles, contributes to a rigid and unyielding quality. The diagonal lines, in particular, introduce a disruptive energy that prevents any sense of calm or repose; they suggest forceful movement, collision, or a clashing of elements. The overall composition is highly fragmented, with interlocking and overlapping shapes that give the impression of elements forcefully interacting or even breaking apart. This visual discord, while structured, hints at an underlying friction or conflict.

There is a complete absence of soft curves or organic shapes, which might otherwise mitigate the intensity. Instead, the hard-edged precision and bold contrasts create an unyielding visual experience. The energy conveyed is not one of harmony or peace, but rather of strong, assertive, almost confrontational force. While not depicting an explicit scene of rage, the painting's aesthetic language—its boldness, visual weight, strong contrasts, and dynamic angularity—resonates deeply with the raw, forceful, and agitated qualities often associated with anger. It's a contained, structural anger rather than an explosive one, yet its presence is undeniable."
golden-people-1999.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. Its visual language is composed of soft, organic, and rounded forms that interlock and blend harmoniously. There are no sharp angles, jagged lines, or explosive shapes that might suggest aggression, tension, or conflict. The color palette, while rich and varied, leans towards earthy tones and muted shades (greens, browns, blues, softened reds and purples) rather than harsh, clashing, or overtly intense hues that could evoke agitation or rage. Furthermore, the textures, whether striped, cross-hatched, or subtly mottled, are applied in a controlled and consistent manner, contributing to a sense of order and calm rather than disarray or turmoil. The overall composition feels balanced and contemplative, creating an atmosphere that is serene, perhaps introspective, but entirely devoid of any emotional resonance with anger. The minimal score acknowledges the abstract nature of the art and the inherent subjectivity of emotional interpretation, but fundamentally, there are no discernible visual elements that communicate or embody the emotion of anger."
four-crosses-1924.jpg,abstract,3.0,"The presence of anger in this painting is extremely minimal, almost negligible. The overall palette is dominated by soft, cool, and ethereal tones—various shades of blue, light green, lavender, and white—which typically evoke feelings of calm, spirituality, or introspection rather than agitation or wrath. While there are elements of red and orange, particularly in the four prominent crosses and some scattered strokes, these colors are not used in an aggressive, dominating, or explosive manner. They appear as distinct, almost symbolic markers within a largely serene, flowing background, rather than an angry outpouring.

The brushwork is predominantly fluid, blended, and soft, contributing to a sense of gentle movement and ethereal atmosphere. There are no sharp, violent, or frantic brushstrokes that would typically convey an angry emotional state. The abstract forms, including the central oval and swirling shapes, suggest cosmic or organic processes, but they lack the jaggedness, fragmentation, or chaotic energy often associated with rage. Even the distinct, stark nature of the orange crosses, while potentially symbolic of suffering or a harsh reality, does not translate visually into an expression of anger. The painting's overall emotional resonance leans more towards contemplation, mystery, or a spiritual journey, with virtually no visual cues that suggest animosity, aggression, or a fiery temper. Any perceived hint of anger would be an extreme stretch of interpretation, not a direct visual message conveyed by the artist's choices of color, line, or composition."
football.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this abstract artwork. While the piece features sharp, angular lines and fragmented geometric shapes that create a sense of dynamism and perhaps a mild tension, these elements do not translate into a feeling of rage or hostility. The use of various colors, including red, does not convey aggression as they are balanced by blues, greens, and yellows, and are applied with a somewhat soft, pastel-like texture rather than harsh, clashing strokes. There are no visual cues of violence, struggle, or explicit emotional turmoil. The composition, while energetic and fractured, appears more as an exploration of form and movement rather than an expression of an agitated or furious state. The overall impression is one of structured energy and formal deconstruction, rather than an outburst of anger. Therefore, any perceived anger is extremely subtle, indirect, and likely a very minor byproduct of the work's inherent dynamism, far from a dominant emotional theme."
han-i-on-yellow-1955.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting contains no discernible elements that evoke or suggest the emotion of anger. The color palette, dominated by muted beige and earthy brown tones with a single, small, serene light blue accent, lacks the fiery reds, deep blacks, or harsh, clashing contrasts typically associated with rage or hostility. The forms themselves are abstract, organic, and somewhat irregular, but they do not possess sharp, jagged, or aggressive lines that would convey tension or violence. There are no dynamic or explosive compositional elements that might suggest a burst of temper or emotional upheaval. Instead, the arrangement of shapes appears relatively stable and even contemplative, almost like ancient glyphs or stacked natural forms. The texture, while somewhat rough, does not read as furious or agitated but rather as earthy or aged. The overall mood conveyed by the artwork is one of quietude, introspection, or a subtle melancholic beauty, entirely devoid of any sense of fury, irritation, or confrontation."
gr-relief-ii-1932.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork presents a highly structured, almost architectural or mechanical assemblage, characterized by precise geometric forms and a restrained, monochromatic palette of white, black, and various shades of grey. There are no visual elements commonly associated with the emotion of anger. The composition is balanced and static, lacking dynamic tension, chaotic elements, or aggressive lines that could convey frustration, conflict, or rage. The sharp edges and industrial forms contribute to a sense of order and perhaps functionality, rather than any emotional turmoil. There are no depictions of figures expressing anger, no violent or unsettling movements, nor any clashing colors or agitated textures that might induce such a feeling. The overall impression is one of cool detachment, precision, and a calculated aesthetic, which stands in direct contrast to the characteristics typically used to evoke anger. Therefore, the artwork neither expresses nor elicits anger."
grey-space.jpg,abstract,92.5,"The painting very powerfully conveys a sense of intense anger through its highly dynamic and fractured composition. The visual language is one of explosion, fragmentation, and chaotic energy, all strongly associated with the outward manifestation of rage.

Firstly, the multitude of sharp, intersecting lines and angular shapes creates an overwhelming feeling of tension and conflict. These lines, especially the radiating white and thin colored ones, suggest a powerful, destructive force emanating from a central point, like a furious outburst or an object shattering violently. The numerous black, chaotic scribbles concentrated in the center amplify this sense of turbulent, uncontrolled energy and internal turmoil, mirroring the agitation and disarray often felt or expressed during anger.

Secondly, the color palette, though diverse, uses specific colors to heighten this emotion. The prominent use of deep red in several large, angular shapes directly links to traditional associations of anger, passion, and aggression. When combined with the overwhelming sense of rupture and collision, these red elements feel particularly volatile. The stark white lines, while possibly indicating light or speed, also contribute to the sharp, almost piercing quality of the composition, further enhancing the feeling of a harsh, aggressive impact. The dark background and the chaotic black lines add to a sense of foreboding or a destructive force at play.

Finally, the overall impression is one of rapid, almost violent movement and disintegration. The fragmented shapes, some resembling birds or abstract forms caught in the maelstrom, contribute to a sense of distress or a volatile situation, further reinforcing the emotional intensity. The lack of discernible order and the pervasive sense of sharp, impactful elements strongly evoke the raw, explosive nature of anger."
house-on-the-water-1930.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The visual elements of this painting are overwhelmingly antithetical to any sensation of anger. The color palette, dominated by soft, translucent washes of peach/orange, various shades of blue, and delicate grays and creams, is inherently calming and serene. There are no sharp, jarring contrasts, nor any aggressive, fiery reds or deep, ominous blacks that might symbolically align with fury. Furthermore, the composition is meticulously structured and geometric, featuring precisely delineated rectangles and squares that overlap and recede. This orderly arrangement evokes a sense of balance, harmony, and thoughtful contemplation, rather than the chaos, disruption, or frenetic energy often associated with anger. The transparency and layering of the colors create a gentle, ethereal quality, devoid of any harshness or tension. There are no violent or abrupt brushstrokes; instead, the application appears smooth and controlled, contributing to the overall sense of tranquility. The entire aesthetic leans towards quiet introspection and visual harmony, leaving no room for the tumultuous, agitated, or confrontational feelings that anger embodies. The miniscule score of 0.5 acknowledges the almost imperceptible potential for any human emotion to be entirely absent from perception, but fundamentally, this artwork communicates nothing that could be interpreted as anger or its provocation."
hot-air-balloon-1926.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting presents a composition of geometric forms and colors that register as almost entirely devoid of any resonance with anger. The shapes themselves—a large striped sphere, a rectangular block, and a cylinder—are static and orderly, lacking any aggressive lines, chaotic movements, or dynamic tension that might imply conflict or frustration. The choice of colors, while vibrant on the sphere (red, black, green, yellow), are arranged in a regular, almost decorative pattern, and are set against a muted, calm green background and gray/off-white blocks. There is no sense of jarring discord or harshness in the color palette that would typically evoke irritation or rage. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the piece means there is no discernible narrative or subject matter that could depict injustice, struggle, or any human or natural phenomena that would provoke an angry response. The overall impression is one of stillness, balance, and a somewhat contemplative detachment, which are antithetical to the agitated, often volatile nature of anger. The painting offers no visual cues of aggression, hostility, or emotional turmoil."
hanging-garden-1973.jpg,abstract,42.0,"The visual language of this artwork contains elements that subtly evoke a sense of anger or intense agitation. The most prominent contributors are the dark, heavily outlined forms that surround and encroach upon the central blue shape. These forms are not organic or flowing; instead, many feature sharp points, angular edges, and claw-like extensions that appear to be actively pressing, gripping, or even tearing into the blue core. This dynamic creates a strong sense of visual conflict and tension, mirroring the internal turmoil often associated with anger or frustration. The heavy black outlines and the somewhat smudged, dense texture within these dark shapes add to their imposing and somewhat aggressive character, suggesting a brooding intensity rather than a calm state. The absence of soft, yielding shapes or harmonious gradients further reinforces this feeling of agitation and an underlying struggle. While not an overt depiction of rage, the aggressive geometry and the sense of containment or assault upon the central element contribute to a palpable undercurrent of dissatisfaction or latent anger within the composition."
ile-de-france-1935.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting exhibits an extremely low degree of anger. The dominant aesthetic is one of calm, precise abstraction and carefully considered composition, which actively works against any sense of agitation or fury.

Firstly, the color palette is predominantly cool and muted, featuring various shades of blue, gray, and white, with understated accents of olive green, purple, and muted reddish-brown. There are no vibrant, aggressive reds, clashing contrasts, or jarring color combinations that might evoke feelings of anger or aggression. The large areas of cool blue and serene grays contribute to an overall tranquil atmosphere.

Secondly, the forms and shapes, while varied and overlapping, lack the sharp, jagged edges or violently fragmented elements typically associated with anger. Many of the shapes possess soft curves or rounded edges (like the prominent dark blue and gray cylindrical forms), which lend a sense of softness rather than harshness. Even the more rectangular or angular elements are presented cleanly and without a sense of chaotic disruption or tension that would signify conflict.

Thirdly, the composition, despite its complexity and multiple overlapping layers, maintains a balanced and controlled appearance. There is no sense of explosive energy, jarring imbalance, or uncontrolled dynamism that could be interpreted as an angry outburst. The elements seem to be deliberately placed, suggesting intellectual contemplation rather than emotional turmoil. The smooth, unblemished surfaces and precise edges further reinforce a sense of order and control, rather than expressive rage or frustration. The slight visual tension created by the overlapping forms is more akin to intellectual engagement than emotional distress."
holding-it-together-48x48.jpg,abstract,18.0,"The painting exhibits a significant degree of dynamism and visual tension through its sharp, angular forms and fragmented planes. The composition suggests a forceful, almost explosive or tearing motion, particularly emanating from the darker, more concentrated area in the upper-left quadrant. This sense of disruption, breaking apart, and intense energy could be metaphorically linked to the destructive or forceful aspects of anger. The sharp lines radiating outwards create a visual 'shattering' effect, implying a powerful impact or internal turmoil. However, the emotion of anger is heavily diluted by the predominant cool color palette of blues, greys, and whites. These colors, along with the bright, almost ethereal light present in large sections of the canvas, temper any potential for raw, fiery rage. There is no warmth or aggressive red typically associated with overt anger. Instead, the intensity feels more like a controlled abstraction of force, stress, or change rather than an uncontrolled emotional outburst. While there's an aggressive edge due to the sharp forms and intense movement, it lacks the visceral heat and raw emotional expression usually tied to anger."
hangingon-60x48.jpg,abstract,25.0,"The painting evokes a subtle and abstract sense of anger, primarily through its use of sharp, cutting lines and fragmented forms. The prominent, vibrant red lines that slash across the canvas, particularly the long, linear stroke in the mid-right, can be interpreted as symbols of tension, aggression, or a forceful, disruptive presence. Red is a color frequently associated with anger and passion, and here it serves as a stark, assertive contrast to the more muted background, suggesting a rupture or conflict. Furthermore, the fragmented, angular, and almost shattered appearance of the geometric planes and structures throughout the composition could allude to destruction, breakdown, or violent forces at play, which are often outcomes or manifestations of anger. However, the overall mood is not one of overt rage or explosive fury. The dominant palette of dark blues, browns, and grays lends a somber, perhaps even melancholic or contemplative tone, rather than an intense, fiery one. There are no direct visual cues of figures expressing anger, nor is the brushwork consistently aggressive or chaotic enough to suggest a visceral emotional outburst. Instead, the anger present is more a symbolic representation of underlying tension, structural conflict, or the aftermath of destructive forces, rather than an immediate, felt emotion of anger."
imploding-cosmos-1992.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The visual elements within this painting exhibit virtually no characteristics typically associated with the emotion of anger. There is a complete absence of aggressive or clashing colors; the dominant palette consists of earthy browns, muted whites, and subtle specks of pale blue, which do not carry the intensity or confrontational energy of hues like vibrant reds, sharp oranges, or deep, oppressive blacks often found in works expressing rage. Furthermore, the composition is centered around a circular form, a shape inherently associated with wholeness, harmony, and completeness, rather than the sharp, jagged lines, fragmented forms, or explosive dynamics that might convey tension, violence, or emotional upheaval. The intricate, granular texture, while dense and detailed, is composed of small, somewhat uniform elements, lacking the turbulent brushstrokes, chaotic movement, or disruptive force that could suggest active emotional turmoil or aggression. The overall impression is one of detailed observation or organic density, which is far removed from the destructive or agitated nature of anger. The painting offers no visual cues – be it in color, form, or suggested movement – that would incite or reflect an angry state."
kateau-1953.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting displays no visual cues that would typically evoke or represent anger. The color palette consists of soothing blues and purples against a neutral light grey background; these cool tones are inherently calming and antithetical to the fiery, intense hues often associated with anger (such as reds, oranges, or deep, oppressive blacks). The shapes within the composition are abstract, featuring smooth, rounded, and flowing forms, along with organized horizontal lines, some straight and some gently undulating. There are no sharp, jagged, aggressive, or chaotic lines or forms that might suggest confrontation, rupture, or violent energy. The overall composition feels balanced, serene, and even meditative, with a sense of gentle movement rather than explosive force or tension. The aesthetic is one of harmony and tranquility, which offers absolutely no foundation for an emotional response of anger. The extremely low score reflects the complete absence of any visual elements that could be interpreted as conveying or inducing anger."
invention-composition-31-1933.jpg,abstract,12.5,"The painting, with its sharp, angular geometric shapes and a composition that suggests an explosive or scattering motion from a central, darker void, contains a very subtle and abstract undercurrent that *might* be interpreted as a form of agitated energy or disruption. The fragmented elements appear to be in dynamic disarray, which could evoke a sense of things being forcibly torn apart or dislocated, bearing a remote resemblance to the destructive or disruptive force that anger can embody. However, this interpretation is highly abstract and not directly conveyed. The color palette, predominantly featuring cool blues, purples, and greens with lighter yellow accents, lacks the hot, aggressive hues (like strong reds or deep oranges) typically associated with intense anger. There are no explicit confrontational elements, figures expressing rage, or overtly violent imagery. The precision and cleanliness of the geometric forms, even in their apparent chaos, lend a controlled rather than a volatile quality to the disruption. Therefore, while a distant echo of agitated energy might be perceived, the direct emotional resonance of anger is extremely muted and almost entirely absent from this composition."
immanence-2004.jpg,abstract,78.0,"The depiction of anger in this artwork is conveyed through a powerful combination of agitated forms, dynamic lines, and strategic use of color. The pervasive turbulent, swirling masses, particularly noticeable in the upper and central portions of the composition, visually evoke a sense of chaotic energy and unrest, akin to an emotional outburst or a storm brewing. These forms are not serene; instead, they appear to be in constant motion, suggesting a forceful, almost eruptive discharge. The prominent, bold red curved lines slashing across the canvas immediately draw the eye, and red is a color universally associated with strong emotions, including passion and aggression. Their sweeping, forceful trajectory reinforces a sense of uncontrolled power and intensity. Furthermore, elements like the ""sunburst"" or explosion on the far right, with its radiating lines, contribute to an overall impression of powerful, potentially destructive, energy release. The intricate and often overlapping linework creates a frenetic atmosphere, suggesting a state of heightened agitation or frustration where underlying order (represented by grid lines) is overridden by dynamic, almost impulsive movements. While there are no explicit angry figures or literal representations of violence, the abstract visual language consistently points towards a significant level of intense, non-calm, and forceful energy that aligns strongly with the feeling of anger. The energy conveyed is active and impactful, far from a state of peace or neutrality."
komposition-1950.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting presents no discernible elements that would evoke or represent anger. The color palette, consisting primarily of muted browns, grays, whites, and soft blues/pinks against a beige background, is entirely devoid of the vibrant reds or harsh contrasts often associated with this emotion. The shapes, while abstract and varied, do not convey aggression, sharp conflict, or chaotic energy; instead, they appear to be thoughtfully arranged, some angular and some more fluid, contributing to a sense of balance rather than agitation. There are no depicted figures, scenes, or actions that could be interpreted as angry or confrontational. The overall impression of the artwork is one of calm abstraction, geometric exploration, or perhaps a subdued contemplation, utterly lacking in the visual tension, turmoil, or intensity that anger would typically manifest."
jesenji-dan-70-cm-x-50-cm-akril-na-paliru-2016.jpg,abstract,90.5,"The painting strongly conveys anger through its forceful application, agitated textures, and clashing color scheme. The thick impasto and visible brushstrokes suggest a rapid, almost violent energy in its creation, mirroring the physical manifestation of rage. Sharp, aggressive slashes of vivid yellow and fiery red cut through and are juxtaposed against deep, turbulent blues and dark, murky tones, creating significant visual tension and discord. This chaotic interplay of bright, almost screaming colors with dark, heavy ones evokes a sense of intense internal turmoil and outward aggression. There is a complete absence of softness or calm; instead, the entire canvas pulsates with a raw, unrestrained energy that feels like an eruption of powerful, untamed emotion. The fragmented forms and overwhelming sense of movement contribute to an impression of overwhelming fury, making anger a dominant and palpable emotion."
komposition-1919.jpg,abstract,75.8,"The visual language of this artwork strongly conveys a sense of anger through several compelling elements. The dominant use of stark black against white, creating extremely high contrast, immediately generates a feeling of tension and confrontation. This dramatic chiaroscuro is inherently aggressive, forcing the eye to contend with abrupt shifts rather than gentle transitions, which mirrors the volatile nature of anger. Furthermore, the composition is heavily reliant on sharp, jagged angles and fragmented forms. Triangles and pointed shapes pierce through the visual field, imparting a sense of violence, disruption, and aggression. There are very few, if any, soft or curvilinear forms to mitigate this harshness, contributing to an agitated and confrontational atmosphere. The overall chaotic and disjointed arrangement of these forms suggests a breakdown or conflict, a visual representation of internal turmoil often associated with anger. The implied brushstrokes or marks appear heavy and forceful, suggesting a vigorous, almost violent application of the medium, which directly communicates a strong, uncontrolled energy reminiscent of enraged actions. The absence of any discernible narrative or calming elements means the viewer is left with an overwhelming impression of agitation and discord, embodying a deep-seated, simmering, and confrontational form of anger."
improvisation-209-1917(1).jpg,abstract,28.0,"The emotion of anger is present in this painting to a very limited extent, primarily as an underlying current of tension and dynamism rather than an overt expression. Kandinsky's ""Cossacks"" is a work of abstract expressionism, relying on color, form, and composition to evoke feeling. The presence of sharp, jagged forms and strong, contrasting lines, particularly visible in the white ""mane"" on the left, the dark abstract elements in the lower left, and the fragmented shapes throughout, creates a sense of visual friction and potential conflict, which can be loosely associated with the energy of anger. The overall chaotic and energetic movement within the composition, with forms seemingly clashing or rushing past one another, suggests a powerful, even aggressive, dynamism. The prominent use of red in the upper right quadrant, a color frequently linked to anger, passion, or danger, also contributes slightly to this feeling. However, its amorphous shape and context don't make it solely indicative of rage; it could equally represent pure energy or spiritual fervor. The abstraction of the figures means there are no clear facial expressions or bodily gestures that directly convey anger. The intensity present in the painting feels more like a generalized struggle, spiritual striving, or powerful, unbridled energy rather than focused, destructive rage. The predominant blues and yellows, often associated with calm, spirituality, or joy, temper the potential for pure anger. Therefore, while elements of tension and dynamic conflict exist, which could tangentially touch upon the energy sometimes found in anger, the emotion itself is not a dominant or clearly articulated message of the artwork."
mask-4-1936.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting, an abstract composition of biomorphic shapes, presents very few elements that would evoke or represent anger. The forms are predominantly rounded, soft, and fluid, lacking the sharp angles, jagged edges, or chaotic lines often associated with aggression or fury. There is no sense of tension, conflict, or struggle in the way the shapes interact; instead, they appear to gently intertwine or float. The color palette, while varied, consists mostly of muted or earthy tones, and even the bolder red shape is rendered in a soft, non-threatening manner. There are no harsh contrasts or clashing colors that might create a sense of agitation or discomfort. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, there are no discernible figures or narratives that could depict angry expressions, gestures, or situations. The overall impression is one of calm, organic forms, which stands in stark contrast to the visual characteristics typically linked to the emotion of anger."
kompozycja-morska-wenus-1933.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting evokes very little, if any, sense of anger. There is a notable absence of visual elements typically associated with this emotion. The color palette, composed of light brown, light blue, white, and a muted off-white background, lacks the fiery reds, stark blacks, or harsh contrasts that often signify aggression or rage. The shapes within the composition are predominantly organic, soft, and flowing, resembling natural formations or fluid blobs, rather than sharp, jagged, or angular forms that could suggest tension or conflict. The black lines, while bold, are smooth, continuous, and looping, contributing to a sense of fluidity rather than disruption or violence. There is no depiction of violent motion, collision, or any confrontational imagery. The texture within the brown areas, though somewhat agitated with visible brushstrokes, reads more as subtle movement or an earthy quality than a turbulent or furious agitation. The overall impression is one of calm, contemplation, or perhaps gentle, abstract mapping, rather than an expression of anger. Any trace of agitation is extremely minimal and doesn't translate to anger."
l-enclume-1952.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. The dominant color palette, primarily consisting of muted browns, beiges, and earthy tones, lacks the vivid, high-contrast, or intense hues (such as aggressive reds or stark blacks) typically associated with expressions of rage or fury in art. Furthermore, the lines within the composition, while varied, are largely flowing and organic, with many graceful curves and smooth transitions. There is an absence of jagged, sharp, or violent lines and forms that would convey aggression or a sense of conflict. Even the more energetic, scribble-like elements in the upper right quadrant possess a dynamic, rather than hostile, character. The overall composition appears relatively balanced and meditative, without the chaotic disarray or visual tension often used to evoke feelings of anger or agitation. The brushwork, though varied in texture, does not convey a sense of hurried or aggressive application. Therefore, based on the formal elements, there is very little visual language that communicates anger."
lanscape-ii-1960.jpg,abstract,7.5,"The painting does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. There are no aggressive gestures, sharp, clashing forms, or violent imagery present. The abstract nature of the shapes, while somewhat fragmented and disjointed, suggests more of an internal landscape or a dream-like quality rather than overt conflict or rage. The color palette, while featuring a strong red background, which can sometimes be associated with anger, here feels more like a deep, earthy, or even somber hue that envelops the scene rather than actively provoking fury. The blues and greens within the composition tend to cool and subdue any potential intensity from the red. The overall feeling is more one of quiet mystery, introspection, or perhaps a subdued melancholy due to the dark tones and somewhat ambiguous forms. There are no elements that specifically convey a sense of aggression, frustration, or hostility that would point to a significant level of anger. The score is low because anger is largely absent, with only a very minor suggestion derived from the general intensity of the red background, which, in certain contexts, can carry a connotation of strong emotion, including anger, but it is not the dominant or intended feeling here."
john.jpg,abstract,68.0,"The artwork conveys a significant degree of anger primarily through its highly energetic, chaotic, and aggressive brushwork. The most prominent area contributing to this emotion is the dense cluster of black ink in the upper right quadrant. Here, the lines are entangled, scratchy, and appear to have been applied with vigorous, almost violent, force, resembling furious scribbling or an uncontrolled burst of agitated energy. The numerous sharp angles, fragmented strokes, and ink splatters within this section strongly suggest a release of intense emotional turmoil. Furthermore, many individual strokes and forms throughout the painting possess jagged edges and sharp points (e.g., the ""teeth""-like shapes and fragmented patterns in the bottom half), which can be associated with tension, irritation, or aggression. The overall lack of harmonious or smooth lines, coupled with the stark black ink against the light background, contributes"
lines-1922.jpg,abstract,15.0,"The painting evokes a very minimal sense of anger. While there are sharp, intersecting black lines that could suggest friction, tension, or a sudden, decisive movement, these elements primarily contribute to the overall dynamism and complexity of the composition rather than conveying outright aggression or rage. The color palette, predominantly composed of cool greys, blues, greens, and muted pastels, does not lean into the fiery reds, oranges, or deep, oppressive tones typically associated with anger. Although some warm hues are present, particularly on the right side, they are not dominant or intense enough to signify strong emotional heat. The fluid, organic shapes and the playful inclusion of various colored circles further detract from any aggressive undertone. The overall energy feels more like a vibrant, evolving cosmic landscape or a musical composition, rather than an expression of fury or an emotional outburst. Therefore, the presence of anger is extremely subdued, limited to very subtle hints of abstract tension, which falls far short of conveying a true sense of rage."
landscape-with-red-spots-1913.jpg,abstract,65.0,"The painting evokes a palpable sense of anger through several distinct visual cues. Firstly, the pervasive and dominant use of vivid red throughout the composition is a primary indicator. Red is intrinsically linked to heightened emotions, including aggression, fury, and passion. Here, these fiery patches of red appear almost like explosive bursts or raw, exposed emotion, especially where they meet other colors in sharp contrast. Secondly, the dynamic and often tumultuous forms contribute significantly to this feeling. There are sharp, jagged peaks and points, particularly on the left, which suggest an aggressive edge or a threatening posture. The sweeping, heavy dark blue and brown forms, especially the large arched shape, possess a forceful, almost oppressive weight that could signify a brewing storm or an unleashed power associated with anger. Furthermore, the overall composition is far from serene; it is characterized by intense movement, strong contrasts, and a turbulent energy that hints at agitation and emotional discord. The lack of gentle curves or soft transitions, coupled with the apparent disarray of some abstract elements, reinforces a feeling of inner turmoil or outward vehemence. While abstract, the painting's forceful palette and agitated structure powerfully convey a state of intense, unbridled emotion that aligns strongly with anger."
movement-sea-ultramarine-and-green-sky-cerulean-and-grey-1947.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. The color palette, consisting primarily of blues, greens, and a beige background, with a prominent red circle and some reddish accents, does not contain hues typically associated with intense rage or aggression (like deep, turbulent reds, harsh blacks, or clashing, dissonant combinations). While red can signify intensity, the isolated red circle here feels more like a symbolic element (perhaps a sun or a buoy) rather than an expression of fury. The brushstrokes are loose, fluid, and expressive, conveying movement and vitality, particularly in the water sections, but they lack the sharp, violent, or agitated quality that might suggest anger or turmoil. There are no discernible figures or scenes depicting conflict, struggle, or frustration. The overall impression is one of abstract landscape or waterscape, possibly depicting a lively outdoor scene, which leans more towards dynamic calm or playfulness than any form of aggressive emotion. The lack of harsh lines, discordant forms, or narrative elements hinting at distress or confrontation leaves very little visual information to interpret as anger."
meditations-1970c.jpg,abstract,68.0,"The painting conveys a significant degree of anger through its raw application of paint, turbulent brushwork, and striking color contrasts. The most prominent indicators are the vivid splashes of red and orange, particularly noticeable in the lower left quadrant and scattered throughout the composition. These fiery hues, typically associated with passion, heat, and aggression, appear almost like burning embers or explosive bursts against the dominant, somber palette of dark browns, greys, and deep blues. This visual 'heat' strongly evokes a sense of intensity and agitation linked to anger.

Furthermore, the heavily impastoed and unrefined brushstrokes contribute to a feeling of unrest and lack of control. The textured, almost chaotic surfaces suggest a turbulent emotional state, where energy is not smoothly contained but rather expressed with a forceful, almost agitated hand. While the overall mood is dark and somewhat oppressive, which could also suggest despair or melancholy, the intermittent flashes of vibrant red prevent the emotion from settling into mere sadness. Instead, these flashes suggest a simmering, perhaps even volatile, undercurrent of fury or intense frustration. The abstract nature means anger is conveyed through sensation and atmosphere rather than explicit facial expressions or actions, but the visual cues for an intense, possibly brooding, and occasionally eruptive anger are clearly present."
nature-rhythms-1950.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting exhibits no visual characteristics that would evoke or represent anger. The dominant color palette consists of warm, earthy tones such as various shades of brown, beige, and soft white or light blue. These colors are typically associated with nature, warmth, and tranquility, rather than agitation or hostility. Furthermore, the forms within the painting are organic, flowing, and undulating, characterized by smooth, curvilinear lines rather than sharp, jagged, or aggressive angles. There is a complete absence of harsh contrasts, violent movement, or chaotic fragmentation that might suggest conflict or emotional distress. The composition appears balanced and harmonious, lacking any elements that could be interpreted as tension, struggle, or discord. Without any figurative elements depicting expressions of anger or situations of conflict, and given the overall serene and fluid aesthetic, there is absolutely nothing in this artwork to elicit a feeling of anger."
mi-care-acvatic-1967.jpg,abstract,15.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. While there are some sharp, angular forms, particularly in the central diamond shape and the protruding elements on either side, which can sometimes be associated with aggression or confrontation, these are executed with a high degree of precision and control rather than explosive force or chaotic energy typically linked with anger. The most direct visual cue for anger, the color red, is used very sparingly and precisely, primarily as a thin outline around the central void, rather than a dominant, fiery expression. This serves more as an accent or a definition of space than an emotional outburst.

The overall color palette, dominated by muted greens, browns, and various shades of pink, is generally subdued and does not evoke the intensity or high energy often associated with rage. The background grid structure and the orderly layering of shapes contribute to a sense of intellectual contemplation or geometric exploration, which runs counter to the visceral, often uncontrolled nature of anger. There might be a subtle tension arising from the sharp contrasts and the sense of a confined or deep space within the central element, which could perhaps hint at a very internalized or suppressed frustration. However, this is a far cry from overt anger. The painting's meticulous composition and cool, analytical aesthetic keep any potential emotional heat at a very low level, making it difficult to strongly associate with feelings of anger."
modern-painting-with-clef-1967.jpg,abstract,72.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of intensity and forceful energy, aligning with aspects of anger, despite its abstract nature. The prominent use of bold, high-contrast colors, particularly the vibrant red and the deep, electric blue in the form of a lightning bolt on the right side, immediately registers as powerful and potentially aggressive. Red is universally associated with anger and passion, while the lightning bolt is a direct symbol of sudden, disruptive power and energy, akin to an angry outburst. The sharp, angular shapes, such as the zig-zag patterns and the defined edges of the various color blocks, contribute to a feeling of dynamism, abruptness, and even aggression. The overall composition is highly fragmented and energetic, creating a visual tension that can be interpreted as agitation or forceful emotion. The strong black outlines further amplify the directness and impact of these visual statements. While no explicit angry figure or scene is depicted, the visual language of stark contrasts, explosive shapes, and intense colors collectively conveys a palpable sense of potency and unyielding force that leans significantly towards the emotion of anger. The precision of the lines and dots might suggest a controlled intensity rather than chaotic rage, but the underlying emotion is one of strong, impactful feeling."
movement-in-white-umber-and-cobalt-green-1950.png,abstract,22.5,"The emotion of anger is present in this painting, though subtly and not as its dominant expression. Its presence stems primarily from the structural elements and dynamic fragmentation of the composition. The network of sharp, intersecting black lines creates a sense of tension and visual conflict, as if various planes and elements are clashing or being forced together in an angular, disjointed manner. This angularity, combined with the fragmented forms that appear to be shifting or breaking apart, can evoke a feeling of disquiet, friction, or underlying frustration. The absence of smooth transitions and the presence of abrupt visual shifts contribute to a sense of unease that can be a subtle facet of anger.

However, the manifestation of anger is significantly tempered by other aspects of the artwork. The color palette, composed of muted browns, subtle lavenders, and significant areas of white, lacks the intensity or harshness typically associated with strong anger (e.g., fiery reds, aggressive blacks). The brushstrokes, while visible and expressive in places, do not convey violent force or uncontrolled rage; they appear more deliberate, defining spaces and forms rather than expressing raw emotional outbursts. The overall dynamism feels more like an exploration of energetic forces or a deconstruction of space rather than an outpouring of fury. Therefore, while there's an intellectual tension and a sense of disruption that could be linked to an underlying frustration or agitation, the painting stops far short of conveying overt wrath, aggression, or explosive rage. The anger conveyed is more akin to a subdued, structural tension or a state of disquiet rather than a powerful emotional display."
miracles-of-evolution-africa-1977.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The visual elements within this painting offer extremely minimal, if any, support for an interpretation of anger. The dominant colors of lush green and vibrant yellow are typically associated with nature, growth, light, and vitality, rather than hostility or wrath. While there are subtle flecks of red and orange present, they are sparse, fragmented, and do not coalesce into a dominant or aggressive visual force that would evoke anger. Instead, they appear as incidental accents within the overwhelmingly verdant and luminous palette, perhaps suggesting light play or minor seasonal shifts in foliage.

The brushwork, though highly energetic and active, creating a dense, almost kaleidoscopic texture, does not convey violence, slashing aggression, or destructive chaos. Rather, the multitude of small, distinct strokes creates a sense of vibrant movement and intricate layering, akin to light filtering through a canopy or the bustling energy of a natural environment. There is"
not-detected-4.jpg,abstract,7.0,"The presence of the color red is the primary, if not sole, visual cue that could be associated with anger in this abstract composition. Red is a powerfully evocative color, frequently linked to intense emotions such as passion, urgency, and indeed, anger or aggression. The starkness of the red accents against the dominant white forms and dark backgrounds creates focal points of high contrast and visual energy, which could be interpreted as moments of heightened internal intensity.

However, the overall aesthetic of the painting significantly mitigates any direct sensation of anger. The primary shapes are large, smooth, and curvilinear, embodying a sense of fluidity and containment rather than jaggedness or explosive force that often characterizes expressions of rage. There are no sharp, clashing lines, chaotic arrangements, or dynamic movements that would suggest conflict or violent outburst. The red elements themselves, while bold, are integrated and contained within the larger white forms, appearing almost like internal organs or abstracted vital essences rather than outward, aggressive projections. The composition maintains a deliberate balance and stillness, which counteracts any potential for perceived turmoil or wrath. Consequently, while the red introduces a degree of intensity, it does not translate into a palpable feeling of anger; rather, it appears as a concentrated, perhaps passionate, internal energy that is held in check by the serene and stable surrounding forms."
not_detected_189365.jpg,abstract,88.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of anger through several key visual elements. Firstly, the predominant use of vibrant, high-saturation colors, especially the intense reds, oranges, and deep, almost bruised blues and greens, creates a visceral and clashing effect. Red is universally associated with anger and aggression, and its prominent placement alongside equally strong, often contrasting hues amplifies this feeling of friction and emotional intensity. Secondly, the raw, unrefined, and highly visible brushstrokes are thick, energetic, and appear to have been applied with considerable force and speed. These aggressive, almost violent strokes, often moving in sharp, diagonal directions, prevent any sense of calm or gentle flow, instead creating a dynamic tension that mirrors an agitated state. There's a palpable sense of an artist working with urgency and perhaps frustration. Thirdly, the abstract and fragmented composition contributes to the feeling of disorder and inner turmoil. There are no smooth lines or harmonious forms; instead, elements appear broken, skewed, and dislocated, much like thoughts or feelings in a state of anger. The dark, block-like shapes, which might vaguely suggest buildings, are stark and imposing, almost like obstacles or oppressive entities within the chaotic landscape. The overall effect is one of raw emotional expression, a forceful eruption of energy that feels confrontational and agitated, strongly aligning with the sensation of anger."
o32-60-1960.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. Its visual language is entirely devoid of elements typically associated with this emotion. The color palette, consisting of soft light blue/grey lines and a muted off-white background, is calm and soothing, offering no harsh contrasts or vibrant hues that might suggest aggression or irritation. The forms are clean, geometric, and balanced, featuring straight lines and a gentle curve, along with a perfectly round circle. There are no jagged edges, chaotic brushstrokes, or turbulent compositions that could convey frustration, tension, or fury. The overall arrangement feels spacious and harmonious, promoting a sense of tranquility and order rather than conflict or agitation. The minimalist and abstract nature of the work, combined with its serene aesthetic, places it at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum from anger."
not-detected-7.jpg,abstract,7.5,"The painting, an abstract composition of black, white, and gray forms, offers very few direct visual cues typically associated with anger. There is no presence of the color red, chaotic brushstrokes, aggressive imagery, or discernible figures expressing rage. The lines are remarkably clean and precise, suggesting control and order rather than explosive emotion.

However, a very subtle, almost intellectual, undercurrent of tension can be perceived in the dynamic interrelationship of the shapes, which could, for some viewers, resonate with a highly abstract sense of anger or frustration. The large, seemingly heavy gray form appears to press down or lean significantly upon the white form. This interaction creates a distinct sense of pressure or weight, as if one element is asserting dominance or exerting force upon another. The white form, in turn, with its sharp, angular ""elbow"" pointing outwards, might be interpreted as offering a subtle resistance or embodying a constrained tension. While the overall composition maintains a sense of sophisticated balance and structural integrity, this inherent push-and-pull between the forms can evoke a sensation of contained friction or an unyielding force encountering a resisting element. This dynamic, though highly controlled and devoid of any overt aggression, represents a very low-grade, abstract conflict or state of enduring pressure, which could be a precursor to or a subtle manifestation of suppressed anger for a viewer analyzing the interplay of forces."
niwiarki-1950.jpg,abstract,15.2,"The emotion of anger is very minimally evoked by this artwork. The muted color palette, dominated by cool blue-grey pencil on a neutral background, actively works against the visceral impact often associated with strong anger, which typically employs warmer, more intense hues like reds or stark contrasts.

The lines in the drawing are predominantly curvilinear, undulating, and organic. While they sometimes tangle or form ambiguous, somewhat claw-like shapes (particularly in the lower sections, which could be interpreted as struggling hands), they lack the sharp, aggressive, or chaotic quality that overtly conveys rage or violent intent. These forms seem more to suggest internal turmoil, a sense of being lost, or a gentle, perhaps melancholic, flow rather than an explosive outburst of emotion.

There are no clear visual cues of overt anger such as"
nova-aurigae-1918.jpg,abstract,98.0,"The depiction of anger in this painting is exceptionally strong and visceral. The central figure's face is distorted and contorted, characteristic of intense rage. The eyebrows are heavily furrowed and pulled downward, casting a shadow or giving a fierce glare to the eyes, which appear wide and piercing. The mouth is downturned in a grimace or snarl, suggesting a vocal expression of displeasure or a silent scream of fury. The jawline is tense and angular, indicating a clenched jaw often associated with suppressed or erupting anger.

Beyond the facial features, the surrounding elements amplify this emotion. Chaotic, jagged forms resembling flames or explosive energy erupt from and around the figure's head, predominantly in fiery reds, oranges, and dark tones. These colors are traditionally linked to passion, aggression, and the heat of anger. The turbulent, swirling lines and streaks across the composition, especially the vibrant reds and yellows, contribute to a dynamic sense of violent movement and uncontrolled emotional discharge, like an emotional storm or eruption. The entire atmosphere of the painting feels charged with an overwhelming, explosive intensity, strongly conveying an advanced state of fury or wrath."
orange-1923.jpg,abstract,35.0,"The emotion of anger in this artwork is subtly suggested rather than overtly expressed, earning it a moderate-low score. The primary contributors to this feeling are the sharp, pointed lines and triangular forms that pierce and intersect throughout the composition, particularly the dominant, long black diagonal line that slices across the canvas. These sharp elements evoke a sense of aggression, cutting, or forceful impact. The fragmented and dynamic arrangement of shapes, especially within the central cluster, creates a feeling of tension and perhaps a controlled explosion, which can be associated with agitated or internal conflict – aspects often linked to anger. The use of darker, more earthy tones (like the deep red/burnt orange and black) within this dynamic core adds a certain weight and intensity. However, the overall intellectual and abstract nature of the piece, combined with its clean lines and precise forms, prevents the anger from feeling raw, chaotic, or visceral. There's no sense of uncontrolled rage or destructive fury; instead, any implied aggression feels calculated and contained within the composition's meticulous structure. The lack of vibrant, fiery reds or chaotic brushstrokes further dampens a strong association with explosive anger, leaving it as a simmering undercurrent of tension and assertive force."
orange-violet-1935.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract composition, I find absolutely no visual cues that would evoke or represent the emotion of anger. The painting, characterized by its clear, defined geometric forms, clean lines, and distinct color planes, conveys a sense of balance, dynamism, and perhaps even intellectual playfulness or musicality. There are no aggressive brushstrokes, no chaotic or jarring juxtapositions of form or color, and no oppressive darkness that might suggest rage or turmoil. The various elements, though abstract, appear to be in harmonious interaction, creating a visually organized and almost serene experience rather than one of discord or aggression. The overall impression is one of thoughtful composition and controlled energy, entirely devoid of any visual language associated with anger."
paesaggio-cosmico-1934.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting, an abstract composition, offers very little to evoke or represent anger. The dominant black background contributes to a sense of depth or void rather than a specific strong emotion like anger. The various colored elements – glowing green and white streaks, bright blue and yellow areas, and distinct shapes like the black organic form and the bottle-like cutout – are rendered with a smooth, almost airbrushed technique that creates a feeling of serenity, cosmic movement, or futuristic design. There are no harsh, jagged lines, violent textures, or chaotic compositions that might be associated with rage or frustration. The lines, while dynamic and diagonal, suggest trajectory or ethereal light rather than aggression. The scattered dots and circles feel like celestial bodies or particles, maintaining a detached, observational quality. The overall aesthetic is one of calm, precise execution and contemplative abstraction, which stands in stark contrast to the visual characteristics often used to convey anger in art, such as clashing colors, distorted forms, or explosive energy. Therefore, the presence of anger in this artwork is negligible."
paris-abstract.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting, an abstract composition, employs a palette of vibrant colors—oranges, yellows, purples, and greens—set against a deep black background. While some of these colors, particularly certain shades of orange, can sometimes carry an energetic or intense connotation, in this specific context, they appear more harmonious and dynamic than aggressive. The shapes are a mix of geometric planes and soft, flowing curves, intersecting and layering in a way that suggests motion and depth, rather than violent collision or fragmentation. There are no sharp, jagged lines that evoke a sense of tearing or aggression, nor are there chaotic, turbulent forms that might suggest an outburst of rage. The overall composition feels carefully balanced and deliberate, even with its sense of movement. There is no visual tension or discord that would typically be associated with anger, such as clashing colors used to create discomfort, distorted or broken forms, or an overwhelming sense of confinement or frustration. The black background, while creating strong contrast, primarily serves to highlight the colored forms rather than to imbue the scene with a sense of darkness or oppression. The work seems to invite contemplation of form and color interplay, rather than eliciting a strong emotional reaction like anger. A very low score is appropriate as there is almost nothing in the visual language of this piece that directly communicates or evokes anger."
parque-de-s-paulo-1996.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting largely evokes a sense of dynamism, abstraction, and vibrant energy rather than anger. The upper section, depicting an abstracted city skyline with strong vertical and curved lines in blues and white, feels somewhat stark and perhaps a bit industrial, but not inherently angry. There's no sense of destruction, chaos, or oppressive force that might suggest anger from the urban environment.

The lower section, characterized by swirling, organic forms in a rich palette of reds, yellows, blues, greens, and purples, conveys movement and fluidity. While the swirling shapes are energetic, they lack the sharp, aggressive angles, violent contrasts, or clashing elements typically associated with anger. The colors, though bold, are not jarring or unsettling in a way that would provoke an angry response; instead, they appear to flow harmoniously. There are no dark, brooding tones or harsh, fractured lines that might imply rage or conflict. The overall impression is one of visual complexity and rhythmic motion, which is far removed from the emotional intensity of anger. A very low score is assigned because while the abstract nature doesn't explicitly negate anger, it offers no visual language cues to support it. The slight allowance (5 instead of 0) acknowledges the potential for individual subjective interpretation of very abstract forms, but there's nothing concrete to anchor anger to."
painterly-architectonic-3.jpg,abstract,75.0,"The painting powerfully evokes a sense of anger through its aggressive geometric abstraction and dynamic composition. The most striking element contributing to this emotion is the pervasive use of sharp, angular forms, particularly the large, dominant black triangle that dramatically cuts through the center of the canvas. This form, along with other stark diagonals and pointed shapes, creates a visual language of thrust, collision, and penetration, mirroring the forceful and impactful nature of anger.

The choice of colors further amplifies this feeling. The deep, almost oppressive black contrasts sharply with the vibrant blues, greens, and touches of red and orange, creating a jarring and confrontational palette. This lack of gentle blending or harmonious transitions suggests a state of tension and discord. The bright white and light grey elements, while providing contrast, also contribute to the sharpness of the edges, making the forms feel unyielding and unsoftened.

The overall dynamism of the composition, with shapes appearing to be in constant, energetic motion or collision, adds to the sense of an unleashed or unresolved force. There's an absence of serenity or softness; instead, the precision and starkness of the geometric forms lend a calculated yet potent intensity, akin to controlled fury or an impactful assertion of will. The painting feels assertive and uncompromising, directly confronting the viewer with its stark, clashing elements, which aligns strongly with an experience of anger."
painterly-architectonic.jpg,abstract,68.5,"The painting evokes a palpable sense of anger primarily through its aggressive use of sharp, angular, and fragmented geometric forms. These acute angles and pointed edges feel as if they are cutting, piercing, or colliding within the frame, creating a visual language of tension and impact. The dynamic diagonal lines further amplify this feeling, suggesting forceful movement, rupture, and a lack of stability, reminiscent of the volatile energy associated with anger.

The color palette, while not dominated by traditional ""angry"" reds, contributes significantly to this emotional resonance through stark contrasts. The vibrant, almost jarring oranges and yellows clash sharply against the deep, somber blacks and blues, creating visual friction and an unsettling intensity. This strong opposition of light and dark, and warm versus cool tones, prevents any sense of harmony or calm, instead fostering an environment of agitation and discord.

There is a distinct absence of soft, organic, or blending forms; instead, the rigid, broken planes appear to be in a state of disarray or confrontation. This fragmentation and the chaotic interplay of shapes suggest a breakdown or conflict, aligning with the disruptive and unsettling nature of anger. The overall impression is one of forceful energy, visual aggression, and a profound lack of repose, directly connecting to the feeling of being agitated or in a state of simmering fury."
pera-1986.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting is an abstract, geometric composition characterized by flat, bold colors and stylized forms that evoke a cityscape or architectural elements. There are absolutely no visual cues within the artwork that suggest or elicit anger. The color palette, while containing strong contrasts like dark blue and bright yellow, does not convey aggression; rather, the yellow adds a sense of vibrancy and the light blues and pinks introduce a softer, almost playful touch. The shapes are clean, geometric, and organized, lacking any jagged, chaotic, or sharp elements that might imply conflict, violence, or aggression. There are no depicted figures expressing rage, nor are there any scenes of destruction, confrontation, or tension. The overall impression is one of structured design, perhaps a stylized whimsy, or simply a decorative exploration of form and color, entirely devoid of any agitated or hostile sentiment."
painting-on-light-ground-1916.jpg,abstract,18.5,"While Wassily Kandinsky's ""Composition VII"" is undeniably a powerful and dynamic work, a direct sensation of anger is not its primary emotional impact. The painting's abstract forms are characterized by intense movement, swirling shapes, and a complex interplay of lines and colors, often interpreted as representing cosmic upheaval, spiritual awakening, or an apocalyptic vision.

Elements that might subtly hint at tension or conflict, potentially related to anger, include:
*   **Jagged and sharp forms:** Particularly in the upper sections and some of the darker, more fragmented areas, there are sharp angles and pointed shapes that could suggest aggression or friction.
*   **Darker tones and strong contrasts:** Certain dark patches and the stark contrast between some colors can create a sense of unease or intensity, which might be associated with a volatile emotion.
*   **Overwhelming dynamism and chaos:** The sheer density and interwoven nature of the forms create a sense of energetic turmoil that could be overwhelming or even disorienting, sometimes leading to feelings of frustration or agitation in an observer.

However, these elements do not coalesce into a dominant feeling of anger for several reasons:
*   **Lack of direct representation:** As an abstract work, there are no specific figures or actions that convey anger. The feeling would have to be purely evoked by formal elements.
*   **Diverse color palette:** While there are reds and dark tones that can signify passion or aggression, the painting also features vibrant yellows, blues, greens, and lighter hues. This wide range of colors introduces complexity and often balances out any singular aggressive mood. The reds, for instance, are often integrated into larger, more fluid movements rather than isolated as aggressive bursts.
*   **Fluidity and organic shapes:** Interspersed with the jagged elements are many rounded, flowing, and organic forms, particularly around the central vortex. These softer shapes counterbalance the sharpness, suggesting a broader cycle of creation and destruction rather than pure rage.
*   **Interpretive context:** ""Composition VII"" is often seen as a depiction of the destructive and regenerative forces of the universe, a spiritual journey, or the ""inner necessity"" of art. The energy feels more akin to a cosmic force or transformative process than human-centric anger. The ""chaos"" is often a prelude to a new order, carrying a sense of profound significance rather than simple fury.

Overall, any potential for anger is diluted by the painting's overwhelming complexity, spiritual undertones, and the balance of its formal elements. The emotion is closer to intense dynamism, spiritual struggle, or profound transformation rather than targeted rage."
pasture-1958.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The artwork, a woven textile piece, predominantly features a muted, earthy green hue. This color is generally associated with nature, tranquility, or growth, and does not inherently carry connotations of anger. Accents of burnt orange, white, and black are interspersed throughout the intricate pattern. While black can sometimes imply darkness or negativity, and orange can be energetic, their application here is as small, fragmented elements within a structured, repetitive composition, rather than as dominant, aggressive forces.

The composition itself is highly geometric and ordered, characterized by countless small, repeated woven units. This meticulousness and repetition lend a sense of patience and craftsmanship to the piece, which is contrary to the chaotic or explosive energy often associated with anger. There are no sharp, jagged lines, clashing contrasts, or overtly aggressive forms that would visually translate to rage or fury.

Any perception of ""anger"" would be extremely minimal and highly indirect. One might, at a stretch, interpret the dense, 'static-like' visual texture created by the small, scattered patterns as subtly overwhelming or creating a minor visual 'noise,' which *could* lead to a fleeting sensation of irritation or discomfort in some viewers. However, this mild irritation is a far cry from the potent, aggressive emotion of anger. The overall impression remains one of intricate detail and contained complexity rather than emotional outburst or confrontation. The piece evokes a feeling closer to contemplation or perhaps a subtle visual hum, not the strong, fiery presence of anger."
peaky-forms-1923.jpg,abstract,78.5,"The painting strongly evokes anger through several distinct visual elements. Firstly, the prominent use of vibrant, intense reds and fiery oranges, particularly in the central and upper-left sections, immediately resonates with associations of heat, passion, and rage. These colors are often direct symbolic representations of anger or heightened emotional states.

Secondly, the forms and shapes within the composition are sharp, angular, and often thrust upward, reminiscent of jagged peaks or erupting flames. This lack of softness or curvilinear flow contributes to a sense of assertiveness, intensity, and potential aggression. The visual friction created by these pointed forms pushing against each other or against the surrounding space directly mirrors the internal or external tension characteristic of anger.

Thirdly, the brushwork is vigorous, visible, and directional, conveying a powerful and dynamic force. The strokes appear uninhibited and almost forceful, suggesting an agitated energy that aligns with the expressive and often turbulent nature of anger. The raw application of paint prevents any sense of calm or tranquility, reinforcing the presence of strong emotion.

Finally, the overall composition, with its strong contrasts between bright and dark colors (e.g., yellows against deep blues and dark browns), creates a visual discord and tension. The dark, heavy, almost tree-like vertical elements disrupt the flow of the vibrant hues, adding a sense of weight, brooding intensity, or even resistance, which can be part of a profound angry experience. While abstract, the forceful interplay of clashing colors and aggressive forms communicates a powerful emotional charge that aligns strongly with the attributes of anger."
picture-with-a-black-arch-1912.jpg,abstract,68.0,"The painting evokes a notable degree of anger through its vibrant and assertive use of color and form. The prominent display of bold red hues, particularly the vivid red circle and the large red shape on the right, directly contributes to this sensation, as red is widely associated with strong emotions such as passion, intensity, and anger. This color doesn't recede but rather demands attention, suggesting a forceful emotional presence.

Complementing the impactful reds are the sharp, dark, and often angular lines that cut across the canvas. These lines possess a decisive, almost aggressive quality, reminiscent of sharp movements or sudden, forceful disruptions. Their crisscrossing and intertwining nature creates a sense of tension and conflict, as if opposing forces are clashing or competing for dominance within the frame.

Furthermore, the large, abstract forms within the composition, such as the weighty brown/maroon shape and the expansive green mass, appear to be interacting with a certain degree of friction or confrontation. They don't blend seamlessly but rather assert their presence against one another, implying a powerful, perhaps agitated, interplay. The overall dynamism and high energy of the composition, marked by these interacting shapes and energetic lines, suggest an agitated state rather than one of serenity or calm. While abstract, this intense visual language can be interpreted as embodying the raw, unbridled energy often associated with anger or a forceful emotional outburst. It's not a subtle or suppressed anger, but one that is actively expressed through the powerful visual elements."
planos-de-color-con-dos-maderas-superpuestas-1928.jpg,abstract,3.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this artwork. The primary reason for any faint association with anger stems from the prominent use of red, a color culturally linked to intense emotions, including rage or passion. There are two significant red rectangular blocks and a segment within the central circular element. However, this association is severely diluted and almost entirely neutralized by several other compositional and stylistic elements. The painting is characterized by its strict geometric abstraction, employing straight lines, right angles, and a circle. This ordered, rational structure provides a strong sense of balance and stability, directly counteracting any potential volatility or agitation that red might otherwise suggest. The composition is calm and contained, lacking the sharp, jagged forms or chaotic brushstrokes often associated with expressions of anger. Furthermore, the red is balanced by large areas of black, which provide a grounding and heavy presence, and by the cool, serene blue and neutral white, which act as calming counterpoints. The overall impression is one of deliberate compositional study and formal exploration rather than an emotional outburst. The texture, while rough and showing visible brushwork, conveys a handmade quality rather than violent application. There is no narrative, figure, or implied action that would suggest conflict or agitation. Consequently, while a very subtle, almost subliminal connection might be made due to the color red, the overwhelming formal qualities of the piece render it virtually devoid of any tangible expression of anger."
red-and-blue-layers-1954.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork, a woven textile, exhibits a highly structured and repetitive pattern composed of distinct horizontal bands and recurring circular motifs. This meticulous organization and rhythmic repetition inherently convey a sense of order, balance, and calm, which are antithetical to the chaotic or agitated feelings associated with anger. The color palette, consisting of vibrant blues, oranges, and pinks, while bold and contrasting, is also harmonious and visually pleasing rather than jarring or aggressive. There are no sharp lines, turbulent forms, or discordant color combinations that might evoke a sense of frustration, hostility, or aggression. The tactile nature of the textile and its intricate craftsmanship suggest a meticulous and deliberate creation, further reinforcing a feeling of aesthetic tranquility and craftsmanship, leaving no room for the emotion of anger to be perceived."
plumen-1957.jpg,abstract,18.0,"The emotion of anger is present in this painting, but at a very low and subdued level. The most direct visual cues for anger, such as the color red or fiery orange, appear only in very small, isolated patches amidst a vast expanse of dark and cool tones (black, deep blue, purple, teal). These sparse highlights act like tiny, contained embers or faint warnings, suggesting a fleeting spark or a deeply suppressed, simmering irritation rather than an active outburst of rage.

The dominant black and dark shapes are heavy and amorphous, lacking the sharp, jagged edges or aggressive thrusts typically associated with visual expressions of anger. Instead, their rounded, organic forms evoke a sense of weighty density or a brooding, internal state. While this might imply a feeling of being weighed down or perhaps a source of frustration, it does not translate into dynamic or explosive anger. There is no sense of violent movement, conflict, or overt aggression in the composition. The overall impression is more one of somberness, density, or quiet mystery, with anger being a barely perceptible undertone, like a distant, muffled rumble rather than a direct confrontation."
rebuilding-the-tower-2009.jpg,abstract,88.0,"The emotion of anger is powerfully evoked in this painting through a combination of color, symbolic forms, and explicit textual context. The most striking element is the pervasive, deep crimson-red background, a color universally associated with intense emotions, including rage, violence, and conflict. This is not a warm, inviting red, but a heavy, almost blood-like hue that saturates the composition. Further amplifying this, jagged, sharp red and orange shapes erupt into the frame from the right side, resembling violent splashes, breaking fragments, or fiery outbursts, directly conveying aggression and rupture.

The central monolithic figure, with its distressed, scratched, and textured surfaces, suggests wear, damage, or the harsh impact of historical forces. It appears almost like a shattered monument or a figure bearing the scars of conflict. This visual deterioration, coupled with the explicit title ""Contemporary History of the World: The Rise and Fall of Empires"" (visible in the upper left), anchors the emotion of anger firmly in the context of grand-scale human struggle, war, and the injustice inherent in the cycles of power and destruction. The ""fall of empires"" directly implies devastation, loss, and the violent overthrow or collapse of systems, all potent sources of anger. The overall composition creates a sense of weighty, historical indignation and a simmering rage at the persistent themes of conflict and destruction throughout human history. The intensity of the color and the implied violence of the shapes leave little room for other interpretations regarding the presence of anger."
presence-of-a-memory.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. There is a notable absence of visual cues typically associated with strong anger, such as vibrant, aggressive colors like fiery reds or harsh, clashing oranges. The dominant palette of muted browns, deep blues, blacks, and grays tends to evoke a sense of solemnity, depth, or perhaps melancholy rather than an active, outward expression of rage or frustration.

While the painting features some rough textures, particularly on the left vertical element, and fragmented or somewhat distressed forms, these elements do not translate into agitated or violent brushstrokes that would convey an angry outburst. Instead, the textures feel more weathered or architectural, suggesting a history or a state of being rather than a volatile emotion. The composition, characterized by strong vertical and horizontal lines and a large, deep black void, creates a sense of structure, weight, and perhaps mystery or emptiness, which does not inherently align with the dynamic or chaotic energy often associated with anger. There is no sense of explosion, confrontation, or aggressive visual movement. Any tension present feels more like quiet gravity or internal contemplation rather than a simmering or expressed rage."
rencontre-sur-une-plage.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The visual language of this painting offers remarkably little to evoke or represent anger. The palette, dominated by rich, earthy browns and deep, almost velvety blacks, along with a serene grey, tends to create a somber or contemplative atmosphere rather than one of fiery emotion. While accents of vibrant blue and a deep magenta exist, they are integrated as contained geometric segments within the larger forms, serving more as compositional elements or points of interest than as explosive expressions of rage. Anger in art often manifests through sharp, jagged lines, aggressive brushwork, or a chaotic, dissonant composition. None of these characteristics are present here. The forms are predominantly rounded, smooth, and deliberately placed, suggesting a sense of stillness and balance. There is no visual tension that escalates into aggression, no dynamic clash of shapes, and no agitated movement that would typically communicate fury. Even the mask-like face on the right, with its hollowed eyes and simple mouth, conveys an enigmatic or perhaps melancholic quality rather than one of wrath or indignation. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation or abstract arrangement, entirely devoid of the visual cues that signify anger."
selam-trilogy.jpg,abstract,5.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. The overall composition is characterized by fragmented, mosaic-like shapes and a predominantly dark, somber color palette of blues, greys, and muted yellows. While the darkness and fragmentation could potentially hint at underlying tension or a fragmented state of being, these elements do not directly or strongly translate to anger. There are no dynamic or aggressive brushstrokes, nor any discernible features on the abstract figures that would convey rage, hostility, or agitation. The figures appear static, almost architectural, and lack any posture or expression indicative of an aggressive emotional state. There are no vibrant reds, harsh contrasts, or chaotic movements typically associated with the emotion of anger. The atmosphere evokes more of a contemplative, introspective, or perhaps melancholic mood rather than one of conflict or outrage. Any presence of anger would be extremely subtle and indirect, perhaps stemming from a highly abstract interpretation of the fragmented forms as representing internal struggle, but it is certainly not an overt or dominant emotion conveyed by the artwork."
sea-1959.jpg,abstract,38.0,"The painting exhibits an underlying current of tension and turbulence, particularly within its darker, lower registers, which contributes to a moderate sense of unease that can subtly align with the feeling of anger. The chaotic, swirling forms and the visual contrast between the seemingly stable, gridded upper portion and the disturbed, almost fragmented lower half create a sense of disruption and unresolved struggle. The scattered horizontal reddish-orange lines throughout the darker areas introduce a subtle element of friction or intensity, reminiscent of a simmering discomfort or agitated energy. However, the anger portrayed is far from overt or explosive. There are no harsh, aggressive lines or dominant, fiery reds that typically signify rage. Instead, the darkness tends to absorb and contain much of the emotional intensity, suggesting a more internalized or suppressed form of agitation rather than an outward expression of fury. The overall impression is one of unsettled introspection rather than active aggression, placing the feeling of anger at a perceptible but not dominating level."
runner-1934.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no characteristics typically associated with the emotion of anger. There are no sharp, jagged, or explosive forms that would suggest aggression or rage. The black, organic shapes, while bold and possessing a certain weight, do not convey hostility or violent energy. Their movement appears more fluid and symbolic, perhaps indicating separation or evolution, rather than a forceful, angry outburst. The earthy, ochre background is warm and grounding, offering no visual cues for irritation or fury. There are no agitated brushstrokes or dynamic compositions that would imply conflict or intense emotional turmoil linked to anger. Overall, the visual language of the piece is far removed from any expression of anger."
small-pleasures-1913.jpg,abstract,68.5,"The emotion of anger is conveyed through several abstract elements in this painting, contributing to a sense of agitation and forceful energy. The prominent use of vibrant, ""hot"" colors, particularly the intense reds and oranges that dominate the central and upper right sections, evokes a fiery and passionate intensity often associated with anger's explosive nature. These colors are not used harmoniously but rather appear to burst forth and clash.

Furthermore, the highly dynamic and somewhat chaotic composition, characterized by sharp, jagged lines and fragmented forms, suggests a state of tension and disquiet. There's a distinct lack of calm or stable elements; instead, forms seem to collide and overlap with vigorous, almost violent, energy. The upward-surging central mass, with its red speckles, can be interpreted as an eruption or a forceful release of emotion. The general sense of visual ""noise"" and the fragmented, non-representational nature of the forms prevent any feeling of peace or resolution, instead creating an atmosphere of restless energy and internal turmoil that aligns with the agitated aspects of anger. While not depicting explicit rage or aggression, the painting's powerful motion, clashing visual elements, and intense color palette cumulatively evoke a significant degree of forceful, perhaps uncontrolled, emotional output that can be strongly interpreted as anger."
study-for-improvisation-8-1909.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting, characteristic of Kandinsky's early abstract work, utilizes a vibrant palette of yellow, orange, green, blue, and red. While red can often be associated with anger, in this composition, it appears within a rainbow-like arc at the top, contributing to a sense of dynamism rather than aggression. The predominant yellows and oranges convey warmth and energy, while the blues and greens suggest tranquility and nature. The forms are fluid and organic, with sweeping lines and rounded shapes, which do not evoke sharpness, tension, or conflict. There are no harsh, jagged lines, chaotic brushstrokes, or clashing colors that would signify rage or turmoil. The abstracted figures, though simplified, do not display any expressions or postures indicative of anger; rather, their forms appear integrated within the vibrant, flowing landscape. The overall visual rhythm feels more like an upward spiritual journey or an unfolding of harmonious elements, leaving very little room for an interpretation of anger."
small-table-upper-surface-1920.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The visual elements within this painting offer almost no discernible cues to evoke the emotion of anger. The forms are predominantly organic, curvilinear, and soft, lacking the sharp angles, jagged edges, or aggressive lines typically associated with rage or conflict. There are no elements that suggest explosive energy, violent motion, or destructive force. While shades of red are present, they lean towards earthy, terracotta, or muted brick tones rather than vibrant, aggressive scarlet or clashing hues. The overall color palette is harmonious and warm, creating a sense of calm or gentle movement rather than discord or intensity. The composition flows smoothly from one element to another, contributing to a feeling of balance and tranquility, entirely devoid of tension or confrontation. There are no agitated brushstrokes or chaotic arrangements that might convey frustration or fury. The presence of large, grounded circles and undulating lines further reinforces a sense of stability and peaceful progression, which stands in direct opposition to the visual language of anger. Any interpretation of anger would be an extreme stretch of subjective projection onto an objectively placid and abstract composition."
not_detected_189367.jpg,abstract,60.5,"The painting evokes a notable degree of anger through several distinct visual elements. Foremost is the presence of sharp, angular shapes, particularly the prominent red zigzag form on the right, which conveys a sense of abruptness, tension, and a swift, almost aggressive, energy. This shape, along with the other red triangles, brings to mind bursts of frustration or sharp, pointed agitation. The overall composition, with its strong black and white contrasts and the converging striped patterns on the left and right ""walls,"" creates a sensation of being constrained or funneled, which can be a source of intense frustration and anger. Furthermore, the grid-like structure of thin black lines on the left side of the central white panel strongly resembles bars or a cage, visually representing restriction and confinement—a common catalyst for anger. While the painting maintains a highly ordered and structured aesthetic, preventing a feeling of chaotic rage, the underlying tension, the sharpness of specific forms, and the implication of restriction contribute significantly to an emotional response leaning towards irritation, frustration, or contained anger. The precision of the lines and shapes suggests a more intellectualized or internalized anger, rather than an uncontrolled outburst, but the symbolic elements are potent in their suggestion of this emotion."
spiral-motif-in-white-black-and-indigo-1951.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The visual elements in this abstract painting offer very minimal, almost negligible, cues that could be associated with anger. Anger is typically conveyed through sharp, jagged, or aggressive lines, explosive forms, high-contrast or clashing colors (often including reds or deep blacks), and a sense of destructive energy or tension.

This painting features swirling, organic lines that, while dynamic and suggesting movement (like water currents, wind patterns, or wood grain), are flowing and curvilinear rather than sharp, violent, or fragmented. The color palette is composed of muted blues, whites, and earthy browns, which are generally calming or natural rather than evoking intense emotion or aggression. There is no sense of violent rupture, collision, or chaotic destruction in the composition. While the texture has a somewhat rough or ""distressed"" quality, this translates more to an organic, weathered, or perhaps"
the-big-wheel-1970.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting by Alexander Calder primarily uses a bold palette of primary colors (red, yellow, blue) along with black and white, characteristic of his abstract, often playful style. While red can sometimes be associated with anger or passion, in this context, its vibrancy contributes more to a sense of energy and dynamism rather than hostility or rage. The forms are predominantly curvilinear and swirling, emanating from a central white circle. These soft, flowing lines and organic shapes suggest movement, perhaps like a pinwheel or a stylized flower, which evokes a feeling of gentle motion and visual harmony rather than aggression or tension. There are no sharp, jagged angles, chaotic composition, or dark, oppressive elements that would typically convey anger. The black outlines serve to define the cheerful, fluid shapes rather than creating a sense of foreboding or harshness. The overall impression is one of visual balance, vitality, and perhaps whimsy, largely devoid of any emotional characteristics commonly linked to anger or distress. Therefore, any perceived anger would be minimal, if at all present, superseded by feelings of vibrancy and fluidity."
tennis-1933.jpg,abstract,5.0,"My assessment of anger in this painting yields a very low score due to the complete absence of visual cues typically associated with this emotion. The artwork features biomorphic, fluid shapes that convey a sense of organic movement and transformation rather than aggressive energy or tension. There are no sharp, jagged lines or violent brushstrokes that might suggest an outburst or internal struggle. The dominant forms are curvilinear and soft, lacking the rigidity or distortion often used to depict rage or frustration.

The color palette, consisting of earthy tones, muted greys, a subdued terracotta, and stark white, does not contain the vibrant, clashing, or fiery hues (like intense reds or oranges used aggressively) that often signify anger. The black section, while dark, functions more as a deep, mysterious background or void, rather than an oppressive or furious element.

Furthermore, the overall composition is balanced and possesses a dreamlike, surreal quality. There's a certain quietude or introspective mood, possibly even a melancholic undertone, but absolutely no indication of hostility, aggression, or a turbulent emotional state. The figures, if interpreted as such, appear to be in a state of dissolution or contemplation, their forms yielding and flowing, which is contrary to the hardened, explosive nature of anger. There's no sense of confrontation, destruction, or physical force. Consequently, the painting does not evoke or express anger in any discernible way."
tapestry-1948.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork, appearing to be a textile piece or a painting inspired by weaving, presents a highly structured and textural composition. The dominant colors are muted tones of black, various shades of brown/tan, and off-white/light grey. These colors are earthy and subdued, lacking the intensity or clashing qualities often associated with anger, such as vibrant reds, harsh yellows, or aggressive dark contrasts. The piece is composed primarily of straight horizontal and vertical lines, forming a grid-like pattern with varying densities and block-like shapes. While intricate, these lines are orderly and precise, completely devoid of the jagged, chaotic, or aggressive strokes that might convey fury or agitation. There are no distorted forms, sharp edges, or confrontational elements within the composition that would evoke feelings of hostility or aggression. The overall visual impression is one of meticulous craftsmanship, stability, and perhaps a quiet contemplation of texture and structure, rather than any form of emotional outburst or conflict. Therefore, there are no discernible visual cues that would suggest or evoke anger."
study-for-space-1966.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The visual elements in this abstract composition present a very minimal and highly contained sense of what might be distantly related to anger. The primary reasons for this low score stem from the presence of sharp, angular lines and occasional zig-zag patterns, which introduce a degree of visual tension and a departure from smooth, flowing forms that typically convey serenity. Specifically, the sharp intersections of lines and the irregular paths of some elements, like the prominent white zig-zag in the upper right quadrant, could subtly suggest friction or an agitated energy. Furthermore, the small areas of dense black cross-hatching, particularly noticeable in the upper right and lower left, create a visual texture that could be interpreted as constricted or slightly agitated, a very faint echo of internal friction.

However, these elements are not pronounced enough to evoke strong anger. The overall muted color palette (dominated by gray-purple, light blue, white, and brown) lacks the aggressive vibrancy often associated with rage (e.g., strong reds). The lines, while angular, appear controlled and deliberate rather than chaotic or explosive, suggesting a structured abstraction rather than an emotional outburst. There is no sense of violence, disruption, or overwhelming frustration. Any perceived ""anger"" is thus extremely subtle, akin to a quiet, almost intellectualized sense of disquiet or a barely perceptible underlying tension, far from any overt emotional expression of fury or rage. It registers as a very distant resonance of potential agitation, meticulously contained within the artistic framework."
the-alibi-allotrope-1970.jpg,abstract,68.5,"The painting evokes a palpable sense of internal turmoil and discord, which can be strongly associated with anger. The composition is fragmented and unbalanced, with sharp, jagged forms and intersecting lines that suggest a clash or disruption. On the left, sweeping, almost violent strokes, particularly the dark, claw-like elements and the sharp, bright lines, convey a raw, nervous energy. These elements create a feeling of agitation and tension, much like a suppressed or simmering rage.

The prominent use of dark, heavy masses, especially on the right side, contributes to a brooding and oppressive atmosphere. This dense, almost suffocating presence can be interpreted as a source of frustration or an overwhelming burden, which commonly leads to feelings of anger. The contrasting lighter areas appear almost shattered or broken, with sharp white shards emerging from the gloom, further emphasizing a sense of rupture or internal conflict.

Crucially, the vibrant magenta/pink lines that cut across the canvas, appearing almost like frenetic scribbles or deep gashes, inject a distinct element of aggressive energy and emotional intensity. While not overtly violent in a literal sense, their sharp trajectory and disruptive placement within the otherwise muted palette hint at a forceful, almost cutting emotional outpouring. The lack of traditional calming elements and the prevalence of these unsettling forms and colors prevent any sense of peace, instead leaving an impression of unresolved tension and a volatile emotional landscape that strongly resonates with the experience of anger."
the-letter-scale-1923.jpg,abstract,5.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. The dominant background color, a reddish-brown or terracotta, might subtly hint at tones associated with warmth or even passion, which in more saturated forms could lead to anger. However, this particular shade is muted and earthy, lacking the fiery intensity often linked to rage. The geometric and precise nature of the composition, with its clean lines, circles, and rectangular forms, suggests order and intellectual contemplation rather than chaotic aggression or emotional upheaval. The shapes, while abstract, also include what appears to be a stylized swan or bird-like figure, which typically evokes grace and serenity, counteracting any potential feeling of harshness. There are no jagged edges, clashing colors, or dynamic, explosive forms that would convey a sense of frustration, violence, or direct anger. The overall impression is one of calculated design and quiet balance, offering little to provoke or reflect anger in the viewer. The minimal score acknowledges the very faint, almost subconscious association of red tones with intense emotion, but this is overwhelmingly offset by the painting's calm, organized, and intellectual aesthetic."
sur-fond-gris-n-10-1963.jpg,abstract,35.5,"The emotion of anger in this artwork is not overtly expressed in a traditional sense, but rather subtly conveyed through the formal elements of the geometric abstract composition. There is no figurative representation of anger, nor are there typically ""angry"" colors like vibrant reds or oranges dominating the canvas. However, a specific kind of tension, rigidity, and visual friction can evoke a sense of controlled or structural anger."
the-purple-morning-1996.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting registers an extremely low score for anger. There are virtually no visual elements present that would evoke or symbolize this emotion. The color palette, while including muted reds (which can be associated with anger), utilizes them in earthy, warm tones rather than fiery, aggressive, or clashing hues. These reds appear as part of a varied, organic backdrop or as the color of some of the abstract forms, contributing to a sense of warmth or natural sedimentation rather than rage or agitation.

Furthermore, the shapes are predominantly rounded, organic, and soft, with no sharp angles, jagged edges, or explosive forms typically indicative of anger. Many of the shapes feature concentric patterns or intricate grid-like textures that suggest introspection, calm, or a meditative state, rather than emotional turmoil or outburst. The overall composition is harmonious and still, lacking any dynamic tension, chaotic arrangement, or violent movement that would convey anger. There are no aggressive brushstrokes, no clashing contrasts designed to jar the viewer, and no narrative elements that could imply conflict or fury. The pervasive feeling is one of quietude, abstract contemplation, or organic growth, making any interpretation of anger highly unlikely. The score of 1.5 accounts for the mere presence of reddish hues, which are broadly associated with the emotion, but acknowledges that their specific application and the overwhelming context of the other visual elements actively negate any angry sensation."
the-memory-of-the-apse-2007.jpg,abstract,68.0,"The emotion of anger is distinctly present due to several visual elements. The most prominent factor is the intense use of vivid, stark red, a color universally associated with strong emotions like passion, danger, and especially anger. This red is not merely a background color but appears in jagged, sharp-edged forms that seem to rupture or forcibly emerge from the darker, more stable mass above. These aggressive, almost violent, shapes convey a sense of conflict and forceful disruption, akin to an outburst of rage or defiance. Furthermore, the visible, raw brushstrokes in the red areas emphasize a feeling of uncontained energy and powerful, perhaps uncontrolled, release, which is characteristic of an angry emotional state. The dynamic tension created by these fiery red elements pushing against or breaking through the imposing dark form suggests a struggle or an intense feeling of frustration breaking free. While not chaotic, the focused intensity and aggressive visual language of the red contribute significantly to an impression of forceful and potent anger."
square-motif-blue-and-gold-the-eclipse-1950.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting, almost to the point of being absent. The artwork is dominated by a highly structured, geometric composition that conveys a sense of order, balance, and deliberate placement rather than chaotic or explosive emotion. The clean lines and neatly arranged blocks, which include squares, rectangles, circles, and a prominent triangle, inherently resist interpretations of uncontrolled rage or fury.

While some colors often associated with strong emotions, such as red (a large square on the lower left) and dark blue (a prominent rectangle in the upper right grid), are present, they are integrated into a larger, diverse palette that includes earthy browns, various shades of white, light blues, and greens. These colors are not clashing in an aggressive or jarring manner; rather, they coexist harmoniously within the grid, preventing any single hue from overwhelming the composition with a singular, intense emotion like anger. There are no harsh, violent, or turbulent brushstrokes; instead, the textures within the blocks appear to be carefully applied, often forming neat linear patterns. The swirling elements in the upper band, while dynamic, are stylized and symmetrical, evoking natural phenomena like wind or water currents rather than a furious emotional outburst. The overall impression is one of calm abstraction, contemplative pattern, or a structured landscape, which stands in direct contrast to the characteristics typically associated with anger. Any flicker of anger would be purely speculative and not supported by the dominant visual language of the piece."
the-last-judgment-1912.jpg,abstract,80.0,"The emotion of anger is powerfully conveyed in Kandinsky's ""The Last Judgment, 1912"" through its aggressive use of color, dynamic lines, and chaotic composition. The predominant black lines are thick, sweeping, and often sharp or jagged, cutting across the canvas with immense force, almost like violent strokes. This creates a strong sense of confrontation and an unyielding, forceful energy. The vibrant and often clashing color palette, particularly the intense reds and oranges juxtaposed against deep blues and greens, generates visual friction and a heightened sense of agitation. This chromatic tension mirrors the internal turmoil and heat associated with anger. Furthermore, the overall composition is one of dense, overlapping, and indistinct forms, contributing to a feeling of turbulence and explosive energy rather than harmony or serenity. There is no sense of calm or repose; instead, the painting pulses with a vigorous, almost untamed dynamism that can be interpreted as intense emotional outburst or divine wrath, particularly given its title. While abstract, the cumulative effect of these elements evokes a potent feeling of intense agitation, conflict, and raw, powerful emotion akin to anger."
the-snail-1953.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The artwork, characterized by its vibrant color palette and abstract, organically cut-out shapes, evokes feelings far removed from anger. The colors used – including various shades of purple, pink, black, greens, orange, red, yellow, and blue – are predominantly bright and lively, creating a sense of joy and dynamism rather than fury or aggression. Unlike colors typically associated with anger (such as deep, brooding reds, oppressive blacks, or harsh, clashing combinations), these hues interact harmoniously, conveying a playful and energetic mood. Furthermore, the shapes themselves, with their soft, irregular edges, lack any sharp points, jagged lines, or confrontational forms that might suggest hostility or tension. The overall composition feels balanced and fluid, with shapes seemingly floating or gently layering over a white background, framed by a warm orange border. There is no visual discord, chaotic energy, or expressive brushwork (as it is a collage) that would communicate agitation or rage. Instead, the piece projects an overwhelming sense of calm, creativity, and visual delight, leaving virtually no room for an emotional interpretation of anger."
the-sculptor-1923.jpg,abstract,3.5,"The painting largely abstains from directly evoking anger. Its abstract, geometric nature and controlled composition tend to promote contemplation of form, color, and symbolic meaning rather than raw emotion. However, a very minimal degree of angularity or symbolic aggression could be perceived in specific elements. The prominent, unyielding red vertical bar, while often representing passion or energy, can also carry connotations of aggression or intensity. More subtly, the sharp, tusk-like or horn-like shape that extends from the central red element possesses a pointed, piercing quality that could, in an abstract sense, be interpreted as confrontational or sharp. The overall starkness and the rigid, somewhat impersonal geometric forms might also, for some viewers, evoke a sense of detachment or even a contained tension, which is a very distant echo of an emotional state that could precede or accompany anger. Despite these minor points, there are no chaotic elements, visible struggle, explicit violence, or agitated brushstrokes that would typically signify anger. The composition feels balanced and deliberate, far from a depiction of rage."
the-open-window-1915.jpg,abstract,72.0,"The artwork evokes a significant sense of anger through its use of sharp, aggressive forms, dynamic composition, and stark contrasts. The prevalent sharp angles, pointed shapes, and jagged edges (particularly visible in the saw-tooth pattern and various acute triangles) intrinsically convey a feeling of aggression, tension, and potential for conflict, directly aligning with the visual language of anger. The multitude of strong diagonal lines creates a powerful sense of forceful, thrusting movement, suggesting a direct and unyielding assertion often associated with angry outbursts or determination.

The fragmented and shattered appearance of the overlapping geometric forms contributes to a feeling of discord, breakdown, or internal turmoil, which are common precursors or expressions of anger. There is no sense of harmony or gentle flow; instead, elements seem to collide or push against each other, creating a pervasive visual tension. The high contrast between the stark black, white, and various shades of grey provides a blunt and unyielding aesthetic, lacking any softness or subtlety that might mitigate the sense of intensity. This starkness amplifies the feeling of severity and directness. Furthermore, the checkered patterns, while geometrically ordered, add a layer of visual ""noise"" and agitation, creating a busy and restless energy that can be interpreted as a manifestation of an agitated or frustrated state. The complete absence of organic forms or curves reinforces the rigid, unyielding nature of the piece, lending it an assertive, almost confrontational, presence."
the-yellow-curtain.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that would evoke or represent anger. The dominant colors, a warm yellow and various shades of blue and teal, are not typically associated with aggressive or volatile emotions; instead, they often convey a sense of calm, light, or vibrancy. While red is present on the far left, it functions as a decorative border with stylized, almost playful figures, rather than an intense or alarming hue. The forms within the composition are largely curvilinear and organic, such as the rounded blue shapes and the flowing red and black elements on the left edge. There are no sharp, jagged, or confrontational lines or shapes that might suggest aggression or tension. The overall composition appears balanced and somewhat serene, lacking any visual chaos, disruption, or violent motion. The brushwork, while visible, does not convey agitated or forceful strokes. There is no discernible subject matter or narrative that could be interpreted as angry, frustrated, or aggressive. The painting's aesthetic leans towards a meditative or harmonious exploration of color and form, standing in direct opposition to the energy and intensity typically associated with anger."
the-western-wall.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The color palette, dominated by vibrant blues in the sky and a mosaic of greens, purples, pinks, and other soft hues in the ""cityscape,"" is far from the harsh, clashing, or aggressive tones often associated with anger. There are no reds used in a way that signifies rage or conflict. The brushwork, while heavily textured and visible, is not violent, slashing, or frenzied; instead, it appears deliberate and contributes to the building-block aesthetic of the forms. The subject matter, an abstract depiction of what appears to be a village or city under a night sky with a crescent moon and stars, carries no narrative elements of injustice, suffering, or conflict that would typically provoke anger. The overall impression is one of vibrancy, energy, or perhaps a dreamlike quality, rather than any form of agitation or displeasure. There is nothing in the composition, forms, or visual language that suggests a feeling of anger from the artist or an intention to evoke it in the viewer."
the-vertebrate-grotto-transfer-series.jpg,abstract,62.1,"The emotion of anger is conveyed in this abstract painting not through explicit figuration, but through an underlying sense of raw, uncontained energy and an almost visceral intensity. The chaotic, bursting forms in vibrant pink and magenta, particularly in the upper half of the composition, suggest an explosive eruption, a forceful outpouring that aligns with the agitated and powerful release characteristic of anger. These shapes appear to be violently pushing upwards, their irregular, organic lines resembling neural pathways or exposed veins, hinting at a heightened"
title-sekere-visual-artist-ayibiowu-olusola-e-david-medium-oil-on-canvas-year-2004-1.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting exhibits very little, if any, elements that evoke anger. The color palette, predominantly bright yellows, oranges, and various shades of blue, is vibrant and energetic rather than harsh or aggressive. There are no deep, brooding reds or clashing, dissonant colors typically associated with rage or hostility. The forms and lines are dynamic and flowing, creating a sense of movement and energy, but they lack the sharp, jagged, or chaotic characteristics that might suggest conflict or turmoil. The figures themselves appear contemplative or engaged with the glowing, spherical objects they hold, and their silhouetted profiles do not convey any facial expressions of anger, frustration, or aggression. There is an absence of violent gestures, tense postures, or themes of confrontation. The overall impression is one of luminous activity, connection, or perhaps spiritual contemplation, which stands in stark contrast to the sensation of anger. Any hint of intensity comes from the visual dynamism, not from emotional agitation or fury."
the-wave-1950.jpg,abstract,7.0,"The artwork features strong, dynamic swirling and wave-like patterns that convey a sense of powerful movement and turbulence. These vigorous, agitated forms might suggest a state of unrest or internal commotion, which could be distantly related to the energy sometimes present in anger. The dark, bold lines defining these patterns add to the intensity of the visual motion.

However, the overall impression does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. The primary color palette of blues, grays, and muted browns tends to be cool and earthy, lacking the fiery reds, oranges, or sharp, clashing contrasts typically associated with rage or aggressive emotion. The lines, while dynamic, are fluid and organic, rather than sharp, jagged, or overtly destructive, which are common visual signifiers of anger in art. There is no depiction of frustration, aggression, or a destructive force that is characteristic of an angry emotional state. Instead, the turbulence appears more akin to natural phenomena, such as powerful ocean currents or wind patterns, which are forces of nature rather than expressions of human emotion. The movement feels like a continuous, inherent dynamic rather than an outburst of emotional fury. Therefore, while there is undeniable energy and a certain agitated quality in the swirling forms, it largely lacks the specific visual vocabulary that would communicate anger as an emotional experience."
the-vertebrated-cavern-series-of-decals.jpg,abstract,35.0,"The depiction of anger in this artwork is subtle and primarily inferred rather than overtly expressed. The most significant element contributing to a sense of anger is the presence of the vibrant pink and red hues concentrated in the upper portion of the composition. Red is universally associated with strong emotions, including passion, aggression, and anger. The fragmented, almost explosive, or bursting quality of these red and pink elements suggests an emotional outburst or a chaotic release of intense feeling, which aligns with the volatile nature of anger. There's a sense of something breaking apart or violently spreading from a central point. However, the specific shade of red veers towards pink, which tends to soften its aggressive impact compared to a more fiery or blood-red. Furthermore, the delicate, intricate patterns within these red forms (resembling veins, coral, or organic growth) introduce a paradoxical sense of fragility or natural beauty that somewhat counteracts pure rage. Below these energetic splashes, the large white and grey form presents a stark, hollowed-out, and almost skeletal appearance. While this form itself doesn't actively convey anger, its desolate and fragmented structure could be interpreted as the aftermath of intense emotional turmoil, where anger may have contributed to a sense of being consumed or left empty. The large dark voids within this structure could be seen as a profound emptiness or pain. Yet, it lacks the tension, aggression, or dynamic movement typically associated with active rage. Therefore, while the colors and abstract forms hint at emotional intensity and potential outbursts that could encompass anger, these elements are not strong enough or explicit enough to convey a dominant sense of fury or aggression, resulting in a moderate, rather than high, score for this emotion."
tumblr-n1ldo3sjum1tur0p6o3-r1-500.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting, an intricate and abstract composition, offers very little to evoke a sense of anger. While there are instances of deep reds and purples within the complex network of forms, these colors are integrated into a broader, earthy palette rather than being used in a confrontational or aggressive manner. There are no harsh or jagged lines that suggest aggression, nor are there any discernible figures whose posture or expression would convey rage or frustration. The overall arrangement of biomorphic and geometric shapes creates a sense of internal complexity and perhaps a subtle disquiet or introspection, but not outright anger. The textures appear somewhat soft and blended, lacking the sharp, agitated quality often associated with angry emotional expression in art. The visual narrative, if one can interpret it, leans more towards a meditative or mysterious state rather than one of conflict or fury. The energy within the painting feels contained and internal, rather than explosive or outwardly aggressive, hence the very low score."
topological-contortion-of-a-female-figure-becoming-a-violoncello.jpg,abstract,5.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present within this artwork. There are no visual elements that directly convey aggression, rage, or fury. The dominant color palette consists of muted grays, whites, and earthy tones, which typically evoke a sense of calm, introspection, or neutrality, rather than volatile emotion. While there are prominent, bold orange-red shapes, their placement and form do not suggest explosive energy, violent impact, or destructive force; instead, they appear contained within the larger biomorphic structures, almost like internal organs or abstracted focal points. The lines and forms are predominantly curved, flowing, and organic, suggesting a sense of entanglement, fluidity, or anatomical complexity, rather than sharp, jagged, or chaotic movements commonly associated with anger. There is no depiction of violent action, conflict, or any figures expressing rage. Any subtle tension that might be perceived from the intertwined or somewhat constrictive forms leans more towards unease, mystery, or internal struggle rather than an outward expression of anger. The overall mood is more surreal and contemplative, lacking the visual cues of force, confrontation, or emotional outburst that would indicate a higher presence of anger."
thursday-jeudi.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting offers very minimal visual cues that could be associated with the emotion of anger. The dominant deep blues and blacks contribute to a contemplative, mysterious, or perhaps melancholic atmosphere rather than one of rage or hostility. The central yellow figure, while stark and somewhat rigid, lacks any discernible facial features or body language typically indicative of anger, such as a furrowed brow, clenched jaw, or aggressive posture. Its ""eyes"" appear as simple horizontal lines, suggesting a closed, stoic, or even blank expression, far from any angry contortion. There are no aggressive forms, sharp lines implying conflict, or vibrant, fiery colors (like red or intense orange) that are commonly used to convey anger. The overall composition is static and lacks dynamic tension or confrontation. While the abstract nature of the work allows for subjective interpretation, there is no direct or even subtly strong visual evidence to suggest the presence of anger in any significant capacity. The mild score acknowledges only the most remote possibility of a viewer associating the stark contrast or isolated figures with an extremely subdued or internal sense of frustration, but this connection is tenuous at best."
tuesday-mardi.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting exhibits extremely minimal visual cues that could be associated with anger. The dominant color scheme features a muted, earthy reddish-brown background and a central figure rendered primarily in white. While red hues can sometimes signify anger, the specific shade here is deep and subdued, lacking the vibrant intensity or aggressive saturation often found in depictions of fury. It feels more grounded and somber than agitated. The white of the central form is generally perceived as neutral, calm, or even pure, further detracting from any sense of rage. The yellow elements are too abstract to carry a specific emotional weight, and certainly not anger.

Furthermore, the forms themselves do not convey aggression or tension. The large, sweeping arcs are gracefully curved and smooth, lacking the sharp, jagged lines or dynamic, explosive movement typically associated with an angry outburst. While they might be interpreted as horns, implying a creature of power, their elegant presentation does not suggest an active state of aggression or wrath. The small orange marks on the white ""face"" are too abstract and minimal to form any discernible angry expression; they are mere daubs of color and do not depict furrowed brows, bared teeth, or a scowl. There is no sense of conflict, frustration, or violent intent in the composition or brushwork. The overall impression is one of stillness and perhaps symbolic contemplation rather than an outpouring of raw emotion. Any interpretation of anger would be highly subjective and strained, relying on very tenuous associations rather than direct visual evidence."
unknown-title-14.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting conveys very little, if any, sense of anger. The color palette, predominantly composed of muted browns, grays, whites, and blacks, lacks the vibrant, aggressive hues (such as strong reds or sharp contrasts) commonly associated with this emotion. The shapes are largely organic, rounded, and interlocking in the upper section, suggesting a more contemplative or harmonious interaction rather than conflict or aggression. There are no sharp, jagged lines, chaotic brushstrokes, or explosive compositions that might evoke feelings of rage or fury. The overall atmosphere is quiet, subdued, and somewhat introspective, with the abstract forms appearing to exist in a state of calm or quiet presence. The textured background and the stylized ""grass"" at the bottom do not suggest agitation or turmoil. While abstract art can sometimes evoke intense emotions, the visual language employed here — in terms of color, form, and composition — is antithetical to the expression of anger. Therefore, the degree to which this artwork evokes anger is extremely low."
unknown-title-5.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, an abstract composition, utilizes a palette dominated by warm yellows and oranges, with significant areas of white and a notable rectangular block of red. While red can sometimes be associated with anger or passion, in this context, it appears as a structured element within a largely harmonious and balanced design. The forms are primarily geometric – semicircles, rectangles, and straight lines – arranged in an orderly fashion. There is a sense of calm and deliberate placement, rather than chaotic energy or agitated movement. The brushwork, where visible, appears smooth and controlled, lacking any aggressive or forceful strokes that might convey frustration or fury. The overall atmosphere of the piece leans towards contemplation, balance, and a gentle visual flow, devoid of any tension, aggression, or discord that would typically manifest as anger. The soft, almost ethereal quality of the background and the deliberate, almost meditative arrangement of the shapes actively works against any interpretation of anger. Therefore, the emotion of anger is virtually absent from this artwork."
totem.png,abstract,58.0,"The painting evokes a discernible sense of anger, particularly in the form of deep frustration or simmering intensity, rather than explosive rage. This is primarily conveyed through the deliberate and prominent use of color and compositional elements.

Firstly, the dominant, large mass of bold, saturated red in the central foreground is a significant indicator. Red is universally associated with strong emotions, including anger, passion, and aggression. Its central placement and substantial size give it a powerful, almost agitated presence that demands attention.

Secondly, the heavy use of dark, imposing forms – the large black shape atop the red, and the deep, rich blues and purples that constitute much of the background and surrounding areas – contributes to a sense of weight, confinement, or brooding intensity. These darker hues can suggest a weighty mood, internal struggle, or an oppressive atmosphere, all of which can breed or accompany anger. The way the central red and black shapes appear somewhat encased or pressed upon by the surrounding colors and the strong vertical white bar reinforces a feeling of constraint or burden, a common source of frustration and anger.

Lastly, the abstract and somewhat blocky, non-harmonious shapes, combined with visible, unrefined brushwork, create a visual tension and discord. There is a lack of fluid grace or calm; instead, the forms feel solid and somewhat starkly contrasted. This visual disharmony can be interpreted as an externalization of inner turmoil or emotional struggle, where anger might reside. While not depicting explicit rage, the combination of these elements creates a palpable undercurrent of intense, perhaps contained, emotional energy that strongly resonates with the feeling of anger or profound irritation."
unknown-title.jpeg,abstract,0.0,"The painting presents no visual cues that would evoke or represent the emotion of anger. The color palette is composed of muted, earthy tones—beige, soft yellow, brown, and dark grey/black—which lack the vibrant intensity or aggressive contrast often associated with wrath. There are no reds, deep oranges, or jarring color combinations that typically signify agitation or hostility. Furthermore, the forms are rendered with soft, feathery, almost ethereal textures, lacking any sharp edges, jagged lines, or forceful, violent brushstrokes that might suggest aggression or tension. The overall composition is highly balanced and symmetrical, bisected by clear horizontal and vertical lines, creating a sense of order, reflection, and stillness rather than chaos, conflict, or agitation. The gentle transitions and contemplative quality of the piece are antithetical to the dynamic, often turbulent nature of anger. There is a complete absence of visual energy or distortion that could be interpreted as a manifestation of rage or frustration."
twins.jpg,abstract,65.0,"The artwork evokes a notable sense of anger through its aggressive and uncompromising formal elements. The composition is dominated by sharp, jagged angles and rigid, block-like forms that interlock and clash, creating a visual language of tension and conflict. The dense cross-hatching used to create shadows adds to the overall intensity and somberness, suggesting a heavy, almost oppressive atmosphere. The central vertical element, in particular, features a series of sharp, downward-pointing spikes that convey a strong sense of disruption or aggression, akin to a visceral outburst or a tearing apart. While the figures at the top are abstract and lack explicit facial expressions of rage, their fragmented, almost distorted construction contributes to an unsettling feeling of internal struggle or harshness. The absence of curves or soft transitions throughout the piece leaves no room for tranquility, instead maintaining a persistent edge that resonates with the raw, unsettling energy of anger. It's an anger expressed through structural harshness and visual agitation rather than overt narrative or human emotion."
unknown-title-16.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no characteristics that would evoke a feeling of anger. The color palette is predominantly muted and earthy, featuring shades of blue, gray, off-white, brown, and a subdued red. None of these colors are presented in a harsh, clashing, or aggressive manner that typically signifies anger or confrontation. The shapes are organic, rounded, and abstract, resembling stylized figures or interlocking elements. They lack any sharp edges, jagged forms, or dynamic movements that might suggest conflict, violence, or agitation. The composition appears balanced and somewhat serene, with the elements seemingly arranged in a contemplative or harmonious manner rather than depicting struggle, tension, or turmoil. There is no narrative implied that involves aggression, frustration, or wrath. While some shapes are red, this particular hue is more earthy than fiery, and its integration into the overall composition does not lend itself to an interpretation of anger. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, balance, or even a gentle, abstract relationship between forms, which stands in stark contrast to any sense of agitation or fury. Therefore, any emotional resonance with anger is virtually non-existent, warranting an extremely low score."
underground-metaphysical-landscape-c-1960-4.jpg,abstract,45.0,"The painting conveys a notable sense of anger through its fragmented composition, discordant color relationships, and agitated textures. The prominent white lines that dissect and outline various abstract shapes create a visual language of breaking apart or shattering, mirroring the disruptive and often destructive nature of anger. These sharp, angular divisions, rather than smooth transitions, evoke a feeling of abruptness and internal confrontation. The color palette contributes to this perception; intense yellows clash with deep, earthy reds and heavy blacks, generating a palpable tension and a sense of unresolved conflict. The reds, though not overtly aggressive in saturation, carry an underlying intensity, suggesting a heated or pressured state, especially when juxtaposed with the darker, somber masses. Furthermore, the visible, coarse, and somewhat aggressive brushstrokes across the canvas create a restless and agitated surface, reflecting the turbulent and uncontained energy often associated with anger. The overall visual disarray and the clashing elements contribute to a feeling of emotional unrest and internal struggle that strongly resonates with the experience of anger or intense frustration."
untitled-1913.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. Its geometric and abstract forms are composed with a sense of order and balance, rather than chaos or aggression. The color palette, while diverse, employs shades that are more earthy, cool, or vibrantly warm (like the orange), but none are used in a manner that conveys fury or hostility. There are no sharp, violent, or clashing lines or shapes that would suggest agitation or aggression. Even the areas of red are contained within defined, structured forms, preventing any overwhelming emotional charge. The overall impression is one of thoughtful construction and intellectual calm, devoid of any visual cues typically associated with anger such as turbulent brushstrokes, chaotic compositions, or explicitly enraged facial features or gestures."
untitled-1947.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric forms in varying shades of green, turquoise, and off-white against a dark base, evokes virtually no sense of anger. Anger in art is often conveyed through vibrant, aggressive colors (such as deep reds, harsh oranges, or stark blacks), chaotic or jagged forms, dynamic and imbalanced compositions, or agitated brushwork. This piece, however, employs a cool and harmonious color palette, dominated by soothing greens and blues, which are typically associated with tranquility, nature, or stability, rather than strong negative emotions. The forms are precisely geometric, structured, and overlapping, creating a sense of depth and order rather than disarray or aggression. There is no visual tension or conflict suggested by the arrangement of shapes or colors. The clean lines and flat planes of color contribute to a serene and contemplative atmosphere, completely devoid of the sharp edges, explosive energy, or chaotic elements that might hint at feelings of rage or frustration. The overall impression is one of calm, balance, and quiet contemplation, rendering the emotion of anger entirely absent from the visual experience."
untitled-1948.jpg,abstract,78.5,"The dominant and pervasive use of a deep, intense red immediately evokes a strong emotional response, often associated with anger, passion, or danger. The color red, in this saturation and expanse, can be overwhelming and contribute to a feeling of agitation or heightened emotional state. Interspersed across this fiery background are numerous sharp, angular, and crisscrossing black lines. These lines do not form coherent or peaceful patterns; instead, they appear almost frantic, like scratches, slashes, or aggressive marks. This chaotic network of lines creates a sense of tension, disruption, and an almost violent energy, reminiscent of a frustrated or enraged outburst. While abstract, the combination of the aggressive red and the seemingly uncontrolled, sharp lines suggests a strong undercurrent of conflict, agitation, or raw emotional intensity that aligns closely with feelings of anger. The overall impression is one of turmoil and a charged atmosphere, rather than serenity or joy, leaning heavily into an interpretation of passionate, almost confrontational energy."
untitled-1966(3).jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. Its palette is dominated by soft, muted tones of white, cream, and delicate light blue, which inherently convey calmness, serenity, and a gentle atmosphere rather than any form of agitation or aggression. There are no harsh, jarring, or clashing colors that might typically be associated with anger or conflict. The forms are abstract but gentle, primarily featuring two subtle, contained circular elements and soft, flowing textures. There are no sharp lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or turbulent compositions that would suggest frustration, hostility, or violence. The faint, almost ethereal scribbled marks across the surface appear more contemplative than agitated. The overall impression is one of quietness, softness, and perhaps introspection, entirely devoid of any visual cues that could lead to an emotional response of anger."
untitled-1.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that typically evoke or convey anger. The composition is highly structured, featuring precise geometric shapes such as triangles, circles, and rectangular prisms. This sense of order and static arrangement contrasts sharply with the chaos, agitation, or distortion often associated with anger. The colors, while bold and distinct, are used in a balanced and harmonious manner; there are no clashing combinations or violent juxtapositions that would create visual tension or discomfort. For instance, the reds are deep and grounded, not fiery or aggressive. The blues, greens, yellows, and oranges contribute to a sense of deliberate construction rather than emotional turmoil. There are no dynamic lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or turbulent forms that might suggest rage or frustration. The overall impression is one of stillness, contemplation, or perhaps a cosmic architectural puzzle, all of which are antithetical to the feeling of anger. While abstract art can be open to individual interpretation, there is a complete absence of visual cues typically understood to represent hostility, conflict, or uncontrolled emotion. The painting feels calm and intellectual rather than emotionally charged with anger."
untitled-1963.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The artwork evokes virtually no sense of anger. The composition consists primarily of clean, precise lines and geometric forms, some overlapping, in a palette of subdued colors including black, light orange, grey, brown, and light green against a beige background. There are no elements typically associated with anger, such as jagged or chaotic lines, aggressive brushstrokes, discordant or vibrant colors (especially reds or oranges used in an intense manner), or imagery that suggests conflict, frustration, or violence. The overall impression is one of calm, intellectual exploration of form and space, possibly meditative or analytical. The orderly nature of the lines and shapes, even in their abstract arrangement, tends to convey a sense of control and thoughtfulness rather than emotional turmoil or aggression."
unstable-compositions-1967.jpg,abstract,68.0,"The painting evokes a distinct sense of anger, though perhaps not an explosive or fiery one, but rather a stark, brooding, or intensely contained rage. This feeling is primarily communicated through the pervasive use of sharp, angular, and geometric forms. Every element in the composition is defined by hard edges and points, creating a visual language of tension, aggression, and potential conflict. These sharp lines can be interpreted as symbolic of cutting remarks, pointed accusations, or the rigid, unyielding nature often associated with anger.

While the color palette lacks the typical warm hues of red or orange often linked to anger, the dominant cool blues, grays, and deep blacks contribute to this emotion in a different way. The deep, almost bruised blues, combined with the heavy black background, create a somber and oppressive atmosphere that suggests a profound sense of dissatisfaction or unresolved turmoil. This isn't the anger of a fleeting outburst, but rather a cold, calculated, or long-simmering resentment. The interlocking and sometimes fragmented nature of the shapes further reinforces a feeling of internal struggle, discord, or the breaking apart of something, all of which are deeply connected to angry states. The overall rigidity and lack of softness or organic flow within the composition leave little room for comfort or resolution, instead trapping the viewer in a visually confrontational and emotionally taut space."
untitled-11.jpg,abstract,82.5,"The painting conveys a significant sense of anger through several compelling visual elements. The dominant background of dark, earthy greens, browns, and deep blues creates a heavy, brooding, and somewhat oppressive atmosphere, which can be a precursor or reflection of suppressed rage or frustration. This weighty darkness feels dense and unyielding.

The thick, impasto application of paint throughout the canvas speaks of forceful, almost aggressive, action. The large, dark rectangular forms, particularly the prominent one in the upper left, feel like oppressive blocks or heavy burdens, contributing to a sense of confinement or struggle that often fuels anger.

The most potent indicators of anger are the vibrant, raw red elements. The stark, isolated red patch in the bottom-left corner is an immediate and visceral symbol of raw emotion, like a fresh wound or an explosive outburst. Its unblended, sharp presence suggests an uncontrolled eruption of feeling. Similarly, the red flecks and smears within the turbulent, thick white stroke at the bottom center are highly suggestive of violence, conflict, or the ""blood"" of a profound emotional struggle.

The turbulent white stroke itself, with its jagged edges and dynamic movement, appears like a violent wave crashing or a forceful struggle unfolding. It represents a powerful, disruptive energy against the dark background. The lone, almost scar-like pink streak in the upper right also breaks the dark monotony, acting as a disruptive element, though less overtly aggressive than the red and white forms.

Overall, the painting communicates anger through its aggressive application of paint, the oppressive dark tones, the forceful and chaotic white forms, and the striking, visceral use of red. It suggests a deep-seated, heavy anger that is either being contained or is erupting in raw, powerful bursts."
untitled-1968-2.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting primarily features deep blues and a luminous yellow, colors not typically associated with anger. While the dark blue areas could evoke feelings of solemnity, depth, or perhaps a slight sense of overwhelming vastness, they do not convey the fiery, aggressive, or agitated qualities often linked to anger. The yellow, bright and expansive, tends to suggest illumination, hope, or energy rather than rage. The visible brushstrokes, though present and textured, are mostly horizontal and do not present as chaotic, violent, or sharp in a way that would imply an angry outburst. The composition itself is very structured and balanced, with distinct horizontal bands, which lends a sense of calm and order rather than conflict or fury. There is no visual tension, clashing elements, or expressive distortion that would strongly communicate anger. Any minimal score for anger would stem from a very abstract interpretation of contrast or weight, but it is not a dominant or clearly conveyed emotion within this artwork."
variation-on-a-theme-1958.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The artwork, a textile piece featuring intricate geometric patterns, evokes virtually no sense of anger. The color palette consists of natural, muted tones, primarily browns, beiges, and hints of yellow/gold, which are inherently calming and earthy rather than aggressive or volatile. There are no harsh, clashing colors or stark contrasts that might visually represent emotional turmoil. Furthermore, the composition is characterized by precise, repetitive, and highly organized patterns of squares, rectangles, and X-shapes. This meticulous order and symmetry convey a sense of calm, control, and craftsmanship, which stands in direct opposition to the chaos, disruption, or uncontrolled energy often associated with anger. The lines are clean and defined, lacking any jaggedness, distortion, or aggressive movement that could be interpreted as an expression of rage or frustration. The overall impression is one of serene craftsmanship and visual harmony, providing no visual cues or emotional resonance that would suggest anger in any form. A score of 0.5 is given to acknowledge the impossibility of definitively assigning a perfect zero in subjective emotional interpretation, but it reflects a near complete absence of any visual elements that could be remotely linked to anger."
untitled-29.jpg,abstract,88.0,"The painting evokes a profound sense of anger, particularly a simmering, internalized, or deeply felt rage, rather than an explosive outburst. The overwhelming presence of a deep, rich red hue is the primary driver of this emotional response; red is universally associated with strong emotions, and in this context, its intensity and saturation lean heavily towards anger, passion, and aggression. This isn't a bright, vibrant red, but a more somber, dense, and almost bruised tone, suggesting a weighty, brooding anger that has settled.

The rough, uneven texture of the paint, visible through its application and what appears to be intentional scoring or impasto, contributes significantly to this feeling. It creates a sense of agitation, rawness, and perhaps even violence or struggle beneath the surface, much like the churning emotions of anger. The irregular lines or 'cracks' further disrupt the field of color, implying tension, fracture, or emotional distress.

The stark, dark gray/black rectangular shape on the left side introduces a heavy, grounding, and somewhat oppressive element. This abrupt contrast against the dominant red can be interpreted as a source of conflict, an obstacle, or a heavy burden that fuels the anger. Its solid, unyielding form stands in stark opposition to the more fluid, intense red, creating a visual tension that resonates with feelings of frustration and resentment. The overall somber and intense atmosphere, devoid of any lighter or softer elements, further emphasizes the gravity and weight often associated with sustained anger."
untitled-2012-6.jpg,abstract,78.5,"The painting evokes a strong sense of anger, primarily through its dominant and intense color palette. The deep, visceral red, almost a rich magenta, is highly saturated and immediately commands attention, a color frequently associated with intense passion, aggression, and rage. The application of the material appears heavy, thick, and highly textured, almost encrusted or coagulated, suggesting a raw and perhaps agitated process. This rough, uneven surface texture conveys a feeling of unrest and a powerful, almost forceful application, as if the emotion itself has been thickly laid onto the canvas with urgency and lack of smooth refinement. The dark, almost charred or corroded edges further intensify this feeling, framing the central mass of red with a sense of brooding weight and potential decay or destruction. There's a tangible quality of dense, perhaps suppressed, or deeply felt emotion that aligns with a raw, visceral anger rather than an explosive, outwardly chaotic one. The underlying glimpses of a circuit board, particularly noticeable in the cropped details, when juxtaposed with the overwhelming, visceral red, can also suggest a forceful disruption or a powerful, even destructive, act that embodies frustration or raw power."
untitled-28.jpg,abstract,7.0,"The visual presence of anger in this painting is extremely low. The dominant colors are deep, somber reds and nearly black hues, which can evoke a sense of weight, intensity, or a brooding emotional depth. While deep red is sometimes associated with passion or even rage, in this context, it is so muted and dark that it conveys more of a profound solemnity or an internalized, perhaps even oppressive, atmosphere rather than overt fury. There are no sharp, aggressive lines, chaotic brushstrokes, violent forms, or clashing contrasts that would typically signify an outward expression of anger. The composition is static, contemplative, and immersive, lacking the dynamism or agitation often linked to anger. Any perceived anger would be deeply internalized, subtle, and largely overshadowed by a sense of quiet intensity or melancholy. The painting prompts introspection rather than a visceral reaction of rage."
untitled-abstraction-mantic-1940.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting is characterized by a strong sense of order and geometric precision, which inherently works against the chaotic and uncontrolled nature often associated with anger. The clean, defined lines and contained shapes, such as rectangles and trapezoids, convey a deliberate and composed structure rather than any impulsive or aggressive energy. While the central red shape is bold and commands attention, its placement within a meticulously layered and framed composition diminishes any potential interpretation of raw aggression or rage. Similarly, the black line, though stark, serves as a divider within an organized system rather than an expression of volatile emotion. The overall impression is one of visual balance and careful design, where strong colors like red and deep blue are used for their formal qualities and visual weight within a structured framework, rather than to depict an emotional outburst. There is no turbulent brushwork, violent gestures, or clashing chaos that would typically evoke a feeling of anger. Any minimal hint of tension might arise from the stark juxtaposition of colors and shapes, but this is resolved into a stable and harmonious composition, far removed from the disruptive force of anger."
untitled-formerly-self-portrait-1945.jpg,abstract,8.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. The dominant colors—black, white, and yellow—do not inherently convey anger. Black often suggests solemnity or emptiness, white purity or starkness, and yellow can imply warmth or energy, none of which directly point to fury. The forms themselves are abstract and flowing, particularly the elongated white figure, lacking any sharp, jagged, or aggressive lines or shapes that might indicate agitation or violence. There is no sense of struggle, conflict, or explosive energy in the composition. While a small, vertical red line is visible within the head-like area of the white figure, and red can be associated with anger, its minuscule size and isolated containment prevent it from permeating the entire canvas with this emotion. It acts more as a singular point of focus or vitality than a pervasive indicator of rage. The blue dots in the upper right further contribute to a sense of distant calm or ethereal space rather than intensifying any latent anger. The overall impression is one of starkness and perhaps introspection or connection, rather than a state of furious emotion."
variation-z-rtlichkeiten-1917.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no characteristics typically associated with the emotion of anger. The color palette, while diverse and including some reds and oranges, does not create a sense of aggression, clash, or tension; rather, the colors blend and interact in a soft, organic, and almost harmonious manner. There are no jarring contrasts or colors that appear to be in conflict. Furthermore, the shapes are rounded, blob-like, and fluid, lacking any sharp edges, jagged lines, or angular forms that might convey aggression, frustration, or hostility. The brushwork, while visible, appears loose and exploratory, not violent, forceful, or frenetic. There's no sense of forceful application or agitated movement in the strokes. The composition feels open and non-confrontational, with elements spread across the canvas without creating any focal point of intensity or struggle. The overall impression is one of calm, gentle exploration of color and form, or perhaps a meditative quality. There is nothing within the visual language of this artwork—its color, form, line, or texture—that evokes even a subtle hint of anger or its associated feelings of irritation, rage, or aggression. The score of 0.5 acknowledges the infinitesimal possibility of subjective, unprovoked projection, but based purely on the objective visual elements, anger is entirely absent."
untitled-2.jpg,abstract,73.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of anger through several distinct visual elements. Firstly, the predominant use of dark, brooding colors – heavy greys, deep purples, and dense blacks – creates an oppressive and turbulent atmosphere, akin to a simmering rage or a gathering storm. This dark palette sets a somber, confrontational tone. Secondly, the texture and brushwork are intensely agitated and vigorous; the impasto technique results in a rough, uneven surface, with visible strokes and chaotic layering, suggesting a forceful, almost violent application of paint. This physical energy embedded in the canvas directly translates to a feeling of raw, uncontained emotion, characteristic of anger.

The stark white forms, particularly the large"
white-line-1936.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The visual elements within this abstract composition offer very little to evoke a sense of anger. The forms are predominantly organic and fluid, lacking any sharp, jagged edges or aggressive thrusts that might suggest confrontation or agitation. The palette consists mainly of muted blues, purples, browns, and greys, which are generally calming or earthy tones, rather than the fiery reds or harsh, clashing contrasts often associated with fury or passion. The intricate patterns and textures within the shapes, while detailed, appear controlled and decorative, not chaotic or violently applied. The white lines that weave through the composition are sinuous and flowing, contributing to a sense of gentle movement or connection rather than tension or discord. There is no discernible disequilibrium or visual harshness in the composition that would trigger an emotional response of anger. The overall impression is one of intricate mystery, quiet contemplation, or biomorphic elegance, all of which stand in stark contrast to the characteristics typically linked to expressions of anger."
weehawken-sequence-1916.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting conveys an extremely low sense of anger. There are no visual elements that directly or strongly evoke this emotion. The color palette primarily consists of cool blues, muted grays, and earthy browns, which tend to create a serene or contemplative mood rather than one of aggression or fury. There are some hints of orange-brown, particularly in the foreground and within the branches, but these are not used with enough intensity or dominance to suggest a fiery or enraged state. The brushstrokes, while visible and somewhat expressive, do not appear violent, frantic, or agitated; they lack the sharp, aggressive energy often associated with anger. The subject matter itself – a landscape with trees (possibly bare, suggesting winter or early spring) and abstract blue forms – does not inherently contain any conflict, struggle, or tension that would lead to feelings of anger. The overall composition is rather quiet and somewhat abstract, lacking any dynamic chaos or confrontational imagery that might trigger an angry response. While the bare branches could be seen as stark, they do not communicate a sense of rage or hostility. The overall impression is one of cool detachment or quiet observation, standing in stark contrast to the volatile nature of anger."
weehawken-sequence-no-30-1916.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The emotion of anger is almost entirely absent from this painting. The color palette, predominantly composed of muted blues, grays, whites, and earthy tones, does not utilize the vibrant, aggressive reds, deep, stormy blacks, or sharp contrasts often associated with anger or conflict. While there are hints of red and yellow in the upper right, they are integrated into a broader, more atmospheric scheme rather than standing out as points of intense emotion. The brushstrokes, though visible and expressive, convey a sense of spontaneous energy and atmospheric rendering, particularly in the sky and foreground, rather than violent agitation or fury. There is no depiction of human figures expressing anger, nor any narrative elements that would suggest conflict, injustice, or rage. The landscape itself, whether a stormy sea or a windswept terrain, evokes natural forces and a sense of atmosphere rather than a direct human emotional response of anger. Any perceived dynamism in the powerful white strokes in the sky suggests natural power or light, not emotional aggression. Therefore, the visual language of the artwork provides virtually no cues that would elicit or represent the feeling of anger."
verticals-157.jpg,abstract,62.0,"The visual composition elicits a palpable sense of anger, albeit one that is more contained and brooding than overtly explosive. This emotion is primarily conveyed through the artwork's dense, rigid vertical elements, which strongly evoke the feeling of a barrier, a cage, or an oppressive confinement. The sheer number and close proximity of these dark, stick-like forms create an overwhelming sense of being hemmed in, a scenario inherently frustrating and a common precursor to anger. Furthermore, the rough, uneven texture of both the vertical elements and the surrounding background contributes to a raw, unyielding, almost brutal aesthetic. This lack of softness or fluidity speaks to a harsh reality, a resistance that could stem from or fuel an angry disposition. The muted, somber color palette—dominated by dark blues, greys, and earthy browns—while not overtly ""angry"" in the way vibrant reds might be, instead suggests a deep, heavy frustration or a suppressed rage that lingers in the shadows. The absence of any clear opening or path to escape within the composition intensifies the feeling of being trapped, amplifying the potential for a simmering, defiant anger against restriction. The artwork does not depict a violent outburst, but rather embodies the weighty, unyielding presence of a profound and perhaps unresolvable frustration, which manifests as a palpable sense of anger."
wall-handball-study-1942.jpg,abstract,35.0,"The artwork presents a dynamic and angular composition that creates a sense of tension and forceful interaction. The sharp, linear forms and the implied motion between the abstract figures suggest a strong, almost impactful energy, particularly indicated by the arcing, striped lines in the center. This kinetic force could be interpreted as an underlying agitation or confrontation, which are facets sometimes associated with the broader spectrum of anger. The disjointed, almost fragmented nature of the figures and elements might also evoke a subtle feeling of discord or unease. However, the muted color palette, the absence of explicit facial expressions or body language indicative of rage, and the overall abstract nature of the scene prevent anger from being a dominant or overtly expressed emotion. The energy conveyed feels more akin to a strenuous effort, a competitive drive, or a contained tension rather than raw, unrestrained fury or animosity. Thus, while there's a degree of forceful interaction and potential friction, it doesn't fully manifest as palpable anger."
why-why-why-triptych.jpg,abstract,55.0,"The artwork evokes a moderate sense of anger through its visual language, primarily expressed not as overt rage but as an underlying current of tension, fragmentation, and disruption. The prominent use of sharp, intersecting diagonal lines and fragmented geometric shapes creates a strong sense of visual conflict and energetic disarray. These angular forms, particularly noticeable in the central panels of each triptych, can be interpreted as visual thrusts or splintered elements, akin to the destructive or forceful energy often associated with anger.

The brushwork, at times appearing bold and agitated, further contributes to this feeling of unresolved tension. While the color palette is generally muted with cool blues and warm browns, hints of darker, almost bruised tones and the occasional reddish hue (especially in the right panel) add a somber or intense quality that can signify suppressed frustration or a simmering intensity. The overall composition lacks harmonious flow, instead presenting a fractured and dynamic interplay of forms that suggests a state of agitated struggle or internal discord, resonating with the tumultuous nature of anger. The fragmented light and shadow within these sharp forms enhance the sense of a breaking point or a forceful impact, implying a degree of aggressive energy."
yellow-and-green-brushstrokes-1966.jpg,abstract,72.5,"The painting evokes a strong sense of energetic force and dynamic aggression, which correlates significantly with the emotion of anger. The primary yellow brushstroke is rendered with bold, sweeping lines and sharp, pointed terminations, suggesting a powerful and almost whipping motion that can be interpreted as an aggressive gesture. This impression is intensified by the dark green elements, particularly the chaotic splatters and drips that appear to violently burst and spray across the canvas. These uncontrolled and impactful visual elements convey a feeling of eruption and intense, uninhibited energy, reminiscent of an outburst. The stark outlines and graphic Pop Art style amplify the directness and visual impact, contributing to a confrontational aesthetic. While the artwork is a stylized representation and not a direct depiction of an angry figure or event, the raw visual power, the depiction of forceful and possibly uncontrolled action, and the sharp, almost explosive quality of the marks strongly align with the characteristics and expression of anger, such as agitation, intensity, and forceful release. The composition is anything but calm or subtle; it communicates a vigorous, almost agitated, expression."
