ang-magbabayo-pounding-rice-1979.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting displays virtually no elements that would evoke a sense of anger. The subjects, a man and a woman, are engaged in what appears to be a traditional, cooperative activity, likely pounding rice with a mortar and pestle. Their body language, while active and indicative of physical labor, shows no signs of aggression, frustration, or hostility. The man's vigorous pose with the pestle suggests effort and strength, not rage, and the woman's posture is one of attentive participation. Neither figure's face is clearly discernible to show any angry expressions like furrowed brows or scowls; their heads are bent, focused on the task. The dominant color palette consists of warm yellows, oranges, and various shades of green, creating a vibrant, luminous, and somewhat serene or industrious atmosphere, rather than the sharp, dark, or chaotic tones often associated with anger. The cubist-inspired fracturing of forms adds dynamism but doesn't convey emotional agitation in an angry sense. There is a strong sense of focused work and perhaps shared domesticity, entirely devoid of conflict or resentment. A score of 5 is given to acknowledge the remote possibility of an observer projecting an extremely subtle, almost imperceptible internal frustration due to the demanding nature of the labor, but there is absolutely no explicit visual evidence to support anger as a prominent or even minor emotion within the artwork itself."
arlequin-dansant-1924.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, characterized by its precise geometric forms, clean lines, and a palette of muted and harmonious colors alongside some brighter, flat tones, offers very little visual information that would typically evoke or represent anger. There are no aggressive or clashing color combinations that might suggest emotional turmoil or agitation. The shapes are well-defined and orderly, lacking the jaggedness, asymmetry, or chaotic brushstrokes often associated with expressions of anger. The fragmented, almost constructivist representation of the figure does not convey any posture, gesture, or facial expression (even in an abstract sense) that implies fury, resentment, or hostility. The overall composition is balanced and controlled, leading to a sense of intellectual deliberation rather than an emotional outburst. While the black eye-like shape on the right side of the face could be interpreted as dark or ominous, it does not specifically translate to anger without further context. The harlequin-like patterns, if anything, lean towards a playful or theatrical mood rather than an aggressive one. Therefore, the emotion of anger is almost entirely absent from this work."
at-wattle-1972-5.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting displays virtually no discernible elements that evoke or represent anger. The woman's facial expression is calm, with neutral features and no indication of scowling, furrowed brows, or a tense mouth. Her body language is relaxed, with her hands resting gently on the fence, conveying a sense of quiet presence rather than any aggressive or agitated posture. There are no visual cues such as clenched fists, rigid stance, or confrontational gaze that might suggest anger. Furthermore, the color palette consists predominantly of earthy tones, muted greens, browns, and whites, lacking the harsh reds or violent contrasts often associated with this emotion. While the brushwork is textured and somewhat expressionistic, it does not convey a sense of chaotic or furious energy. The overall atmosphere of the scene, depicting a woman with a cow in what appears to be a rustic or agricultural setting, is one of quietude and introspection, rather than conflict, frustration, or rage. There are no symbolic elements or narrative hints within the composition that would lead a viewer to interpret anger as a primary or even secondary emotion. The interaction between the figures appears peaceful and unremarkable in terms of emotional intensity, making any attribution of anger extremely tenuous."
abstract-composition-figures-in-a-landscape-1930.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The visual elements within this abstract drawing offer very little to suggest the emotion of anger. There are no harsh, sharp, or violent lines, nor are there any aggressive forms or figures that would typically convey such an intense emotion. The color palette, consisting primarily of greens, blues, yellows, and grays/blacks, does not feature the reds or deep, turbulent tones often associated with rage. While the dense black hatching in certain areas (such as the large section in the upper left and a smaller section in the lower right) might be interpreted as creating a sense of density or a slight agitation due to the energetic strokes, this reading is tenuous and far from a direct expression of anger. It appears more as a textural or shading technique rather than an emotional outpouring. The overall composition feels more like an intellectual exploration of fragmented forms and spatial relationships than an emotional landscape. Therefore, the presence of anger is minimal to almost non-existent."
animal-destinies-the-trees-show-their-rings-the-animals-their-veins.jpg,Cubism,92.5,"The painting, ""Fate of the Animals"" by Franz Marc, conveys an overwhelming sense of anger through its ferocious visual language and the tragic subject matter. The entire composition is a maelstrom of sharp, splintered forms and violent diagonal lines that tear across the canvas, creating an intensely aggressive and destructive atmosphere. This fragmentation and visual tearing are highly evocative of an explosive, uncontrollable rage.

The dominant color palette significantly contributes to this feeling of anger. Fiery reds explode across the scene, reminiscent of flames, blood, or raw, unbridled fury. These reds clash with deep, tumultuous blues and dark greens, amplifying the sense of chaos and intense emotional upheaval. The energetic, almost frenzied brushwork further reinforces this feeling of violent action and a destructive force being unleashed.

While the animals themselves appear to be victims—fleeing, suffering, or caught in the cataclysm—the destructive force that engulfs them is portrayed with an almost furious intensity. The painting doesn't depict the animals *being* angry, but rather being subjected to an angry, destructive power, whether from nature, fate, or human conflict. This overwhelming sense of violent impact and the brutal chaos it inflicts resonates deeply with the raw energy of anger. The painting essentially screams with a visceral, destructive energy that mirrors the experience of intense rage."
a-red-pedestal-1942.jpg,Cubism,38.0,"The painting exhibits a moderate, yet not overwhelming, degree of latent tension and visual energy that can be subtly associated with anger. The most prominent factor contributing to this score is the dominant, vibrant red background. While red can symbolize passion, energy, or warmth, it is also strongly linked to aggression, rage, and elevated emotions. Its pervasive presence creates an atmosphere of heightened intensity rather than calm.

Furthermore, the fragmented, angular forms characteristic of Cubism lend a sense of disruption and deconstruction. The objects, including what appears to be a musical instrument and a skull-like shape, are broken down into sharp, geometric planes and reassembled, which can be perceived as an aggressive intellectual dismantling of reality, or a visual representation of discord. The strong black outlines and shapes against the red also create stark contrasts and a somewhat jarring visual rhythm that feels less harmonious and more confrontational.

However, the score is not higher because the subject matter itself (a still life) is not inherently violent or overtly emotional in a direct way. There are no figures expressing anger, no explicit scenes of conflict, and the fragmentation, while potentially unsettling, is primarily a stylistic choice of the Cubist movement rather than an explicit emotional outburst. The overall impression leans more towards intellectual tension or dynamic energy rather than outright fury or wrath. It suggests an underlying agitation or intensity, but not the explosive force typically associated with strong anger."
bouteille-et-livre-rose-1926.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The color palette consists of soft, muted tones such as pale peach, light green, lavender, white, and various shades of brown and light blue. These colors are inherently calming and harmonious, completely devoid of the intensity, harshness, or clashing contrasts often associated with the emotion of anger. The forms themselves are abstract, a combination of geometric and organic shapes, but they lack any sharp edges, jagged lines, or dynamic movements that might suggest aggression, turmoil, or conflict. The composition appears balanced and somewhat contemplative, rather than chaotic or agitated. There are no discernible figures or scenes that could be interpreted as displaying anger, nor is there any visual tension or psychological unease conveyed through the arrangement of elements. The overall impression is one of stillness, perhaps a puzzle or an exploration of form and color, but certainly not one that would elicit or reflect feelings of rage, frustration, or hostility."
baj-chez-picasso-4-1969.jpg,Cubism,10.0,"The visual elements in this artwork do not strongly convey the emotion of anger. There are no traditional angry facial expressions such as furrowed brows, bared teeth, or a scowling mouth. The predominant blue color, especially with its bubbly texture, tends to evoke feelings of calmness or introspection rather than aggression or rage. The red base, while a color often associated with anger, is rendered in a stable, repetitive, and orderly pattern, which diminishes any sense of fiery or chaotic emotion.

However, a very subtle hint of a lack of serenity, which *could* be a distant precursor or component of anger, is present due to certain formal qualities. The sharp, angular lines forming the figure's head, particularly the pointed 'beak' or nose and the sharp crest, introduce a sense of rigidity or sternness. The large, singular yellow eye is intense and direct, conveying a focused or perhaps unyielding gaze rather than a soft or gentle one. This directness, combined with the geometric, somewhat unapproachable form, creates a subtle undercurrent of tension or assertiveness, preventing the image from feeling entirely peaceful. It suggests a presence that is firm and unyielding, which, at a very abstract level, could be a highly subdued and contained manifestation of energy that might, in other contexts, lead to anger. Nonetheless, without any overt signs of hostility or aggression, the score remains very low."
biblical-scene.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that convey anger. The figures are depicted in a quiet, almost tender interaction, with one person appearing to attend to another who is lying down, possibly adjusting a blanket. There is no aggressive body language, such as clenched fists, raised arms, or confrontational stances. The facial features, though stylized, do not show any signs of agitation, frustration, or rage; there are no furrowed brows, open mouths shouting, or strained expressions. The color palette, dominated by deep purples, teals, oranges, and yellows, is not inherently angry; these colors evoke a sense of calm, warmth, or night, rather than the sharp, intense hues often associated with anger. Furthermore, the overall composition and atmosphere are peaceful and contemplative, devoid of any chaotic lines, violent imagery, or tense energy that might suggest underlying anger or conflict. The visual narrative is one of quiet intimacy or care, completely absent of any indicators of hostility or resentment."
breads-1920.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this still life painting that evokes or communicates anger. The subject matter consists of commonplace, inanimate objects—a scale, loaves of bread, and a teacup—arranged on a table, which are inherently neutral and carry no angry connotations. The colors used are predominantly earthy browns, blues, and grays, which contribute to a somber or contemplative mood rather than an aggressive or agitated one. There are no sharp, clashing, or violently intense hues that might be associated with anger. The composition is stable and grounded, lacking any chaotic arrangement, turbulent forms, or dynamic lines that could suggest internal turmoil or external aggression. The brushwork, while visible and textured, is not frantic, agitated, or violent in a way that would convey an emotional outburst. There are no human figures whose expressions or actions could convey anger, nor any symbolic elements that point towards this emotion. The overall impression is one of quiet observation and perhaps a sense of the mundane or humble, far removed from any feeling of anger."
bibemus-quarry-1898-1.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting, a landscape by Paul Cézanne, conveys an overwhelming sense of solidity, structure, and contemplative stillness, rather than any emotion associated with anger.

1.  **Color Palette:** The dominant colors are earthy greens, oranges, and browns, with muted yellows and blues in the sky. While red/orange can sometimes be linked to anger, here they appear as sun-baked terracotta, natural rock formations, and autumnal foliage, giving a sense of warmth and groundedness rather than fiery rage or aggression. There are no jarring, clashing, or intensely vibrant colors that would typically signify an agitated or angry mood.
2.  **Brushwork and Form:** Cézanne's characteristic brushwork, though visible and deliberate, creates volumetric, stable forms. The lines are strong and define the masses of the rocks, trees, and buildings, but they are not sharp, jagged, or chaotic in a way that suggests violence or fury. The composition feels dense and weighty, lending a sense of permanence and stillness, entirely devoid of the turbulence or destructive energy often associated with anger.
3.  **Composition and Subject Matter:** The scene depicts a quiet, natural landscape with some architectural elements that appear integrated into the terrain. There are no figures expressing emotion, no signs of conflict, destruction, or upheaval. The overall arrangement of forms is balanced and harmonious, leading the eye through a peaceful, if rugged, environment. There is no narrative element that would suggest strife or resentment.
4.  **Overall Mood:** The painting evokes feelings of quiet observation, the timelessness of nature, and the solidity of forms under light. Its intensity stems from the artist's focused analysis of perception and structure, not from any overt emotional expression of anger. The atmosphere is one of profound calm and stability.

Therefore, any sense of anger in this artwork is virtually absent, earning it a score very close to zero."
bull-plate-x-1946.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"This minimalist line drawing, likely of a bull, evokes very little to no anger. The lines are fluid and graceful, not sharp, jagged, or aggressive, which are typical visual cues for tension or rage. The pose of the animal is static and composed, lacking any dynamic movement that might suggest a charge or attack. There are no features, such as narrowed eyes, bared teeth, or tensed muscles, that would convey an emotional state of anger. The overall impression is one of calm simplification and an exploration of form, rather than an expression of raw emotion. While a bull can be a symbol of power or aggression, its depiction here is highly abstracted and serene, effectively neutralizing any inherent anger one might associate with the animal. The black and white medium also lacks the fiery hues often used to represent intense emotions like anger. A very low score is assigned because there are absolutely no visual elements in the artwork itself that suggest or portray anger, yet one might argue that the subject matter (a bull, albeit abstracted) could subliminally carry a very faint echo of power that *could* be associated with anger by some, but this is a stretch and not directly supported by the visual execution."
chorinho-1942.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, ""The Jazz Band"" by William H. Johnson, depicts a group of musicians and a listener engrossed in a musical performance. There are no visual elements within the artwork that convey anger. The figures, while stylized and abstracted, do not exhibit any facial expressions indicative of rage, frustration, or hostility. Their eyes are either closed, cast upwards, or focused on their instruments, suggesting concentration, soulful engagement, or spiritual reflection rather than any form of animosity. The body language of the musicians is focused on playing their instruments, and the figure on the far right, with clasped hands over a blue shape, appears to be in a state of emotional absorption, possibly sorrow or deep contemplation, but not anger. The overall color palette of cool blues, grays, and whites contributes to a somber, contemplative, or soulful atmosphere, which contrasts sharply with colors typically associated with anger such as vibrant reds or aggressive contrasts. The composition is harmonious, featuring interconnected figures engaged in a shared experience, devoid of any tension, conflict, or aggression that would signal anger. There are no destructive actions, aggressive gestures, or chaotic elements that would elicit or represent anger."
chateau-noir-1.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, a landscape by Paul Cézanne, conveys a sense of stillness, observation, and the structural integrity of nature and built forms. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that suggest or evoke the emotion of anger. The color palette, consisting primarily of greens, blues, and warm ochres for the buildings, is harmonious and grounded, devoid of any harsh, aggressive, or fiery tones typically associated with anger (such as vivid reds or clashing contrasts). The brushwork, while visibly textured and broken into planes, is systematic and constructive, aimed at building form and volume rather than expressing violent emotion or agitation. There are no sharp, jagged lines, chaotic movements, or dynamic conflicts within the composition that would imply fury or rage. The scene itself, featuring a house nestled within a landscape of trees and a cloudy sky, is inherently peaceful and contemplative, presenting a stable and enduring world. Therefore, the feeling of anger is completely absent from this work. A score of 0.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of subjective interpretation, but objectively, the visual language offers no basis for this emotion."
bull-study-1946.jpg,Cubism,8.0,"The depiction of a bull as the subject matter might initially suggest a connection to strength, power, and potential aggression, which could be associated with anger. However, this series of drawings is fundamentally an intellectual exploration of form and reduction, rather than an emotional outpouring. The precise, controlled, and methodical progression from a more naturalistic bull to an increasingly simplified and abstracted geometric form strongly mitigates any sense of anger. The lines are clean and deliberate, showing a calm and analytical artistic process, rather than the frenetic, jagged, or explosive energy often associated with anger. Even in the highly abstracted final forms, while they possess a certain solidity and monumental quality due to the dark shading and heavy shapes, they do not convey an agitated or hostile emotional state. The essence captured is one of structural integrity and abstract representation, not emotional fury or aggression. The systematic stripping away of detail further removes any potential for specific expressive anger found in more naturalistic portrayals."
composition-cubiste-au-portrait-poisson-et-clair-de-lune-1926.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting displays absolutely no discernible elements that would evoke or represent anger. The subject matter, a still life featuring a fish and what appears to be a jug or vessel rendered in an abstract, somewhat Cubist style, is inherently calm and devoid of emotional intensity. The color palette primarily consists of cool blues, muted greens, browns, stark black and white. None of these colors are used in a way that suggests aggression, passion, or rage; rather, they contribute to a sense of geometric order and quiet contemplation. The lines are clean and defined, lacking any harshness, jaggedness, or chaotic energy that might be associated with an angry state. The composition is balanced and static, without any dynamic tension or implied movement that could suggest conflict. There is no depiction of struggle, violence, or any agitated form. The overall impression is one of stillness, structure, and a deliberate, intellectual approach to form and color, entirely devoid of any emotional turmoil or anger."
bust-of-woman-1939.jpg,Cubism,15.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. While the fragmented and distorted nature of the Cubist portrait might evoke a sense of unease or internal turmoil in the viewer, these qualities do not directly translate to an overt display of anger from the subject.

Key aspects contributing to this low score include:
1.  **Facial Expression:** There are no traditional visual cues of anger, such as a furrowed brow, narrowed eyes, or a scowling mouth. The eyes, though prominently rendered, appear intense or watchful rather than hostile or enraged. The mouth is highly abstract, making it impossible to interpret a specific emotion like a grimace or snarl.
2.  **Color Palette:** The background's dominant blue with vertical yellow-green stripes creates a relatively calm and stable backdrop, not one typically associated with volatility or rage. While red and orange tones are present in the figure's face and clothing, they are used to define form and add vibrancy, rather than to convey a pervasive feeling of aggression or fury. Their integration within the broader palette does not create an angry atmosphere.
3.  **Lines and Forms:** The sharp, angular lines and geometric fragmentation are characteristic of Cubism and serve to deconstruct and reassemble reality. While these elements can create a sense of tension or psychological complexity, they do not inherently express anger. The overall composition is static, lacking dynamic movement or aggressive gestures that might suggest an outburst of emotion.
4.  **Overall Mood:** The painting conveys a sense of introspection, perhaps melancholy, or a deconstruction of perception, rather than an active state of anger. Any underlying tension seems more existential or related to the artistic exploration of form rather than a direct emotional expression of rage."
city-movement-1940.jpg,Cubism,42.5,"The painting conveys a subtle undercurrent of tension and disquiet that can be associated with anger, rather than an overt expression of rage. The fragmented and dynamic composition, characterized by sharp angles, disjointed forms, and overlapping planes, creates a sense of visual agitation and chaos. This lack of harmonious integration can evoke a feeling of frustration or unease. The heavy, imposing blue forms dominating the center, which could represent machinery or structures in an urban landscape, suggest an overwhelming or perhaps even oppressive force. This industrial subject matter, depicted with starkness and a sense of constant, sometimes jarring, movement, contributes to an atmosphere of relentless activity that could lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed or irritated. While there are no explicit depictions of angry figures or violent actions, the overall harshness of the lines, the energetic but unsettling dynamism, and the somewhat claustrophobic feeling of the dense urban environment suggest a low-grade frustration or an implicit critique of the subject, which are facets of anger. The color palette, dominated by cool grays and deep blues, with stark accents of red, further emphasizes this sense of a harsh, perhaps unfeeling, environment where effort and tension are palpable."
composition-iv-1916.jpg,Cubism,75.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of agitation, tension, and conflict, which are closely associated with anger. The composition is dominated by sharp, jagged, and fragmented geometric shapes that appear to collide and intersect rather than flow harmoniously. This visual ""breaking apart"" and ""clashing"" of forms creates a feeling of disruption and unease. The dynamic interplay of strong, contrasting colors—intense reds and yellows against deep blacks, blues, and greens—further amplifies this tension, suggesting a fiery or confrontational energy. There is no clear focal point, and the eye is constantly pulled across the canvas by the aggressive angles and disparate elements, contributing to a feeling of being overwhelmed or unsettled. The textured, almost frenetic strokes in some lighter areas also add to the sense of a restless, agitated force at play. While not overtly depicting a specific angry scene or figure, the abstract language of the painting effectively communicates a powerful state of visual discord and explosive energy, resonating with the emotional experience of anger."
aviator.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, a prime example of Cubo-Futurism, is characterized by its geometric fragmentation, sharp angles, and dynamic composition, which inherently create a sense of energy and movement rather than explicit emotional states. There is very little in the artwork that directly or strongly suggests the emotion of anger. The figure of the fisherman is highly stylized, lacking any discernible facial expression or body language that would convey rage, frustration, or aggression. His posture is static and somewhat stoic, not confrontational or agitated.

While the sharp, angular forms and fragmented planes could be interpreted by some as creating a sense of tension or jarringness, this is more a characteristic of the Cubo-Futurist style's aesthetic principles – depicting motion and urban dynamism – than an intentional conveyance of emotional anger. There is no narrative conflict depicted that would evoke anger, nor are the colors used in a way that overwhelmingly signifies this emotion (e.g., overwhelming, aggressive reds). The peculiar elements, such as the small fork or utensil sticking out of the hat, or the number ""0"" on it, are more whimsical, surreal, or symbolic in nature rather than indicative of irritation or fury. The large, stylized fish is a simple part of the subject matter, not a symbol of struggle or aggression. Overall, the painting prioritizes formal experimentation and the depiction of modern life and movement over deep psychological emotional expression, resulting in a very low presence of anger."
composition-with-the-mona-lisa-1914.jpg,Cubism,78.0,"The painting evokes a significant degree of anger, primarily through its provocative and iconoclastic elements. The most striking embodiment of this anger is the prominent red ""X"" scrawled across the face of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, a universally recognized symbol of classical art. This act is a deliberate defacement and a visual declaration of rejection and defiance against established artistic traditions and the perceived stagnation of the past. It speaks to a revolutionary anger, a desire to dismantle old forms to make way for the new. The artist is not simply observing but actively participating in a forceful dismissal of artistic dogma.

Furthermore, the overall fragmented and dynamic composition, characteristic of Cubo-Futurism, contributes to this feeling of agitated energy. The sharp angles, overlapping planes, and the juxtaposition of disparate elements create a sense of disruption and deliberate artistic turbulence. This visual energy can be interpreted as a manifestation of the artist's forceful assertion of a new artistic vision, driven by a deep-seated frustration or indignation with the artistic status quo. The bold, contrasting colors and the dominant black rectangle also add to the painting's assertive and almost confrontational presence, reinforcing the sense of an aggressive break from convention. The painting expresses a clear, directed, and defiant anger towards the traditional art world."
composition-ii-still-life-1916.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting, with its abstract composition of geometric forms and muted colors, evokes virtually no sense of anger. The color palette, consisting primarily of various shades of green, warm oranges, earthy browns, and deep, somewhat subdued reds, leans towards a contemplative or harmonious aesthetic rather than one of aggression or conflict. There are no harsh, clashing colors or intense, fiery reds that might typically signify rage. The forms themselves, while geometric, are not presented in a chaotic or violently fragmented manner. The straight lines and defined shapes, including circles, triangles, and rectangles, contribute to a sense of order and structure rather than disarray or emotional outburst.

While some of the darker, more solid forms on the right side of the canvas might be perceived as imposing or weighty, they convey sternness or mechanical presence more than hostility or aggression. There are no sharp, jagged lines or explosive brushstrokes that would indicate a violent or agitated emotion. The visible brushwork appears controlled and deliberate, rather than frantic or expressive of inner turmoil. The overall composition maintains a sense of balance and rhythm, which is counter to the visual chaos often associated with anger. There is no discernible subject matter (such as distressed figures or conflict scenes) that would directly trigger feelings of anger. Any extremely faint, almost imperceptible connection to anger might be a highly subjective and indirect response to the rigidness or impersonal nature of the machine-like abstract elements for a very small subset of viewers, potentially evoking a minuscule sense of constraint or detachment that could be distantly linked to frustration. However, this is a very tenuous interpretation, and the painting largely lacks any visual cues commonly associated with the emotion of anger."
construction-africa-cezanne-cubism-and-japan.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The artwork exhibits no discernible elements that would evoke or express anger. The color palette, though varied, is predominantly bright and balanced, lacking the harsh, clashing, or aggressively dominant hues often associated with rage or frustration. There are no violent, sharp, or distorted forms that might suggest conflict or turmoil. Instead, the geometric shapes and orderly arrangement, even within the eclectic assemblage, convey a sense of intellectual exploration and synthesis rather than emotional outburst. The cultural references and art historical labels (""CÉZANNE,"" ""AFRICA,"" ""CUBISM,"" ""& JAPAN"") suggest an academic or celebratory tone, highlighting influences and connections rather than expressing discontent or protest. There are no figures depicted in a state of anger, nor are there any narrative elements or symbolic objects that typically convey aggression or hostility. The overall impression is one of thoughtful curation, artistic dialogue, and perhaps whimsical curiosity, entirely devoid of any visual cues or thematic undertones that might be interpreted as anger."
crimea-alupka-1916-1.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that would evoke anger. The color palette, while vibrant with strong blues, greens, yellows, and white, does not include hues typically associated with rage or turmoil. There are no harsh, jarring reds, aggressive blacks, or murky, oppressive tones that might suggest fury. The blues of the sea and sky convey a sense of depth and expansiveness, rather than hostility or agitation. The greens of the cypress trees and the earthy tones of the landscape are natural and calming. The brushwork, though visible and somewhat expressive, is not aggressive, chaotic, or violent; it appears more deliberate, forming distinct shapes and capturing light, contributing to a stable rather than volatile scene. The subject matter itself—a serene coastal landscape with quaint houses and tall trees—is inherently peaceful and picturesque, devoid of any human figures expressing anger, conflict, or any destructive elements. There are no turbulent skies, crashing waves, or scenes of discord. The composition, while dynamic with its winding path and staggered buildings, maintains a sense of balance and harmony, without any visual tension or instability that might imply underlying anger. The overall mood conveyed is one of tranquility, bright observation, and a serene appreciation for the natural and built environment, standing in direct opposition to any feeling of anger."
dances-at-the-spring-1912.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The painting, with its fragmented, geometric forms and a limited palette of browns, oranges, and off-whites, offers very little to evoke a sense of anger. Anger is typically conveyed through sharp, aggressive lines, violent contrasts, or expressions of fury or struggle. While the angularity of the figures, characteristic of Cubism, could theoretically suggest a certain tension, it does not translate into an emotional state of rage or hostility. There are no confrontational poses, no destructive actions, and no agitated brushstrokes that would indicate intense emotional turmoil. The colors, predominantly warm and earthy, are not those typically associated with anger, which might include aggressive reds or jarring, clashing tones. Instead, the unified, almost monochromatic palette tends to create a sense of visual coherence rather than discord. The overall impression is more analytical and focused on the deconstruction of form and movement, rather than the depiction of any specific intense emotion, least of all anger. Any minimal hint of tension from the sharp angles is far from expressing genuine fury or aggression."
costume-design-3.jpg,Cubism,7.5,"The visual representation of anger in this artwork is extremely minimal. There are no strong indicators of rage, fury, or frustration in the figure's facial expression or body language. The eyes are heavily lidded, perhaps suggesting weariness or a fixed, distant gaze, but not anger. The mouth is a thin, straight line, devoid of any snarl, grimace, or baring of teeth. The skin tone is pale, not flushed with emotion.

While the overall style is highly stylized with sharp, geometric angles, which can sometimes convey intensity or rigidity, these elements are primarily design choices that create dynamism and a sense of movement rather than reflecting an internal emotional state of anger. The figure is striding forward with purpose, holding a cane or sword, but the posture is more formal and decisive than overtly aggressive or confrontational. There are no clenched fists or tense, ready-to-strike stances. The bold red shapes on the limbs and torso are decorative elements of the costume rather than expressive of inner turmoil or aggressive energy. Therefore, any sense of anger is almost entirely absent, with the sharp lines providing only a very abstract and indirect hint of intensity that might, by the greatest stretch, be associated with a strong emotion, but not specifically anger."
constructive-town-1925.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting largely conveys a sense of stillness, contemplation, and a somewhat detached, almost surreal atmosphere, which offers very little visual evidence to evoke the emotion of anger. There are no overt indicators typically associated with anger such as agitated brushstrokes, aggressive postures, confrontational gazes, or a dynamic narrative of conflict or frustration.

The dominant color palette consists of muted and cool tones—various shades of grey, green, blue, and brown—which contribute to a calm or even melancholic mood rather than one of rage or aggression. While touches of red are present in the curtain and some elements of the still life, they serve as accents within the overall subdued scheme and are not used in a way that suggests intensity, danger, or fury.

The figures within the painting further reinforce the absence of anger. The woman, partly obscured in the doorway, has a stylized, almost expressionless face and a static, sculptural pose. She appears more as an object of formal study than a subject conveying intense emotion. Similarly, the white dog in the foreground sits calmly, observing the scene with no signs of agitation, fear, or aggression.

The geometric and architectural composition, with its sharp angles and structured forms, creates an ordered and somewhat rigid environment. While this might be interpreted by some as sterile or impersonal, potentially leading to a *subtle, indirect* feeling of unease or emotional distance, it does not translate directly into a sensation of anger or frustration. The scene lacks any chaotic elements or dynamic tension that would suggest an outburst or underlying rage. The overall impression is one of quiet observation and formal composition, distinctly lacking the visual cues that would provoke an emotional response of anger. The score of 5 reflects the near-complete absence of visual indicators for anger, allowing only for the most abstract and tenuous, almost projected, interpretation of very subtle underlying tension that is far from explicit anger."
crane-and-pitcher-1945.jpg,Cubism,8.0,"The painting exhibits a very low degree of anger. While the stark subject matter of a skull typically evokes themes of mortality or solemnity rather than explicit rage, certain elements contribute to a subtle, almost intellectual harshness that could be distantly related to a sense of aggression or discomfort. The vibrant red-orange background, particularly with its dark grid overlay, possesses an intensity that can feel unsettling, and red is often associated with strong emotions, including anger. The fragmented, angular forms characteristic of Cubism, combined with bold black outlines, create a sense of abruptness and deconstruction, which could be interpreted as an aggressive artistic statement against traditional forms. Additionally, the stylized, jagged ""teeth"" of the skull, while primarily symbolic of decay, could be perceived as having a slight snarl-like quality. However, there is no dynamic action, overt aggression, or clear emotional expression of fury from the subjects themselves. The overall mood is more one of disquieting stillness and intellectual analysis rather than an outpouring of wrath. Any perceived anger is therefore extremely subdued, indirect, and derived more from the painting's stark visual tension and formal qualities than from an overt emotional display."
deer-in-the-forest-1913.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no discernible elements within Franz Marc's ""Deer in the Forest II"" that evoke the emotion of anger. The painting primarily features deer in a serene, almost contemplative state, nestled within a vibrantly colored forest. The animals themselves exhibit no aggressive postures, expressions of distress, or signs of conflict that would suggest anger from them or towards them. While the palette includes strong, non-naturalistic colors, particularly the prominent reds and yellows in the background, these hues are used to convey a sense of spiritual energy, vitality, or a dreamlike atmosphere rather than aggression or fury. The swirling lines and abstract forms contribute to a dynamic composition but do not create a sense of agitation, violence, or any form of antagonism. The overall impression is one of harmony, peace, and a mystical connection with nature, completely devoid of any visual cues or implied narratives that would elicit or represent anger."
dessert-1913.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this Cubist still life. There are no subjects or figures depicted that exhibit anger, nor are there any narrative elements suggesting conflict or hostility. The color palette, predominantly composed of muted browns, greens, and grays with hints of yellow, lacks the fiery reds, harsh oranges, or stormy dark tones often associated with anger. While the fragmented forms and sharp, intersecting geometric lines characteristic of Cubism could be interpreted by some as creating a sense of visual tension or disruption, this aesthetic choice is more aligned with an intellectual deconstruction of reality and multiple perspectives rather than an expression of raw emotional agitation or hostility. The precision and analytical nature of the Cubist style, even in its fragmentation, do not convey uncontrolled rage or fury. The still life genre itself tends to be contemplative and ordered, and despite the stylistic innovation, the underlying mood is not one of emotional turmoil. Any feeling of ""sharpness"" or ""dynamic energy"" inherent in the composition's angles is far removed from the feeling of genuine anger."
ecstasy-1960-2.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting conveys a profound sense of introspection, dreaminess, and melancholic contemplation rather than any trace of anger. The predominant cool blue and muted pink hues contribute to a serene, almost ethereal atmosphere, completely lacking the fiery intensity or sharp contrasts typically associated with anger. The figures, depicted with soft, flowing lines and translucent overlays, exhibit no aggressive postures, tense muscles, or violent gestures. The central figure's expression appears thoughtful and somber, devoid of any furrowed brows, bared teeth, or other visual cues that would signify wrath or frustration. Similarly, the other visible faces do not convey any sense of hostility. The subject matter itself, seemingly involving music, contemplation, and perhaps spiritual themes, is inherently antithetical to the emotion of anger. There is no visual tension, conflict, or harshness in the brushwork or composition that would evoke a feeling of rage or indignation. The overall impression is one of fluid harmony and quiet reflection, rendering any sensation of anger virtually absent."
composition-au-visage-et-au-coquillage-1939.jpg,Cubism,82.0,"The painting conveys a significant degree of anger, primarily through the intensely portrayed figure on the right. The most striking element is the figure's mouth, depicted with bared teeth in a raw, almost snarling grimace, a universally recognized signifier of aggression, distress, or anger. Complementing this, the eyes of the figures, particularly the one on the right, are rendered as wide, concentric circles, suggesting an intense, perhaps agitated or furious gaze.

The overall composition contributes to this feeling of agitation. The forms are fragmented, angular, and somewhat chaotic, creating a sense of disjointedness and tension. The strong use of warm colors—deep oranges, reds, and browns—can evoke a sense of heat, passion, and intense emotion, leaning towards the fiery nature of anger. These are contrasted with dark blacks and stark white or grey lines, which add to the sense of conflict and dramatic intensity. The brushwork appears robust and less refined, further contributing to a raw, uncontained emotional expression. While abstract, the deliberate portrayal of a confrontational or distressed facial expression within a tense, fragmented environment strongly communicates a feeling akin to anger."
dropsgezicht-1911.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting exhibits a vibrant and somewhat raw aesthetic through its bold use of color and angular, almost fragmented forms. While strong colors, particularly reds, and sharp lines *can* sometimes be associated with intensity or tension, in this particular artwork, they do not predominantly evoke the emotion of anger. The red roofs, though prominent, are presented as part of a lively, if stylized, village scene, and do not convey rage or aggression. The angular depiction of trees and buildings appears to be a stylistic choice, creating visual dynamism and structure rather than embodying destructive force or frustrated energy. There are no figures whose expressions or actions suggest anger, nor is there any narrative element or symbolism within the composition that points towards feelings of indignation, fury, or hostility. The overall atmosphere, despite its visual energy, feels more expressive and decorative than emotionally turbulent or aggressive. Therefore, any sense of anger is extremely minimal, arising only from a very broad interpretation of 'intensity' that is far removed from true emotional wrath."
diavolii-stage-design.jpg,Cubism,72.5,"The emotion of anger is significantly present in this stylized composition, conveyed primarily through the figures' forms, gestures, and color choices, despite the abstract nature of the artwork.

Firstly, the **angular and sharp geometric forms** used to construct the figures themselves contribute to a feeling of rigidity, harshness, and potential confrontation. Unlike organic or flowing shapes, these sharp lines suggest tension and a lack of softness, which can be indicative of underlying or overt anger.

Secondly, the **prominent use of red** on the central figure's large cloak and on elements of the right figure's body is a strong visual cue for anger. Red is universally associated with passion, aggression, and fury. Its bold presence against the darker background immediately draws attention and intensifies the emotional temperature of the scene.

Thirdly, the **central figure's imposing and rigid posture**, combined with its stylized, sharp-featured ""face"" (particularly the small, intense red ""eyes""), evokes a sense of stern authority or profound displeasure. This isn't a relaxed or benevolent figure; rather, it exudes a controlled power that could easily stem from or express anger.

Fourthly, the **right figure's dynamic, forward-leaning stance and accusatory or forceful pointing gesture** strongly suggest agitation, demand, or aggression. This active posture, along with the zigzag lines seemingly emanating from its arm (which can symbolize erratic energy or intense emotion), points towards a moment of confrontation or assertion, which are frequently driven by anger.

Finally, the **overall dramatic tension** created by the composition, with strong diagonal lines cutting through the background and the figures arranged in a theatrical or confrontational manner, generates a palpable sense of conflict. This high-stakes atmosphere is fertile ground for the expression of anger, even if it is not explicitly depicted through conventional facial expressions. While the anger isn't an uncontrolled explosion, it manifests as sternness, confrontation, and a potent, directed energy."
egg-beater-no-4-1928.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no visual cues typically associated with anger. The color palette, while vibrant, is balanced and harmonious, lacking the harsh, clashing, or aggressive tones that might evoke feelings of rage or hostility. The lines are clean, precise, and controlled, contributing to a sense of order and structure rather than chaos, frantic energy, or destructive force. Similarly, the geometric and abstract shapes, despite their dynamism and fragmentation, do not convey any sense of sharp aggression, violence, or emotional distress. There are no elements of discord, oppressive weight, or jarring visual conflict that would lead to a perception of anger. The overall impression is one of energetic design and intellectual playfulness, quite removed from any sentiment of wrath or frustration."
enclosures-and-broken-branches-1938.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting registers an extremely low degree of anger. There are very few visual cues that evoke this emotion. The color palette is composed primarily of muted earth tones—browns, greens, and subdued blues—which lack the vibrant, clashing, or fiery hues typically associated with anger, such as reds or oranges. The overall mood conveyed by these colors is one of quietude, observation, or perhaps a somber reflection on natural processes, rather than intense displeasure or fury.

Furthermore, the subject matter, which appears to be a cross-section of a landscape or an abstracted view of geological layers and natural elements like roots or branches, does not inherently possess angry connotations. While the gnarled, bare branches might suggest harshness or decay, they convey a sense of enduring the elements or the passage of time rather than active rage or aggression. Their forms are somewhat static and resigned, not dynamic or violent.

The brushwork and composition are largely controlled and textural, utilizing repetitive patterns and distinct layers. There is an absence of chaotic, aggressive, or unrestrained brushstrokes that would typically communicate emotional turmoil or explosive energy. The linear and patterned elements, though abstract, do not suggest conflict or emotional outburst. There are no figures expressing anger, no violent actions depicted, nor any visual tension created through sharp contrasts or dissonant forms that would trigger a sense of anger in the viewer. The painting maintains a cool, analytical distance, making it largely devoid of any discernible emotional heat associated with anger."
falk-sleeping-gypsy.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no visual cues within this painting that suggest anger. The central figure's expression, though somewhat abstracted, shows no tension in the brow, no pursed lips, nor any other facial characteristics typically associated with this emotion. Her eyes appear closed or downcast, conveying a sense of quietude or introspection rather than agitation or hostility. The body language is relaxed and languid, with flowing lines in the drapery and a general lack of rigidity or clenched forms that might indicate frustration or aggression. The color palette, featuring blues, greens, purples, and muted browns, contributes to a calm and almost melancholic or peaceful atmosphere, completely devoid of the sharp, fiery, or confrontational tones that might accompany anger. The overall mood of the painting is one of domestic tranquility, contemplation, or rest, making any interpretation of anger entirely incongruous with the visual evidence presented."
factory-in-nara-1918.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The painting displays a landscape with a prominent bridge and buildings, rendered with somewhat expressive, visible brushstrokes and a palette featuring greens, earthy browns, reds/pinks, and a grey, clouded sky. There is very little in this image that directly evokes anger. The subject matter itself – a bridge and buildings in a landscape – is neutral and does not depict conflict, injustice, or any overt source of aggression. The color choices, while including warm reds in the buildings, are not used in a way that feels aggressive or fiery; they appear more as structural elements or brickwork. The dark, cloudy sky might contribute to a slightly somber or moody atmosphere, but this is a far cry from anger. There are no angry figures, no violent actions, and no chaotic or jarring compositional elements that would typically be associated with intense rage. The overall feeling conveyed is more one of observation, perhaps moodiness due to the weather, or an exploration of architectural forms within nature, rather than any strong sense of indignation or fury. The minimal score acknowledges the potential for the slightly darker, heavier sky to evoke a sense of unease that could, in a very abstract and indirect way, relate to a broader spectrum of negative emotions, but it certainly doesn't register as anger."
farm-at-montgeroult-1898.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, characteristic of Paul Cézanne's style, exhibits a profound sense of structural analysis and contemplative observation rather than any emotional agitation, particularly anger. The palette consists of earthy ochres, greens, blues, and muted browns, which are inherently calm and grounded, entirely lacking the fiery reds, sharp contrasts, or dark, oppressive hues often associated with anger or aggression. The brushstrokes, while visible and deliberate, are used to build form and volume through planes of color, creating a sense of solidity and order rather than chaotic or violent energy. There is no frenzied or agitated movement in the brushwork that could suggest a loss of control or an outburst of wrath. The subject matter itself—a quiet street scene with buildings and trees—is devoid of any human figures or events that might depict conflict, frustration, or any other manifestation of anger. The overall composition is balanced and thoughtful, reflecting a meticulous study of form and space, which is antithetical to the impulsive and disruptive nature of anger. There is no sense of tension, confrontation, or distress conveyed through any artistic element; instead, a prevailing atmosphere of stillness and quiet reflection dominates, leaving virtually no room for the interpretation of anger within the artwork. The score is not an absolute zero as art interpretation can be subjective, and a microscopic point of tension might be argued by some in the subtle tilts or perceived weight of forms, but this is negligible in the context of the emotion of anger."
explosion-lyrique-no-c-1918.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting, characterized by its vibrant colors and dynamic brushstrokes, primarily evokes feelings of energy, movement, and perhaps exhilaration rather than anger. There is a complete absence of elements typically associated with anger in visual art. The figure's posture, with outstretched arms, suggests embrace, dance, or expansive motion, not aggression, tension, or frustration. While the color palette is bold and intense, featuring strong reds, blues, and greens, these colors are used to create a sense of vibrant flow and dynamism, not discord or hostile emotion. The visible brushwork, while energetic, does not convey a sense of violent application or rage. There are no harsh, jagged lines that might suggest aggression or internal turmoil, nor any destructive or confrontational imagery. The overall impression is one of expressive vitality and liberation through color and form, making the presence of anger negligible to non-existent. Any minute interpretation of anger would be solely due to the sheer intensity of the colors and movement, which could, in an extremely abstract and forced way, be misconstrued as an 'outburst,' but fundamentally lacks any of the destructive, frustrated, or aggressive qualities inherent to anger."
etude-pour-sculpture-1944.jpg,Cubism,20.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this abstract composition, appearing more as a subtle, underlying tension rather than an overt expression. The painting largely avoids the visual cues typically associated with anger: there are no aggressive gestures (the prominent hand is open, not clenched), no explosive or sharp lines, and no dominant use of hot, fiery colors. While a small segment of red is visible within the central blue form, it is not employed in a manner that conveys rage or aggression.

The fragmented and somewhat contorted forms, particularly the central blue shape, could be interpreted as a depiction of internal distress, frustration, or a sense of being fractured. If this blue form is seen as a head or face, its obscured or ""gagged"" appearance by the horizontal bar might suggest suppressed emotion, which could potentially include latent anger. However, this is a highly interpretive reading and not a direct visual statement of rage. The overall cool and earthy color palette (blues, browns, whites) and the relatively smooth brushwork contribute to a more subdued and contemplative mood, diminishing any strong sense of active anger. Any perceived anger is therefore extremely subtle, indirect, and more indicative of an implied psychological state of tension or suppression rather than an outward display of fury."
enangalismos.jpg,Cubism,38.0,"The emotion of anger in this painting is present but not overwhelmingly dominant, manifesting more as an underlying tension and a component of emotional turmoil rather than outright rage or aggression.

Several visual elements contribute to this feeling:

1.  **Color Palette (Red Accents):** The most direct indicator is the strategic use of vibrant, almost raw red in abstract, angular shapes, particularly on the right side and subtly elsewhere. Red is universally associated with strong emotions, including anger, passion, and alarm. Its sharp contrast against the predominantly dark, muted blues, greens, and purples creates an immediate sense of urgency and emotional heat. These red elements act like sharp bursts or wounds within the composition, hinting at irritation, pain, or a sudden surge of feeling.

2.  **Fragmented and Abstract Forms:** The fragmented nature of the forms, which appear to be disembodied hands and a partially obscured face, contributes to a sense of internal conflict and disorientation. This fragmentation can symbolize a mind or spirit in distress, where anger might be brewing or struggling to be expressed. The elongation and somewhat strained posture of the right hand, appearing to reach or clench, suggests tension and perhaps frustration or a desire to grasp or push away, actions often associated with anger. The heavy, dark form on the lower left further adds to a feeling of emotional weight or burden.

3.  **Expressive Brushwork and Compositional Tension:** The visible, dynamic brushstrokes and the overall abstract, non-representational style create a sense of movement and raw emotion. There is no serenity or calm in the composition; instead, there's a certain agitation and lack of clear resolution. This expressive quality implies a charged emotional state, and anger is a powerful, volatile emotion that aligns with such energetic, yet unsettling, brushwork. The stark contrast between light and dark areas also builds visual tension, mirroring internal strife.

However, the anger is not depicted in an overt, aggressive manner. There are no screaming faces, violent gestures, or overt destruction. Instead, it feels more like a simmering, internal frustration or a response to deep distress, rather than an explosive fury. The darkness of much of the painting could even suggest that the anger is submerged or contained, adding to the sense of a complex emotional landscape where anger is one contributing factor to a"
fallen-figure-1939.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting exhibits very few, if any, characteristics commonly associated with the emotion of anger. The color palette primarily consists of muted greys, soft blues, light greens, and earthy tones, with a deep maroon in the top right. There are no vibrant, aggressive reds, oranges, or stark contrasts that typically convey rage or intense agitation. The dark maroon is deep but lacks the fiery intensity often linked to anger; instead, it feels more somber or contemplative.

The forms are geometric and precise, composed of clean lines and smooth, rounded cylinders and blocks. While there are sharp angles, they are integrated into a structured and balanced composition, lacking the chaotic, jagged, or explosive fragmentation often seen in art expressing anger. There is a sense of order and controlled arrangement rather than frenetic energy or violent disarray. The surfaces appear smooth, without any visible, aggressive brushstrokes that might suggest agitation or forceful movement.

The overall composition feels stable and intellectual, almost architectural, rather than confrontational or emotionally charged. The visual language of this artwork leans towards contemplation, order, and perhaps a cool detachment, which are antithetical to the explosive, chaotic, and often destructive nature of anger. Any sensation of tension is minimal and results more from the abstract interplay of forms and planes rather than from an overt emotional expression."
femme-1954.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The presence of anger in this painting is extremely minimal, almost negligible. The primary reason for any score above zero would be the prominent use of a bold, deep red color in two distinct areas of the composition. Red is often associated with intense emotions, including anger, passion, or aggression. However, in this particular context, the red does not manifest as an angry, violent, or agitated force. It appears as solid, defined shapes, almost like blocks of color, rather than chaotic, explosive, or fiery elements that might typically convey rage.

Beyond the color, there are no other visual cues that suggest anger. The brushstrokes, while bold, are not jagged, frenzied, or violent; instead, they appear controlled and deliberate, forming strong outlines and defined masses. The abstract or highly stylized forms within the painting do not possess any discernible facial expressions or body language that would indicate aggression, tension, or frustration. There are no sharp, colliding lines, nor is there a sense of chaotic movement that often accompanies expressions of anger in art. The overall composition feels more grounded and perhaps contemplative or sensual, rather than agitated or hostile. Therefore, while the color red offers a faint, distant association with anger, the painting's overall aesthetic and formal qualities do not support or amplify this emotion."
farm-woman-1908.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no direct visual cues that would convey the emotion of anger. The figure's face is rendered in a highly simplified, mask-like manner, with eyes that are closed or heavily lidded, preventing any expression of furious gaze. There is no furrowing of the brow, no baring of teeth, nor any tensing of the jawline commonly associated with rage. The mouth is depicted as a straight, narrow line, utterly devoid of any downturned corners indicative of a frown or an open shape suggesting shouting or snarls. The overall facial expression is one of profound stoicism or inward contemplation, rather than outward aggression or resentment. Furthermore, the body posture is frontal and stable, without any gestures or tension in the shoulders or arms that would suggest agitation or readiness for confrontation. The color palette, while containing dark browns and oranges for the figure's form, also features a prominent, serene blue for the clothing, which does not inherently evoke anger. Any perceived sense of anger would be extremely indirect, perhaps stemming from a highly subjective interpretation of the figure's unyielding, monumental presence or a deep, suppressed emotional state, but there is no explicit visual evidence to support an interpretation of active or even simmering anger. The dominant mood is one of quietude or solemnity, making a high score for anger entirely inappropriate."
figure-in-un-interno-1947.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is no discernable emotion of anger present in this artwork. The composition, color palette, and implied interactions between the figures do not evoke any sense of aggression, conflict, or frustration. The lines, while gestural and dynamic, are not sharp or violent. The colors are muted pastels and earth tones, lacking any harsh reds or clashing combinations that might suggest agitation or fury. The figures themselves, rendered in an abstract manner, do not exhibit angry postures, facial expressions (which are largely undefined), or confrontational body language. Instead, the overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, interaction, or perhaps melancholy, rather than any form of active anger. The atmosphere conveyed is calm and introspective, making any association with anger entirely absent."
farm-woman-1908-1.jpg,Cubism,3.0,"The painting depicts a highly stylized, blocky figure, almost mask-like in its abstraction, which limits the ability to discern specific emotions. There are no clear facial expressions of anger, such as a scowl, furrowed brows, or a grimace. The figure's posture is rigid and frontal, conveying a sense of stoicism, weight, or monumentality rather than aggression, agitation, or defiant rage. The hands are block-like, not clenched in fists. The color palette consists of muted browns, blues, grays, and greens, which are somber and earthy, lacking the vibrant reds or stark, clashing contrasts typically used to visually represent intense anger or fury. While the overall heavy and somewhat static presence of the figure might suggest internal tension or a burdened state, these qualities are ambiguous and do not distinctly point to anger over other possibilities like sorrow, weariness, or resolute endurance. Any perception of anger would rely on a highly indirect and abstract interpretation of the figure's profound stillness or implied internal struggle, rather than explicit visual cues."
ferry-at-bigwin-island-1952.jpg,Cubism,45.0,"The emotion of anger in this painting is primarily conveyed through the striking use of color, particularly the prominent red. The large, abstract red shape in the upper left background feels like a burst of volatile energy or a looming, aggressive force, dramatically contrasting with the cooler blues and grays. Red is intrinsically linked to strong emotions such as passion, danger, and rage, and its application here contributes a sense of underlying tension or potential conflict. The red trim along the boat further accents this, adding a sharp, almost defiant edge to the vessel.

Additionally, the depiction of the turbulent, choppy waves, rendered with strong, angular brushstrokes, suggests a struggle against the elements. While not directly ""angry"" themselves, these powerful natural forces can evoke feelings of confrontation and the raw, unyielding power of nature, which can be interpreted as a form of environmental ""anger"" or hostility. The dark, somewhat abstract background elements also contribute to a mood of intensity and potential turmoil.

However, the score is not higher because the painting does not depict overt aggression or destructive chaos. The boat, despite being amidst waves, appears resilient and somewhat stable in its cubist form. There are no figures expressing rage, nor is there a sense of imminent destruction. The anger conveyed is more an abstract, primal force within the environment or a strong emotional current suggested by the color and dynamic composition, rather than an explicit portrayal of rage or violence. It's a simmering intensity, a latent power, rather than an explosive fury."
figure-blanche.jpg,Cubism,85.5,"The artwork evokes a strong sense of anger through several compelling visual elements. Primarily, the heavy, almost brutal, application of black ink and the stark contrast against the white background immediately create an atmosphere of intensity and unrest. The dominant central figure, a grotesque, animalistic, or monstrous form, is rendered with thick, forceful lines that suggest raw power and aggression. Its ""eyes"" are hollow and wide, staring out with an unsettling intensity that can be interpreted as a furious gaze, while the pointed, beak-like or fang-like protrusion from its lower part conveys a menacing and potentially biting quality, a clear indicator of hostility.

Further contributing to the sensation of anger are the sharp, linear elements that resemble teeth or spikes, particularly on the left side of the central form and the vertical structure on the right. This latter element, resembling a dislocated spine or exposed bone, with its sharp protrusions, feels like a tortured or aggressive entity, potentially emanating or being consumed by rage. The jagged and uneven textures throughout the piece, particularly in the heavily inked areas, suggest a turbulent and agitated state, mirroring the internal turmoil associated with anger. There is a primal, unrefined quality to the mark-making, which gives the impression of raw emotion being violently expressed, rather than controlled or nuanced feelings. The overall composition feels heavy and oppressive, reflecting the weighty and consuming nature of intense anger. The energy conveyed is not one of subtle irritation but of a potent, almost destructive, force."
forms-1918.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This abstract composition displays no discernible elements that evoke or suggest the emotion of anger. The painting is characterized by clean, precise geometric forms and smooth, deliberate lines. There is an overarching sense of order, balance, and stability, rather than chaos, aggression, or agitation. The color palette, while featuring contrasts between cool blues, purples, and grays with accents of red/pink and teal, is harmonious and does not utilize harsh, clashing, or violently intense hues that might trigger a sense of rage or frustration. The shapes themselves—cylinders, cubes, spheres, and various wedges and curved elements—are solid and well-defined, devoid of any jagged edges or sharp, pointed forms commonly associated with aggression or conflict. Furthermore, the overall composition is thoughtfully arranged and static, lacking any dynamic tension, explosion, or disarray that could visually translate into an angry outburst. The painting exudes a controlled, deliberate aesthetic, which stands in complete opposition to any feeling of anger."
figure-with-balls-1938.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no discernible elements that directly convey the emotion of anger. The central figure, composed of dark, heavy, and abstract forms, maintains a largely static and contained posture, lacking any aggressive stance, dynamic movement, or violent tension typically associated with rage. There are no explicit facial features to express fury, nor are there any agitated or explosive lines or brushstrokes that would suggest an outburst of emotion. The color palette is muted, dominated by subdued dark blues, browns, and grays, entirely devoid of the fiery reds or harsh contrasts that often symbolize anger. While the overall mood might be perceived as somber or introspective due to the enclosed and weighty forms, it does not communicate an outward or inner state of anger. Any interpretation of anger would be highly subjective and without strong visual support from the artwork itself. The very low score reflects the profound absence of visual cues for this specific emotion."
futorismo-1927.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric shapes, lines, and arcs, offers very little to evoke the emotion of anger. The color palette predominantly consists of earthy tones like browns, greys, and blacks, along with whites and some muted yellows. None of these colors are typically associated with intense anger or aggression; there are no harsh reds or jarring contrasts that might visually signify fury.

The lines and forms, while dynamic with their sweeping arcs and intersecting planes, do not convey agitation, violence, or sharp discord. Instead, there's a sense of order and rhythmic flow, as if depicting mechanical movement or musical harmony. The shapes interlock and overlap in a structured manner rather than clashing chaotically. There are no figures, expressions, or narrative elements that could suggest a state of anger or conflict. The overall impression is one of intellectual arrangement and design, rather than raw emotional expression. Any perceived 'tension' is structural or compositional, not emotional. Therefore, the visual language of the painting does not align with the common representations or feelings associated with anger, resulting in a very low score. The slight non-zero score acknowledges the subjective nature of art interpretation and the potential for a viewer to project minor unease onto the darker segments or the interplay of forms, but this is minimal in the context of anger."
fruit-bowl-pipe-and-newspaper.jpg,Cubism,5.2,"The painting, a quintessential example of Analytical Cubism, presents a fragmented and geometric deconstruction of everyday objects. While the fractured perspective and overlapping planes can initially create a sense of intellectual disorientation or challenge, there are very few, if any, visual elements within this specific artwork that directly evoke or express anger. The color palette, dominated by greens, browns, and whites with touches of black and blue, is generally subdued and lacks the vibrant, aggressive reds or harsh, clashing contrasts often associated with feelings of rage or fury. The forms, though broken, are meticulously rendered with precise lines and controlled brushwork, indicating an analytical and intellectual approach rather than an impulsive or agitated expression of emotion. There are no human figures whose expressions or postures might convey anger, nor is there any narrative context suggesting conflict, violence, or resentment. The subject matter—a still life featuring a newspaper (""LE JOL""), a goblet, and possibly a pipe—is mundane and domestic, devoid of inherent tension or aggression. Any faint, indirect hint of disquiet that might arise from the fragmented reality is far too subtle and cerebral to register as a strong emotional response like anger; it falls more into the realm of intellectual curiosity or mild visual intrigue rather than emotional turmoil. The overall impression is one of contemplative abstraction rather than passionate ire."
figure-with-fruit-dish.jpg,Cubism,68.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of sternness, tension, and a powerful, unyielding emotional state that resonates with anger. This is primarily achieved through several key visual elements. Firstly, the prominent use of a deep, rich red on the figure's left shoulder and arm immediately introduces a color commonly associated with intense emotions, including rage and passion. This red is a focal point, drawing the eye to an area that feels charged. Secondly, the Cubist fragmentation of the figure, especially the face, employs sharp angles, rigid lines, and geometric forms. This inherent angularity creates a visual harshness and tension, contributing to a feeling of discomfort and severity rather than tranquility. The shadowed, abstracted face, in particular, lacks any soft features; its stark planes and deep-set shadows give it a severe, almost grim or unapproachable expression, suggesting an internal state far from placid. The overall dark and earthy palette further contributes to a heavy, somber atmosphere, emphasizing the seriousness and intensity of the implied emotion. While there is no explicit depiction of an angry action, the combined effect of the aggressive color, sharp forms, and the monumental, rigid presence of the figure evokes a strong sense of contained intensity, a brooding power, or a suppressed force that aligns significantly with the feeling of anger. It feels less like sorrow or fear and more like a potent, perhaps even simmering, internal conflict or defiance."
gelmeroda-1936.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting evokes very little, if any, sense of anger. The dominant cool palette of blues, grays, and muted greens tends to create a feeling of calm, introspection, or perhaps melancholy, rather than agitation or rage. There are no harsh, clashing colors or aggressive brushstrokes that typically signify anger. While the composition is fragmented and geometric, reflecting a Cubist influence, this fragmentation feels more like an analytical deconstruction of the subject (a church or townscape) rather than an expression of emotional turmoil or destructive energy. The lines are clean and precise, contributing to a sense of order despite the multiple perspectives. There are no discernible figures or narratives that would suggest conflict or fury. The overall atmosphere is cool and detached, almost serene, which stands in stark contrast to the volatile nature of anger. The subtle warmth in some of the browns is too subdued to ignite any passionate emotion. Therefore, the presence of anger is minimal, almost negligible."
girl-untying-her-sandal-1973.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The artwork, with its geometric abstraction and limited color palette of white, dark brown, and beige, communicates a profound sense of stillness and introspection rather than anger. The figure, depicted with clean, precise lines, appears contemplative and subdued, her head seemingly bowed or turned away, and her posture quiet and contained. There are no visual cues commonly associated with anger: no aggressive or chaotic lines, no harsh or clashing color combinations (like fiery reds or jarring contrasts), and no dynamic movement or tension that would suggest agitation or aggression. The overall composition is balanced and serene, creating an atmosphere of quiet reflection. Any potential for anger is entirely absent from the visual language, which leans heavily towards a meditative or melancholic mood. The minimal score reflects the near-complete absence of any elements that could reasonably be interpreted as conveying anger."
golgotha-1912.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting does not primarily evoke a strong sense of anger. While the central figure's depiction, reminiscent of a crucifixion or a figure in a state of vulnerable exposure, might implicitly suggest themes of injustice or suffering which *could* provoke anger in a viewer or the depicted characters, there are no overt visual cues of this emotion. The facial expressions of the figures are largely stylized or serene/mournful, not angry or enraged. The blue figure, despite its vulnerable pose, appears more contemplative or resigned than angry. The surrounding figures show signs of lament or solemn observation, particularly the figures on the left. The man on the right carrying the ladder has a determined or possibly burdened look, but not one of rage. The color palette, dominated by greens, blues, and yellows, with some reds, is vibrant and mystical rather than aggressive or fiery in a way that would signify anger. The geometric fragmentation and dream-like quality create an atmosphere of spiritual contemplation and sorrow rather than overt wrath or fury. Any perception of anger would likely stem from an external interpretation of the event's historical context (injustice leading to suffering) rather than from the direct emotional portrayal within the artwork itself."
girl-portrait-1930.jpg,Cubism,8.0,"The painting conveys a very minimal, almost imperceptible sense of anger. There are no overt signs of rage, fury, or strong emotional outburst displayed by the subject. Her facial expression, while intense and somewhat severe, lacks the typical indicators of anger such as furrowed brows, a clenched jaw, or an agitated mouth. Her gaze is direct and piercing, which can sometimes be associated with sternness or displeasure, but it does not escalate to an angry glare. The red accents on her cheeks are ambiguous; they could be a stylistic choice, blush, or perhaps a faint flush of emotion, but not definitively indicative of anger.

Her body language is composed; she is seated upright, and her hands are calmly resting, holding a book. There is no tension in her posture, nor any suggestion of aggression or readiness to confront. The overall color palette is subdued, without the vibrant, fiery reds or sharp contrasts often used to depict intense anger. The angularity of the modernist style might suggest a certain tension or psychological complexity, but this is a far cry from an explicit portrayal of anger. Any hint of anger in this painting is extremely internalized, suppressed, and manifests more as a profound seriousness or a deep, quiet intensity rather than a visible or active display of displeasure. Therefore, while a minute undercurrent of sternness or perhaps subtle dissatisfaction might be very faintly perceived by some, it does not coalesce into a clear depiction of anger."
green-squash-1948.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that strongly evoke anger. The color palette, while featuring warm oranges and some dark browns and blacks, does not utilize them in a way that conveys aggression, rage, or violent emotion. The oranges feel more like a background or an earthy tone rather than a passionate, fiery red associated with anger. The yellows are bright and almost cheerful, and the greys and purples are muted or contemplative.

The brushwork is expressive and visible, but it does not appear frenzied, agitated, or violent; rather, it suggests texture and form. There are no sharp, jagged lines or chaotic compositions that might imply intense emotional turmoil or conflict. The abstract forms, which seem to depict a still life with flowers and possibly fruit, are distorted but not in a manner that suggests pain, frustration, or destructive energy. There are no human figures or situations of direct conflict that would naturally elicit anger.

While art is subjective, and a viewer might project a negative feeling onto the heavier, darker shapes, there is nothing inherent in the visual language—colors, lines, forms, or subject matter—that directly communicates anger as a dominant or even perceptible emotion. The overall impression leans more towards contemplation, abstraction, or a study of light and form, rather than an intense emotional state like anger. The very low score reflects the near absence of any visual cues typically associated with this emotion."
homage-to-mozart.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The primary subject, a bust of Mozart, is rendered with a serene and contemplative expression, showing no signs of agitation or distress. Musical instruments such as violins and a piano, prominently featured, are universally associated with harmony, beauty, and emotional expression through sound, rather than discord or fury. While the color red is extensively used, which can sometimes be associated with strong emotions like anger, in this context, it appears to signify vibrancy, passion, or the energetic quality of music rather than rage or hostility. The geometric and fragmented elements characteristic of its style create a dynamic composition, but this dynamism leans towards artistic energy and structural rhythm, not aggression or conflict. There are no visual cues such as harsh, clashing forms, violent actions, destructive imagery, or distorted figures that would typically elicit a feeling of anger. The overall impression is one of artistic reverence, musical contemplation, and creative vitality, all of which stand in stark contrast to any emotion of anger."
haven-opus-2-1926.jpg,Cubism,3.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. The artwork primarily utilizes smooth, geometric forms, and a muted, largely monochromatic color palette, which are elements not traditionally associated with conveying rage or aggression. The lines are clean and controlled, creating a sense of monumentality and deliberate construction rather than chaos or violent energy. There are no jagged, disruptive lines, clashing colors, or distorted figures that would typically evoke anger.

While the sky is dark and cloudy, potentially hinting at a dramatic or foreboding atmosphere, it does not translate into an overt expression of anger. The clouds are stylized and the overall composition remains balanced and orderly, lacking the turbulence or explosive quality often linked with this emotion. The small touches of red/orange, a color sometimes associated with anger, are too sparse and integrated into the architectural-like forms to carry significant emotional weight or disrupt the painting's otherwise tranquil, contemplative, or perhaps solemn mood. The overall impression is one of a constructed, industrial landscape or a symbolic, abstract space, devoid of any visual narrative or emotional intensity that would suggest anger."
head-1918.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting predominantly features clean, sharp geometric shapes and precisely delineated forms. This visual language of strict order and intellectual control strongly counteracts the chaotic and explosive nature typically associated with the emotion of anger. While the composition is fragmented, this fragmentation appears to be a deliberate, analytical deconstruction of form rather than an expression of internal turmoil or violent rupture. The lines, though angular, are exact and contained, lacking any jaggedness, erratic movement, or aggressive thrust that might convey rage or agitation.

The color palette, while vibrant and contrasting with bold pinks, blues, reds, and oranges, is applied within clearly defined boundaries. The red elements, often associated with anger, are presented as solid, structured blocks rather than as fiery or explosive splashes, thereby neutralizing any potential aggressive connotation. There is no visible aggressive brushwork or dynamic, outward energy that would typically convey an angry outburst. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the potential figure offers no discernible facial expressions or body postures that could be interpreted as angry or confrontational. The overall impression is one of calculated design and formal exploration, leaving very little room for the raw, disruptive emotion of anger to manifest visually."
house-manhufe-1913.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The color palette is composed primarily of earthy tones – greens, browns, ochres, and muted reds for the buildings – which are inherently calming and natural, lacking any harsh or aggressive contrasts often associated with this emotion. There are no vibrant, clashing reds, deep turbulent blues, or jarring yellows that might signify agitation or fury.

Furthermore, the lines and shapes, while stylized and somewhat geometric due to the painting's early modern aesthetic, are not sharp, jagged, or violent. The paths, in particular, flow smoothly through the landscape, guiding the eye rather than creating a sense of obstruction or friction. Even the angular forms of the buildings and the elongated, almost flame-like trees on the left convey a sense of structured observation rather than chaotic aggression or explosive energy.

The composition is balanced and orderly, distributing visual weight evenly without creating any tension, imbalance, or impending collision that could evoke feelings of frustration or hostility. There are no discernible figures or narrative elements that suggest conflict, injustice, or struggle, which are common triggers for anger in art. The brushwork appears controlled and deliberate, rather than frantic, agitated, or impulsive. The overall atmosphere is one of serene contemplation or a stylized abstraction of a peaceful landscape, utterly devoid of any visual cues that might incite or reflect anger."
houses-in-munich-1909.jpg,Cubism,25.5,"The emotion of anger is present, though not dominant, primarily conveyed through the intense and somewhat jarring color palette, characteristic of German Expressionism. The vibrant, almost oppressive red of the buildings, particularly the central one, creates a sensation of heat and tension that can be associated with simmering frustration or suppressed rage. This is reinforced by the thick, bold outlines and the overall simplification of forms, which strip away softer details in favor of raw impact, potentially mirroring an internal state of agitation. The dark, somewhat distorted tree trunks, devoid of leaves, contribute to a stark and unyielding atmosphere that could foster feelings of resentment or harshness. However, the figures themselves do not display overt aggression or angry postures; their simplified forms and somewhat static presence prevent a strong projection of personal anger. While the painting's style evokes a general sense of unease and a direct, unvarnished emotionality, it lacks the explicit visual cues of fury, violent action, or overt confrontation that would signify a higher degree of anger. The feeling is more akin to a latent, environmental tension rather than an explicit outburst of rage."
il-lavoro-1951.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting largely conveys a sense of strenuous effort, collective action, and dynamic movement, rather than anger. There are no discernible facial expressions that suggest rage, frustration, or hostility among the figures; their faces are either obscured or highly stylized, preventing such an interpretation. Similarly, the body language, while depicting intense physical exertion as figures push and pull a large object, appears directed towards the task at hand rather than against another individual or a perceived injustice. There is no visual indication of conflict, aggression, or resentment between any of the depicted characters. The overall composition and color palette are vibrant and energetic, contributing to a feeling of activity and work, not one of discord or violent emotion. While physical strain can sometimes lead to frustration, the painting does not visually translate this into an overt display of anger. The scene lacks any narrative elements, such as confrontation or destruction, that would typically evoke anger in a viewer or suggest it is present within the depicted narrative."
interior-with-balcony-1928.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, ""Woman by the Balcony Playing a Guitar"" by Pablo Picasso, exhibits no visual or thematic elements that evoke a sense of anger. The color palette, while featuring stark contrasts between the dark interior and the bright blue sky, does not utilize hues typically associated with aggression or rage, such as intense reds or chaotic, clashing tones. Instead, the blues, browns, and muted grays contribute to a more contemplative or serene atmosphere.

The subject matter, a figure playing a guitar by a balcony, inherently suggests introspection, calm, or artistic creation rather than conflict or frustration. While the cubist style fragments and distorts the figure and objects, these distortions do not convey a sense of violent upheaval or emotional turmoil indicative of anger. The lines, though angular, are not sharp or aggressive in a way that suggests hostility. The figure's posture, seated and engaged with the instrument, appears composed and absorbed, lacking any tension, clenching, or aggressive stance. There is no depiction of struggle, protest, injustice, or any other narrative content that would incite or reflect anger. The presence of the open balcony and the clear sky, even with a single cloud, lends a feeling of openness and tranquility rather than confinement or agitation. Overall, the visual language of the painting communicates a detached, analytical, or perhaps melancholic mood, but entirely devoid of any resonance with anger."
illustration-for-carmen-1932.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no visual cues within this painting to suggest the emotion of anger. Neither of the two figures displays any physical manifestations typically associated with anger, such as furrowed brows, clenched jaws, bared teeth, aggressive postures, or gestures of frustration or rage. The man seated on the left appears to be intently observing the dancing woman, his expression suggesting awe, concentration, or perhaps a deep emotional connection to her performance, rather than irritation or hostility. His gaze is directed upwards, and his posture is engaged but not tense or aggressive. The woman, caught mid-dance, has her head tilted back and her eyes closed or downcast, conveying a sense of passionate absorption, melancholy, or deep feeling as she performs. Her body is graceful, and her expression is one of emotional intensity, but devoid of any sign of anger or aggression. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of performance, contemplation, or perhaps a shared moment of deep emotion, rather than conflict or animosity. There are no elements in the background, colors, or composition that evoke feelings of anger or discord."
inca-with-birds-1933.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke a sense of anger. The figures' expressions are either neutral or too stylized to convey such a strong emotion; the central figure appears placid, and the figure on the right seems contemplative rather than irate. No tense body language or aggressive postures are depicted. The color palette, composed mainly of earthy browns, ochres, and muted blues, lacks the sharp, fiery, or jarring contrasts often associated with anger. Furthermore, the overall composition and the seemingly ordinary activities of the figures do not suggest conflict, frustration, or any situation that would elicit an angry response from the viewer. The atmosphere is calm and observational, devoid of any visual cues that might trigger or represent anger."
l-oiseau-1915.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting displays no visual cues that would evoke or represent anger. The color palette is bright and harmonious, featuring soft pinks, vibrant yellows, various blues, and a rainbow gradient on the buildings, none of which typically convey aggression or rage. The forms are geometric and clean, lending a sense of order and stylized abstraction rather than chaotic energy or frustration. The central figure of the bird is depicted in a calm, almost serene posture, perched above the abstract cityscape and a large leaf, suggesting peace or contemplation rather than agitation. There are no sharp, jarring lines or aggressive brushstrokes that might indicate conflict or tension. The overall mood is one of whimsical calm, perhaps even a dreamlike tranquility or urban serenity, entirely devoid of any elements commonly associated with anger or its expression."
komposition-med-noter-1921.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke or represent anger. The color palette, while featuring some reds, does not use them in a way that suggests aggression, rage, or irritation; they are integrated harmoniously with other warm and cool tones, contributing to the overall artistic composition rather than conveying emotional intensity. The subject matter, which appears to be a deconstructed still life with musical instruments and sheet music, is inherently associated with creativity, harmony, and contemplation, none of which align with anger. Furthermore, there are no human figures or expressions to project this emotion. The fragmented, cubist-inspired style creates visual interest and intellectual engagement but does not convey conflict, violence, or frustration. The textures and varied materials contribute to the painting's richness but do not carry an aggressive or destructive undertone. The overall impression of the artwork is one of artistic exploration and visual balance, completely devoid of any indication of anger."
kmetty-janos-asztali-csendelet-1910-es-evek-kozepe-37-43.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The emotion of anger is entirely absent from this painting. There are no visual cues in the composition, color palette, brushwork, or subject matter that would evoke or represent feelings of anger. The painting is a still life, traditionally a genre that often conveys serenity, domesticity, or contemplation, and this particular rendition aligns with those qualities. The colors used are muted and harmonious, dominated by cool blues in the background and natural tones for the objects, lacking the harsh, clashing, or fiery hues often associated with anger. The brushwork is controlled and smooth, showing no agitated or aggressive strokes that might convey emotional turmoil. The objects themselves – a bowl of fruit, a bottle, a pitcher, and an apple – are arranged in a balanced and orderly fashion, contributing to a sense of calm rather than disruption or conflict. Furthermore, the framed image in the background depicting two nude figures, reminiscent of classical or biblical themes, shows no signs of aggression, struggle, or angry expressions. Their postures are natural and perhaps introspective, entirely devoid of wrath. Overall, the painting exudes a quiet and contemplative atmosphere, standing in direct opposition to any notion of anger."
la-femme-au-gu-ridon-et-au-fer-cheval-1928.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting exhibits no visual cues or thematic elements that would evoke or suggest anger. The color palette primarily consists of cool, muted blues, grays, and subtle earth tones, which convey a sense of calm, contemplation, or even melancholy, rather than the fiery intensity or heat often associated with anger. There are no vibrant, clashing reds or aggressive dark tones that might signify rage or fury.

Furthermore, the figures depicted are stylized, monumental, and largely expressionless, or possess a pensive, introspective gaze. There are no furrowed brows, clenched fists, tense muscles, or dynamic, aggressive postures that would indicate an angry state. Their forms are rendered with a sculptural, almost static quality, contributing to an overall sense of stillness and order rather than agitation or conflict. The composition itself is balanced and structured, lacking any chaotic lines, sharp angles, or explosive forms that might imply an outburst of emotion. The objects integrated into the scene are inanimate and contribute to the overall contemplative or analytical nature of the work, rather than adding any element of discord or aggression. Consequently, the painting registers a complete absence of any visual or emotional connection to anger."
kuntsevo-cottage-1919.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting largely lacks elements that would typically evoke the emotion of anger. The color palette, dominated by deep blues and greens in the sky and foliage, and earthy yellows and browns for the house, creates a moody and atmospheric scene, but not one of rage or hostility. While the sky might appear somewhat heavy or dramatic, it doesn't convey the agitated, fiery energy often associated with anger. There are no sharp, violent lines, chaotic compositions, or aggressive forms that suggest fury or indignation. The brushstrokes, though visible and expressive, contribute to the texture and a sense of dynamic nature, but they don't appear frantic or forceful in a way that suggests an angry outburst. The subject matter itself—a house nestled within natural surroundings—is inherently placid and does not present any narrative or visual cues of conflict or aggression. The overall impression is more one of introspection, solemnity, or perhaps a somber mood, rather than any form of anger. A very low score is assigned because while the mood is not overtly joyful or peaceful, the elements present do not align with the visual characteristics of anger."
jack-of-hearts.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting displays virtually no explicit or even strongly implied cues for the emotion of anger. The figure's face is highly stylized and geometric, lacking any traditional indicators of anger such as furrowed brows, narrowed eyes, or a tensed jaw or mouth. Its expression is more stoic, almost mask-like, making it difficult to discern specific emotional states. The body language also does not suggest anger; the hand placed over the heart could imply introspection, vulnerability, or even sorrow, but not aggression or rage. While the overall artistic style incorporates sharp angles and jagged forms, particularly in the collar and arm coverings, these appear to be stylistic choices representative of armor or a costume rather than an emotional outpouring. They might convey a sense of rigidity or a defensive posture, but this is distinct from actively experiencing or expressing anger. The presence of the bird, which appears calm, and the abstract red shapes in the background do not contribute to a feeling of anger. Any potential for anger in this piece is extremely subtle and can only be inferred through a highly subjective interpretation of the general severity or sharpness of the forms, which is part of the artistic execution rather than a direct emotional portrayal."
homage-to-gogol-design-for-curtain-for-gogol-festival-1917.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no discernible visual cues within this painting that evoke or represent anger. The central figure's posture, while highly stylized and contorted, appears more acrobatic, reverent (holding a wreath), or whimsical rather than aggressive or enraged. There are no signs of tension, fury, or hostility in the figure's body language or what is visible of its face. The colors used – predominantly bright yellow, black, and red (in the wreath) – do not contribute to a feeling of anger; the yellow is vibrant, and the black provides contrast without conveying menace. The small, idealized building on the figure's foot, and the textual references to ""Gogol"" and ""Magdal(a)/Chagall,"" are elements of artistic symbolism or homage, none of which inherently carry connotations of anger. The overall mood of the painting leans towards surrealism, playfulness, or contemplation, completely devoid of any emotional charge related to anger."
landscape-near-martigues-1908.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The emotion of anger is scarcely present in this painting. The color palette, while bold and somewhat unnatural, does not employ hues typically associated with rage or hostility. The prevalent oranges, deep greens, and blues, though intense, lean more towards an expressive vibrancy rather than an aggressive confrontation. There are no sharp, clashing color juxtapositions that would evoke a sense of visual discord or fury. Furthermore, the brushwork, while discernible and deliberate, does not possess the frantic, agitated, or violent quality that might convey anger. There are no harsh, slashing strokes or chaotic textures. The composition, characterized by simplified, almost geometric forms and clear planes, creates a sense of structured representation rather than one of emotional turmoil or outburst. The subject matter itself – a stylized landscape with fields, trees, and a distant body of water and buildings – is inherently serene and offers no narrative cues of conflict, destruction, or human aggression. There are no figures expressing anger, no signs of disturbance, and no elements that suggest a threatening or hostile environment. The overall impression is one of a simplified, vivid, and somewhat tranquil, albeit abstract, natural scene. Any minimal score might stem from the sheer intensity of color saturation, which for some, could translate to an underlying restlessness, but this is a very indirect and weak association with anger itself."
le-d-jeuner-pr-s-du-phare-1928.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The emotion of anger is scarcely present in this painting. The color palette, predominantly composed of soft pastels – creams, muted purples, light blues, and gentle greens – inherently lacks the intensity and sharp contrasts often associated with aggressive or volatile emotions like anger. There are no fiery reds, stark blacks, or clashing hues that might convey a sense of rage or hostility. Furthermore, the forms and shapes within the artwork are largely curvilinear and organic, even in their abstract distortion. The ""hand"" at the top right, while somewhat imposing in its scale, is rendered with soft edges and lacks any clenched tension or aggressive posture. The stylized utensils, the cup, and the other biomorphic elements are smooth and rounded, devoid of sharp, jagged lines or fragmented shapes that could suggest aggression or an angry outburst. The overall composition is orderly, almost whimsical in its arrangement, rather than chaotic or confrontational. There is no depicted action that implies struggle, violence, or frustration. While the surreal abstraction might evoke a sense of uncanniness or dreaminess, it does not translate into an angry sentiment. The painting's gentle chromatic scheme and fluid forms contribute to a mood that is far removed from any expression of anger, leaning instead towards the meditative or the playfully distorted."
landscape-of-falaise-1910.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting exhibits very minimal elements that could be interpreted as conveying anger. The vibrant and somewhat clashing colors, particularly the bold reds and yellows, while energetic and expressionistic, do not inherently evoke a sense of rage or hostility. They contribute to a lively rather than an aggressive atmosphere. Similarly, the visible brushstrokes, while dynamic and bold, do not appear frenzied, harsh, or violent; instead, they lend a sense of spontaneity and directness to the forms. There are no figures depicted with angry expressions, nor is there any subject matter—such as conflict, destruction, or overt tension—that would typically elicit or represent anger. The overall impression is one of a vibrant landscape, perhaps a little restless due to the energetic style and turbulent sky, but this restlessness is more akin to artistic vitality or atmospheric dynamism than an angry outburst or underlying fury. The composition, while featuring strong diagonal lines from the trees, frames a view that feels more enclosed and intimate than confrontational. Therefore, any perceived anger is extremely subtle and highly abstract, almost negligible, making a very low score appropriate."
lemons-1929.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, a still life featuring a pitcher, a glass, lemons, and a pear arranged on a table, conveys no discernible elements that would evoke or represent anger. The color palette consists primarily of vibrant yellows, earthy browns, and a calming off-white/grey for the plate, none of which inherently carry an angry emotional weight. There are no harsh reds, violent contrasts, or chaotic brushstrokes that might suggest agitation or fury. The composition, while abstract and fragmented in a Cubist-influenced style, maintains a sense of order and contemplation rather than conflict or aggression. The forms are geometric and defined, but not jagged or threatening. The subject matter itself—common household objects and fruit—is inherently benign and does not lend itself to interpretations of rage. There are no figures expressing anger, no violent actions depicted, and no turbulent atmosphere. The overall impression is one of calm, artistic exploration of form and perception, completely devoid of any emotional resonance associated with anger. A minuscule score is assigned only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of a subjective, idiosyncratic interpretation, but objectively, there is no visual cue for this emotion."
head-of-a-man-1908-1.jpg,Cubism,52.5,"The painting, with its stark, fragmented forms and somber color palette, evokes a sense of deep, internalized anger rather than an explosive outburst. The heavy, almost sculptural planes that constitute the head suggest a monumental weight, as if burdened by immense frustration or defiant resolve. The sharp angles and severe lines, particularly around what might be the brow and nose, create a rigid, unyielding quality that resonates with the unbending nature of anger. The predominant use of deep blues and dark, earthy tones contributes to a brooding atmosphere; these are not the fiery reds of rage, but rather the colors of a profound, simmering discontent or a world viewed through eyes hardened by adversity. The abstraction of the face, devoid of conventional features, prevents a direct representation of a grimace or shout, yet the very distortion and deconstruction of the form can be interpreted as a visual representation of internal turmoil and psychological strife that can lead to anger. There is an undeniable severity and confrontational presence to the head, standing like an ancient, defiant sentinel, embodying a stoic yet palpable sense of enduring indignation. The painting does not scream anger, but rather embodies it as a profound, enduring state of being."
landscape-study-for-composition-xii-1918.jpg,Cubism,12.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this artwork. While the use of thick, bold black lines and stark contrast creates a sense of intensity and raw energy, these characteristics do not strongly convey anger. The lines, though forceful, appear more deliberate and structural, forming fragmented architectural shapes rather than chaotic or violent strokes often associated with rage. The dense black masses at the top might evoke a heavy or brooding atmosphere, which could be distantly related to resentment or internal frustration, subtle facets of anger. However, there are no visual cues of aggression, explosive energy, or destructive intent. The composition, while somewhat disorienting due to its fragmentation, does not suggest an outpouring of fury. Therefore, any perceived anger is highly indirect and stems more from a general sense of starkness or an underlying weightiness rather than an active expression of the emotion."
lucky-strike-1921.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The artwork does not evoke any sense of anger. Its composition is highly structured and geometric, characteristic of Cubist or Futurist influences, focusing on form, line, and color as design elements. The colors, while strong (dark green, red, orange, black), are used for their visual impact within the abstract arrangement rather than to convey intense emotion. The lines are clean, deliberate, and organized, lacking the jaggedness, chaotic energy, or aggressive thrusts that might suggest rage or frustration. There are no discernible figures, expressions, or narrative elements that could be interpreted as angry. The overall impression is one of calculated design and commercial promotion, not emotional turmoil or aggression."
love-1910.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The image, titled ""L'Amour"" (Love), strongly depicts intimacy and peaceful togetherness between two figures nestled within a lush, natural setting. There are absolutely no visual cues that would evoke anger. The figures are embracing in a tender manner, with serene or closed-eye expressions that suggest contentment or passion, rather than any form of aggression or displeasure. Their body language is one of comfort and closeness, not tension or conflict. The surrounding foliage and flowers contribute to an overall atmosphere of tranquility and natural harmony. The bold black and white contrast of the linocut/woodcut medium, while stark, is used to define organic shapes and textures rather than convey harshness or rage. There are no sharp, jagged lines that might suggest violence, no distorted features expressing wrath, nor any chaotic elements in the composition. Every element in the print works against the emotion of anger, making its presence negligible, if not entirely absent. The score is marginally above zero to acknowledge the subjective nature of interpretation, but effectively, there is no anger conveyed."
landscape.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The painting registers an extremely low score for anger. There are no direct visual cues typically associated with this emotion, such as aggressive figures, violent actions, sharp and clashing red or orange hues, or expressions of frustration or rage. The subject matter itself—a landscape with houses—does not inherently suggest anger. The overall atmosphere is more dramatic, brooding, or perhaps melancholic due to the heavy, dark trees and the turbulent, stormy sky.

However, a very slight and abstract element that might contribute to a fractional score is the raw, visible, and somewhat energetic brushwork, particularly in the sky and the dense, dark foliage. This turbulent quality, coupled with the dark, heavy clouds and looming trees, creates an intense and forceful natural environment. If one were to personify nature, this stormy scene could be metaphorically described as an ""angry"" sky or a ""brooding"" landscape, conveying a sense of untamed, forceful energy. This is a highly indirect and metaphorical interpretation of anger, applying it to natural phenomena rather than human emotion. The painting does not evoke any sense of human fury, resentment, or aggression, making any connection to anger very tenuous and primarily atmospheric."
man-and-woman-1926.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, with its abstract and simplified forms, does not evoke any discernible sense of anger. The predominant colors—a calm, deep blue background, a pure, stark white for the central figure, and a grounding, soft pink-red base—are not typically associated with rage or hostility. The forms themselves are smooth and elongated, lacking any jagged edges, aggressive lines, or dynamic tension that might convey agitation or fury. The central figure appears static and almost sculptural, while the faint, shadowy figures on either side recede into the background, appearing contemplative or observing rather than confrontational. There is an overall sense of serenity, detachment, and perhaps spiritual or ethereal contemplation, which is antithetical to the raw energy and turbulence typically associated with anger. The composition is balanced and orderly, contributing to a feeling of stillness rather than emotional upheaval. Any minute score above zero would only account for the extremely remote possibility of a subjective, highly idiosyncratic interpretation, but objectively, there are no visual cues to support an emotional response of anger."
marika-with-her-dog-and-cats-1968.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting presents an overwhelmingly serene and harmonious scene, completely devoid of any elements that might evoke or suggest anger. The central figure, a woman, is depicted in a state of tranquil repose, reading a book, with a calm and contemplative expression. Her posture is relaxed, and the flowing green drapery around her adds to the sense of peacefulness. The animals in the painting—a black cat resting on her lap, a brown dog curled up on the floor, and another cat grooming itself—all appear content and at ease, reinforcing the domestic tranquility. The surrounding environment, with its lush green foliage and delicate white flowers, further contributes to a natural and calming atmosphere. There are no signs of conflict, tension, frustration, or any agitated energy in the subjects' expressions, body language, or the overall composition. The color palette is soothing, dominated by greens, and there are no jarring or aggressive tones. The brushwork is gentle, and the subject matter itself is one of quietude and introspection. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing within this artwork that could be interpreted as evoking or representing the emotion of anger."
madonna.jpg,Cubism,7.5,"The painting is an abstract composition primarily made up of fragmented geometric shapes and varying colors, including some patterned sections that resemble fabric or wallpaper. There are no discernible figures, explicit narratives, or recognizable objects that would typically convey anger through expression, posture, or action. The overall aesthetic is one of dynamic formal exploration rather than emotional expression.

While some elements, such as the prominent use of deep reds and blacks in certain areas, could be loosely associated with intensity or somberness, they are integrated within a broad and often vibrant palette that includes light blues, greens, yellows, and pinks. These brighter colors counteract any potential somber or aggressive mood that the darker tones might otherwise suggest. The sharp angles and fragmented forms create a sense of movement and energetic disjunction, but this fragmentation does not inherently translate to aggression or rage; rather, it's a characteristic of the Cubist-inspired abstract style. There are no chaotic or jarring brushstrokes that might imply agitation, nor any visual cues that suggest conflict, tension, or violence. The presence of decorative patterns further softens any potential harshness, adding a textural and somewhat playful quality that is antithetical to anger. Therefore, the visual language of the painting does not strongly align with the emotion of anger, leading to a very low score."
men-in-the-city-1919.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting, ""Two Figures"" by Fernand Léger, is a prime example of Purism and Cubism, focusing on the decomposition and re-composition of forms into geometric shapes, cylinders, and blocks. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest or evoke anger. The figures are highly abstract and de-individualized, lacking any facial expressions or body language that could convey this emotion. The composition, while dynamic in its use of overlapping and intersecting forms, maintains a sense of order and balance rather than chaos or agitation. The color palette consists of primary colors and earth tones, used in a clean, block-like manner that contributes to the structured, almost industrial aesthetic, rather than conveying any fiery or aggressive sentiment. There are no depictions of conflict, struggle, or violent action. The overall impression is one of formal exploration, stability, and a calculated, intellectual approach to representation, completely devoid of any emotional charge related to anger."
machinery.jpg,Cubism,18.0,"The presence of anger in this painting is very low and primarily suggested through subtle, internalized tension rather than overt expression. The central human face, fragmented and integrated with mechanical elements, displays an intense, direct gaze. While this gaze is unblinking and carries a degree of severity, it lacks the typical visual cues associated with explicit anger such as furrowed brows, a scowling mouth, clenched teeth, or reddened skin. Instead, the expression conveys a stoic concentration, a profound awareness, or perhaps a contained frustration related to the complex, mechanistic environment surrounding it. There is no depiction of violent action, aggression, or chaotic disruption within the industrial scene. The colors, while bold and industrial (with significant use of red), are applied in a structured manner to define machinery, not to evoke heated emotional states. The robotic figures are emotionless and functional, adding to a sense of controlled, albeit perhaps overwhelming, industry rather than one of conflict or rage. Any perceived anger is deeply subdued, an underlying current of tension or a quiet, internalized struggle against or within the depicted mechanical reality, rather than an active or expressed emotion."
man-s-head.jpg,Cubism,68.0,"The painting conveys a notable degree of anger, primarily through the intense and direct gaze of the subject. The large, wide, and unblinking eyes, with their prominent dark pupils, meet the viewer's gaze with an unsettling intensity that can be interpreted as confrontational or seething. The heavy, dark lines defining the brows add a sense of weight and a subtle furrow, suggesting displeasure or a troubled mind. Furthermore, the fragmented and angular planes of the face, particularly around the cheeks and nose, along with the visible, strong brushstrokes and sharp contrasts in color, create a feeling of tension and disquiet. The cross-hatching patterns on the forehead and cheeks enhance this sense of internal turmoil or psychological fracturing, which is often associated with the agitation and stress of anger. While the mouth is not overtly expressing rage (like a snarl or yell), its somewhat compressed and dark form does not detract from the overall intensity conveyed by the eyes and the fractured facial structure. This suggests a more internalized or simmering anger, rather than an explosive outburst, contributing to a sense of brooding intensity and contained frustration."
nature-morte-1926.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, a Cubist still life, offers very few visual cues that would typically evoke or express anger. The composition is highly structured and geometric, characteristic of Cubism, which often prioritizes intellectual deconstruction and multiple perspectives over raw emotional expression. The lines are controlled and precise, lacking the chaotic, frenetic, or aggressive qualities often associated with anger. The color palette consists primarily of muted tones—browns, blues, blacks, whites, and ochre—none of which are inherently associated with rage, and there is an absence of vibrant, clashing reds or sharp, discordant contrasts that might convey an angry emotional state. The subject matter, a guitar and a bottle, is benign and typical of still life, offering no violent or disturbing imagery. While the Star of David symbol is present at the bottom, which can carry historical weight and associations with persecution that might evoke anger in a viewer, its depiction within the painting is rendered with the same cool, geometric precision as the other objects. It is an intellectual or symbolic inclusion rather than an emotionally charged visual outburst. The overall mood appears more contemplative, intellectual, or perhaps somber, rather than overtly angry or agitated. Therefore, the painting's visual language and stylistic approach do not project or invite a strong sense of anger."
not_detected_227965.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke feelings of anger. The scene depicts a peaceful, perhaps idyllic, rural or semi-rural setting with a town, a church, and gardens where a person is engaged in what appears to be agricultural labor. The colors are vibrant and inviting, dominated by greens, yellows, and warm earthy tones. The composition is structured and harmonious, without any visual tension or discord. There are no depicted conflicts, injustices, or expressions of frustration or aggression from any figures. The overall mood of the artwork is one of calm and industrious tranquility, completely devoid of any visual cues that would suggest or provoke anger."
militiaman-and-merchant-sketch-of-costumes-for-the-play-footballer.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting, ""An Englishman in Moscow"" by Kazimir Malevich, is a prime example of Cubo-Futurism, characterized by its fragmented forms, geometric abstraction, and symbolic juxtapositions rather than direct emotional expression. There are very few elements within the artwork that evoke or depict anger.

The two figures are highly stylized and symbolic, lacking realistic human expressions that would convey rage or frustration. The ""Englishman"" figure, dressed in a uniform, has a segmented, mask-like face with a distinct mustache. While his stance is upright and somewhat rigid, it conveys formality or presence rather than aggression or anger. His eyes are abstract and do not show any signs of fury or agitation.

The second, more abstract figure with the long nose and a body composed of red and green shapes, also shows no overt signs of anger. Its face, with circular cheeks and a blue/grey forehead, is more enigmatic than expressive of a specific emotion like anger. The raised hand could be interpreted as a gesture of communication or explanation, but not as a clenched fist or an aggressive movement. The bee/fly emblem on its chest is symbolic, not indicative of anger.

The color palette, while featuring bold reds and greens, does not use these colors in a way that suggests emotional turmoil or rage. The overall composition creates a sense of intellectual curiosity and symbolic encounter, rather than a heated confrontation. The alogical nature of the elements aims to provoke thought and re-evaluation of reality, not to elicit a visceral emotional response like anger. There are no dynamic lines, aggressive postures, or facial expressions that would typically signify this emotion. Any perceived tension is likely intellectual or symbolic, not emotionally charged with anger."
milliners-workshop-of-the-milliner-1926.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting, rendered in a monochromatic palette of grays, blacks, and whites, does not visually convey the emotion of anger. There are no vibrant or aggressive colors typically associated with rage, such as reds or sharp, clashing hues. The fragmented and geometric forms, characteristic of Cubism, create an intellectual and analytical atmosphere rather than an emotionally charged one.

The figures depicted, though abstracted, do not exhibit facial expressions or body language indicative of anger. Their features are stylized, making it impossible to discern a scowl, a furrowed brow, or any form of grimace. Gestures, such as the hand reaching towards the doorway on the right, appear to be actions of engagement or contemplation rather than aggression or frustration. There are no clenched fists, violent movements, or signs of conflict or destruction.

While the sharp angles and fractured planes inherent in Cubist works can sometimes imply a sense of tension or psychological complexity, this tension is not specifically channeled towards anger in this particular composition. The overall mood appears somber, reflective, or perhaps even melancholic, but not angry. There is an absence of the dynamic, confrontational energy or overt symbolism that would typically communicate this strong emotion. The scene feels more like a quiet deconstruction of perception than an expression of internal turmoil or outward rage."
metronome.jpg,Cubism,15.0,"The painting, a Cubist/Futurist work by Fernand Léger, does not overtly convey a strong sense of anger. Its visual language is primarily focused on the fragmented depiction of modernity, industry, and international connections rather than emotional expression of rage.

While the composition is dynamic and disjointed, characterized by sharp angles and interlocking mechanical forms, this fragmentation is more a stylistic choice to capture the speed and complexity of the machine age than a deliberate evocation of anger. The forms themselves, though bold, appear more analytical and structured than chaotic or destructive.

The color palette consists of deep purples, blues, yellows, and some reds. While red can be associated with anger and deep purples with brooding, their usage here feels more about creating a vibrant, albeit stark, visual rhythm rather than expressing a violent or furious emotional state. There are no clashing, aggressive color combinations that would typically signify rage.

Furthermore, there are no human figures depicted with expressions of anger, nor does the narrative content explicitly suggest conflict, injustice, or a cause for outrage. The scattered text, including names of countries (""FRANCE,"" ""ANGLETERRE,"" ""AMERIQUE"") and cities (""PARIS""), along with numerical data and a question mark, suggests a reflection on the international and industrial landscape. The question mark might imply uncertainty or inquiry, which could lead to frustration for some, but it does not directly express anger.

Any perception of anger would likely stem from a viewer's personal interpretation of the cold, impersonal nature of machinery or the potential alienation of modernity, rather than from explicit visual cues presented by the artist within the painting itself. The overall impression is one of intellectual observation and formal experimentation, rather"
night-ceremony.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting conveys no discernible sense of anger. There are no angry figures, no expressions of rage or frustration visible in the man or the overall scene. The colors are muted and earthy, lacking the harsh, aggressive tones often associated with anger. The composition, while detailed and busy, does not possess a chaotic or violent energy that would suggest wrath. While the subject matter involves the preparation of raw meat and possibly butchery, the act itself is depicted as a methodical process, devoid of any emotional charge of aggression or animosity. The atmosphere is one of diligent labor rather than conflict or fury. Therefore, the emotion of anger is entirely absent from the painting's visual language and narrative."
no-name-2(1).jpg,Cubism,83.0,"The painting strongly conveys anger through the dynamic and forceful poses of the human figures. Their bodies are depicted with clear muscular tension and strain, particularly visible in the arms, legs, and torsos, suggesting intense physical exertion or a struggle. The figures' mouths are open, implying shouting, screaming, or roaring, which are common outward expressions of anger. For instance, the leftmost figure has an arm raised in what appears to be a powerful gesture, and its head is thrown back with an open mouth, indicative of a forceful vocalization of emotion. Similarly, the rightmost figure's arms are flung upwards, head back, and mouth open in a seemingly guttural cry. The chaotic and intertwined composition of the humans and horses further emphasizes a sense of violent struggle or confrontation, a context in which anger is a dominant emotion. The overall energy of the painting is one of agitated, aggressive, and possibly desperate, rage. While the specific target or cause of the anger is open to interpretation within the narrative of the struggle, the physical manifestations of the figures unequivocally express an intense, forceful, and volatile emotional state consistent with anger."
mountaineers-attacked-by-bears-1912.jpg,Cubism,15.0,"The painting, with its fragmented forms, sharp angles, and crowded composition, certainly conveys a sense of unease, psychological tension, and perhaps a distorted reality. This inherent harshness and disquiet could be seen as conditions that might evoke frustration or even anger. However, direct visual representations of the emotion of anger are largely absent. There are"
nu-au-soleil-nude-in-the-sun-1935.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no discernible elements that convey anger. The figure's facial expression, while somewhat serious or solemn due to the slightly furrowed brow and direct gaze, lacks the characteristic intensity, tension, or distortion associated with anger such as a grimace, flared nostrils, or piercing, enraged eyes. Instead, her gaze appears pensive or introspective rather than confrontational or wrathful. Her body language is relaxed and self-contained, with arms resting casually and legs crossed, indicating repose or contemplation rather than agitation, aggression, or readiness for conflict. There are no clenched fists, rigid postures, or dynamic, explosive lines that might suggest underlying rage. Furthermore, the overall color palette is muted and earthy, contributing to a calm and contemplative atmosphere rather than the fiery or harsh tones often used to depict strong negative emotions. The surrounding elements, such as the distant landscape, the calm indoor setting, and the still life objects (flowers, fruit bowl), reinforce a sense of tranquility and order. Any perceived hint of sternness is extremely subtle and far from registering as genuine anger."
orange-vendor-spain.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this artwork. There are no direct visual cues that suggest rage, frustration, or aggression. The central figure's face is highly stylized and lacks any discernible expression of anger, such as a furrowed brow, scowl, or tense jawline. Her eyes are downcast, and her mouth is a simple, closed line, conveying a sense of stoicism or quiet focus rather than agitation. The fragmented and geometric rendering of her body, typical of Cubist-inspired art, emphasizes form and motion rather than emotional states. While there are bold and contrasting colors, including shades of red and deep purple, they are used decoratively and rhythmically across the composition, contributing to a vibrant and dynamic aesthetic rather than evoking a sense of fury or hostility. The overall impression is one of a figure engaged in activity (carrying produce), and the artistic treatment focuses on the visual deconstruction and reassembly of the form, not on expressing internal turmoil or outward aggression. There are no sharp, violent lines or chaotic brushstrokes that would typically signify an angry outburst. The raised hand, while a gesture, is open and lacks any aggressive posture or tension. Therefore, the painting offers almost no elements that would elicit or depict anger in the viewer or the subject."
peasant-woman-with-buckets-and-a-child.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The visual elements within this painting offer very little direct evidence of anger. The primary figures, a woman carrying a heavy load and a child, display facial expressions that are more indicative of weariness, stoicism, or perhaps a profound sadness. Their eyes are large and somewhat vacant, with a downcast or resigned quality to their gaze, rather than the narrowed, intense look typically associated with anger. There are no furrowed brows, clenched jaws, or tense muscles that would communicate rage or frustration. The woman's posture, though burdened, suggests endurance and labor, not an aggressive stance or defiant fury. Her hands are open and relaxed, not clenched into fists. The muted, earthy color palette also contributes to a somber, perhaps melancholic, atmosphere rather than one of fiery indignation or explosive emotion. While the subject matter hints at hardship and a difficult life, which might *lead* to anger in real-world contexts, the emotion itself is not explicitly portrayed or conveyed through the artistic choices. The overall impression is one of quiet suffering and resilience, far removed from an outward display of anger. A very low score is warranted because anger is virtually absent as a depicted emotion."
pillars-of-salt.jpg,Cubism,5.2,"The painting displays virtually no explicit or implicit visual cues that evoke or depict anger. The figures themselves are stylized and somewhat abstract, resembling ancient statues or totems, with calm and stoic countenances. The figure on the far right even has a gentle, almost benevolent smile, directly counteracting any sense of rage or aggression. Their postures are still, with hands clasped or held in positions that suggest contemplation, reverence, or resignation, rather than tension or hostility. There is no dynamic movement, aggressive interaction, or confrontational body language among them.

While the background features strong, contrasting colors—deep reds and oranges against dark blues and purples, rendered with jagged, almost lightning-like strokes—which could individually imply intensity or turmoil, these elements do not translate into anger emanating from the figures. The figures stand calmly within this dramatic environment, appearing detached or perhaps enduring, but not actively angry. The overall mood conveyed is one of solemnity, ancient wisdom, or perhaps melancholy, but certainly not one dominated by rage or fury. The score is not zero because the strong background colors and sharp lines could be interpreted by some as a subtle reflection of internal turmoil or external forces, which *might* be linked to anger in a very abstract and indirect way, but this connection is weak and not personified by the subjects."
paris-roofs-ii-1952.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of anger, I find no discernible elements within this painting that would evoke such a response. The palette is composed of muted, harmonious pastels—soft greens, beiges, blues, and purples—which are inherently calming rather than aggressive or jarring. There is an absolute absence of the vibrant, clashing reds, deep tumultuous browns, or stark, high-contrast tones typically associated with rage or conflict. The composition is highly geometric and abstract, featuring clean, straight lines and orderly, interlocking shapes. These precise and controlled forms suggest structure and intellectual arrangement rather than chaos, violence, or emotional upheaval. There is no frantic or agitated brushwork; the surface appears evenly painted, further contributing to a sense of serenity and quiet contemplation. Furthermore, the abstract subject matter offers no narrative content—such as scenes of injustice, destruction, or distressed figures—that would commonly trigger anger. The overall impression is one of compositional study, balance, and quietude, entirely devoid of any visual cues or inherent tension that might lead to an angry emotional response."
pink-figure-wizard.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. The figure's highly stylized face, with its simple line for a mouth and abstracted eyes, displays no typical indicators of rage, frustration, or aggression such as a furrowed brow, tensed jaw, or a grimace. The posture of the figure is upright and somewhat rigid, but it lacks any dynamism or tension that might suggest an aggressive stance. The color palette, composed mainly of earthy browns, cool greens, and blues, is not one typically associated with the fiery or intense emotions of anger. There are no harsh contrasts or chaotic brushstrokes that would evoke a feeling of turmoil or agitation. Instead, the overall impression is one of stillness, contemplation, or perhaps a detached stoicism, entirely devoid of any overt or underlying anger. The minimal score acknowledges the abstract nature of the work, which might obscure a fleeting hint, but ultimately, anger is unequivocally absent from the emotional landscape presented."
portrait-of-a-stylist-germinal-rangel.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger whatsoever. The central figure's expression is calm, almost serene, with soft features and a placid gaze that conveys introspection or gentle contemplation, rather than any form of agitation or fury. There are no furrowed brows, clenched jaws, or tense muscles that would indicate anger. Their posture is relaxed and open, seated calmly with hands resting gently, completely devoid of any aggressive or confrontational body language. The color palette, composed predominantly of soft blues, greens, and warm earth tones applied in a pointillist style, creates a harmonious and tranquil atmosphere. There are no harsh reds, sharp contrasts, or discordant elements that might stir feelings of aggression or resentment. Furthermore, the surrounding elements—a peaceful landscape with palm trees and wildflowers, a calm Siamese cat, a small tortoise, and a still life of fruit—all contribute to an overall mood of peace, domesticity, and natural tranquility. Nothing in the composition, subject matter, or artistic execution suggests any form of anger, either as an emotion felt by the subject or as an emotion intended to be provoked in the viewer. The miniscule score acknowledges the theoretical impossibility of a perfect zero in artistic interpretation, but practically speaking, anger is entirely absent here."
portrait-de-j-l-b.jpg,Cubism,5.7,"The painting evokes only a very minimal sense of anger. The primary reason for any score above zero stems from the visual depiction of what could be interpreted as a fragmented human or humanoid form seemingly trapped or compressed within sharp, converging geometric planes. The downward-pointing triangular and angular forms, especially those in darker shades surrounding the central, lighter, and more complex shapes, create a sense of pressure or constriction. This visual metaphor for being overwhelmed, constrained, or 'cut into' by external forces could elicit a subtle, internal feeling of frustration or indignation in the viewer, which are components on the spectrum of anger. It suggests a situation where something is being suppressed or distorted against its will.

However, the emotion of anger is far from dominant. There are no vibrant, aggressive colors (like intense reds) typically associated with rage, nor is there any chaotic, violent, or explosive brushwork. The overall mood is more somber, contemplative, or melancholic, rather than overtly confrontational or furious. The potential for anger is therefore very low, existing only as a faint echo of indignation at a perceived visual 'wrong' or discomfort, rather than any direct, palpable sense of fury or resentment."
portrait-dulcinea-1911.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The emotion of anger is almost entirely absent from this painting. The figures, while abstracted, exhibit no discernible facial expressions or body language that would convey rage, frustration, or hostility. Their stylized features appear either serene, introspective, or simply neutral, with eyes often downcast or gazing vaguely, far from the intense focus or furrowed brows associated with anger. The overall composition, characterized by interlocking and flowing forms, creates a sense of unity and quiet contemplation rather than conflict or aggression. Furthermore, the dominant color palette of warm, earthy yellows, oranges, and browns, with soft transitions and gentle highlights, contributes to a harmonious and somewhat tranquil atmosphere. There are no sharp, clashing colors or aggressive brushstrokes that might suggest underlying tension or explosive emotion. The angularity inherent in the painting's style serves more to define form and structure than to imbue the scene with sharp edges of hostility. Consequently, any interpretation of anger would be a significant overreach of what the visual elements convey, placing its presence at a negligible level."
planches-de-salut-1931.jpg,Cubism,3.0,"The artwork exhibits an almost complete absence of overt anger. There are no figures depicted with angry expressions or aggressive postures, nor are there any violent or destructive actions occurring within the scene. The precise and meticulous hatching and cross-hatching, while creating stark contrasts and a sense of depth, convey a controlled and deliberate atmosphere rather than a furious or chaotic outburst. The lines are analytical and structured, lacking the frenetic energy or raw, gestural marks often associated with the emotion of anger in art.

While the phrase ""Planches de Salut"" (Boards/Planks of Salvation) might hint at a challenging or desperate situation from which one seeks rescue, and such a predicament *could* potentially evoke frustration, the image itself does not visually manifest this frustration as anger. The overall mood is more one of introspection, stark observation, or perhaps a somber sense of passage or enclosure, distinct from the outward force or internal turmoil that typifies anger. The architectural elements and the static, stylized figure (if indeed it is a figure) suggest a contemplative or mysterious atmosphere, devoid of any visual cues that directly communicate rage, aggression, or indignation."
portrait-of-albert-gleizes-1912.jpg,Cubism,12.0,"The emotion of anger is largely absent from this painting. The Cubist style, characterized by the fragmentation and reassembly of forms, inherently works against the clear conveyance of strong, direct emotional expressions like anger. The subject's face is broken into geometric planes, making it impossible to discern traditional indicators of anger such as a furrowed brow, narrowed eyes, or a scowl. While the visible eye on the right side of the face (viewer's left) has a certain intensity or directness, it does not convey rage or fury. The color palette is composed of muted grays, blacks, and browns, with some warmer yellows and a touch of purple, none of which are typically associated with the fiery or confrontational aspects of anger. The sharp angles and fractured composition could, at a stretch, be interpreted as suggesting tension or internal discord, which might be a distant precursor to anger, but this is an intellectual rather than an emotional interpretation. There is no sense of aggression, agitation, or hostile intent emanating from the figure. The painting feels more like an analytical study of form and perspective than a vehicle for profound emotional display, leaving very little room for an explicit or even strongly implied sense of anger."
portrait-of-manuel-pallares-1909.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting exhibits extremely minimal indicators of anger. The Cubist style, characterized by its sharp angles and fragmented planes, primarily serves an intellectual and structural purpose rather than an emotional one. While the angularity could, in a highly abstract interpretation, suggest a certain rigidity or sternness in the subject's demeanor, there are no overt visual cues typically associated with anger. The man's face lacks the furrowed brow, narrowed eyes, tensed mouth, or aggressive expression that would clearly convey this emotion. His gaze appears contemplative or perhaps somber, rather than enraged or hostile. The muted color palette of grays, browns, and ochres also does not contribute to a sense of heated emotion. The overall impression is one of analytical deconstruction and intellectual intensity, rather than raw, visceral anger. Any perceived tension stems more from the stylistic fragmentation than from an emotional state of rage or fury. Therefore, while the sharp lines might convey a lack of softness, they do not directly translate into an expression of anger."
portrait-of-the-writer-m-doleng-1929.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting does not significantly evoke the emotion of anger. The seated figure's posture appears contemplative and inward-focused, rather than tense or aggressive. His gaze is directed downwards, obscuring any direct visual cues of anger in his eyes, which are often central to conveying this emotion. The hands are clasped or resting calmly, showing no signs of clenching or tension typically associated with frustration or rage. While the artistic style utilizes sharp, angular lines and distinct color planes, notably some red on the face, this appears to be a characteristic of the chosen artistic movement (e.g., Cubism or Expressionism) rather than a literal representation of a flushed face or a distorted expression of fury. There are no dynamic or explosive elements, harsh brushstrokes, or confrontational stances that would typically signify anger. The overall mood conveyed leans more towards introspection, solemnity, or perhaps a subdued thoughtfulness, offering very little visual evidence to suggest a strong presence of anger in either the subject's demeanor or the painting's atmosphere. Any perception of anger would be extremely subtle and indirect, stemming more from the general unease that fragmented styles can sometimes impart, rather than a specific portrayal of this emotion."
purim.jpg,Cubism,5.2,"The painting exhibits a negligible level of anger. None of the figures display explicit signs of this emotion through their facial expressions or body language. The central male figure walks with an open posture, seemingly engaged in an exchange or journey, with no indication of aggression or fury. His hand is open, and his mouth is slightly ajar, possibly in song or conversation, rather than a snarl. The woman on the left, holding a dish, appears to be in a posture of offering or receiving, her focus on the object she carries, without any visible tension or resentment. The seated woman on the right has a more ambiguous expression, appearing perhaps weary, sad, or resigned, with wide eyes and a slightly downturned mouth. While her countenance might suggest hardship or distress, it does not convey an active or simmering anger. There are no clenched fists, raised voices (implied visually), or confrontational stances among the characters. Furthermore, the overall composition and the somewhat dreamlike, folkloric style of Chagall tend to soften sharp emotional depictions unless they are the specific subject. The dominant red-orange background, while a strong color, acts more as a vibrant stage for the figures rather than an indicator of a volatile or angry atmosphere; in Chagall's work, such colors often denote passion, spiritual energy, or the warmth of memory, rather than rage. The interaction depicted seems to be a daily, perhaps humble, exchange within a community, devoid of any conflict that would evoke anger."
rain-1929.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting, characteristic of Cubism, primarily employs geometric fragmentation and a muted color palette, none of which directly evoke anger. The dominant browns, teals, greys, and whites are cool or earthy tones, starkly lacking the intense reds or fiery oranges often associated with feelings of rage or aggression. While the composition is broken into sharp, angular planes, this appears to be a stylistic choice for analytical deconstruction rather than an expression of emotional turmoil or destructive force. There are no frantic brushstrokes, distorted figures, or narrative elements that suggest conflict, frustration, or a sense of wrath. The forms, whether representing a vessel or loaves of bread, are rendered with a sense of deliberate structure rather than agitated chaos. The overall impression is one of intellectual exploration and contemplative stillness, making the presence of anger negligible. Any interpretation of anger would be extremely tangential, possibly relating to a very abstract sense of rigidity or abruptness from the sharp lines, but this connection is so weak as to be almost non-existent in the emotional impact of the piece."
relief.jpg,Cubism,68.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of agitation, tension, and a forceful energy, which are closely related to the emotion of anger. The fragmented, angular shapes and sharp lines throughout the composition create a visual discord and lack of harmony. This fragmentation suggests a breaking apart or a state of conflict. The prominent use of red, particularly in the upper and central parts, is a color traditionally associated with passion, aggression, and anger. This is juxtaposed with sharp white and black areas, creating high contrast that adds to the visual ""noise"" and intensity. The dynamic and seemingly chaotic arrangement of forms, where elements appear to be pushing against each other or exploding outwards, contributes to an overall feeling of unrest and potential aggression. There is no softness, fluidity, or serenity present; instead, the rigid, almost metallic-like forms convey a sense of harshness and rigidity, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of pent-up force or outward outburst. While not depicting an angry subject directly, the formal elements of the painting successfully transmit an energetic, clashing, and somewhat confrontational atmosphere that aligns significantly with the emotional experience of anger."
red-jew-1915.jpg,Cubism,12.5,"The emotion of anger is present in this painting to a very limited and ambiguous degree. There are no overt signs of rage, fury, or aggressive tension in the subject's facial expression or body language. The man's posture is slumped and weary, with his hands resting passively, suggesting resignation or deep fatigue rather than agitation or hostility. His face, while heavily lined and somewhat gaunt, does not display a typical angry scowl or grimace. One eye is squinted or narrowed, which *could* be interpreted as a subtle hint of displeasure, annoyance, or a critical gaze, elements that are sometimes associated with a subdued form of anger or irritation. However, this interpretation is not definitive and could just as easily be attributed to weariness, sadness, or the effects of age. The vibrant red color of the beard, while symbolically associated with passion and sometimes anger, does not directly translate to the man's emotional state in this depiction, as his expression lacks the intensity that would typically accompany such a symbolic visual cue of anger. Overall, any sense of anger is extremely muted and highly open to other interpretations, making it a very minor component of the emotional landscape presented."
san-giacomo-di-varallo-1924.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, a landscape depicting a village with a bridge and a river, offers virtually no visual cues that would evoke a sense of anger. The color palette consists of earthy tones—muted greens, browns, ochres, and soft reds for the rooftops—which are inherently calming and natural, rather than aggressive or dissonant. There are no harsh, vibrant, or clashing colors typically associated with strong negative emotions like anger. The brushwork, while visible and somewhat textured, is not frenetic, chaotic, or violent; it appears deliberate and structured, contributing to the solidity of the forms rather than suggesting agitation. The composition is stable and balanced, with geometric forms that convey a sense of order and permanence, rather than instability or conflict. There are no human figures or narrative elements that could imply struggle, injustice, or any situation that would incite anger. The scene is devoid of any dramatic action, explicit tension, or destructive elements. The overall atmosphere is one of stillness and quiet contemplation, leaning more towards a sense of peacefulness or perhaps a subtle melancholy, but certainly not anger. The minimal score acknowledges the subjective nature of emotional response, but fundamentally, the aesthetic properties and subject matter of this artwork are antithetical to the emotion of anger."
red-ocean-blue-1915.jpg,Cubism,38.0,"The painting exhibits a moderate level of potential anger, primarily conveyed through the prominent, open, and somewhat distorted mouth-like feature in the lower central part of the face. This can be interpreted as a shout or scream, a common vocal manifestation of intense anger or frustration. Furthermore, the fragmented and disjointed nature of the facial elements, along with the sharp, angular shapes, creates a sense of internal disarray and tension. This underlying agitation, while not explicitly depicting rage, suggests a state of emotional turmoil where anger could be present or simmering. The rough, energetic brushwork, particularly in the dark, almost chaotic background, contributes to an overall feeling of raw, unrestrained emotional expression. While direct visual cues like furrowed brows or an aggressive glare are absent, the combination of a potential scream and the agitated, fractured aesthetic allows for a plausible, albeit not overwhelming, interpretation of anger."
return-from-field-work.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting shows virtually no discernible elements that directly or strongly convey anger. The overall color palette is bright and varied, incorporating yellows, oranges, blues, greens, and pinks, none of which are predominantly associated with the emotion of rage or hostility. While there are sharp, angular black outlines and two prominent black star-like shapes at the top, these primarily serve to define the fragmented, Cubist-inspired composition and provide visual contrast, rather than symbolize aggression or fury. The figures depicted do not exhibit any facial expressions or body language indicative of anger, such as furrowed brows, clenched fists, or aggressive postures. The woman on the left appears to be gesturing with open hands, perhaps in a state of surprise, wonder, or performance. The figure on the right, lying down, has an open mouth that suggests singing, laughing, or shouting in exuberance, not in anger. The presence of cows and elements that might relate to a bullfight are highly stylized and lack any depiction of violence or conflict that would evoke an angry response. The overall mood is dynamic and energetic, but lacks any visual cues that communicate a sense of rage, frustration, or hostility. Any hint of anger would be an extremely abstract and forced interpretation of the painting's formal qualities, rather than an evident emotional message."
portrait-of-p-denike-yuriev-and-a-pokrovsky-1913.jpg,Cubism,12.5,"The depiction within this painting offers very little to suggest the emotion of anger. Neither of the figures exhibits common visual indicators of rage or hostility. The man on the left, while looking directly forward, possesses an enigmatic and somewhat stern expression, but his brow is not furrowed in a scowl, his eyes are not narrowed in fury, nor is his mouth contorted into an angry grimace or snarl. His hands rest calmly, showing no sign of clenching or tension often associated with anger. The man on the right, portrayed in profile, appears more contemplative or engaged in observation, with no features indicating aggression. His mouth is slightly open, suggesting speech or a thoughtful pause, rather than a yell or a bared-teeth expression of wrath. While the bold, somewhat stark style and angular features could lend themselves to conveying strong emotions, the specific lines and forms used here do not coalesce into a portrayal of anger. The color palette, though vibrant and contrasting, does not inherently convey rage or violent emotion. The overall impression is one of psychological depth or detached seriousness rather than overt anger or agitation."
rush-hour.jpg,Cubism,68.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of tension, discord, and agitated energy through its fragmented forms, sharp angles, and dynamic composition. The multitude of overlapping, jagged planes and lines creates a visual ""clash"" that can be interpreted as confrontational and aggressive. There's a pervasive feeling of things being broken apart, disrupted, or in a state of chaotic collision, which aligns with the destructive or forceful aspects often associated with anger. While the color palette lacks vibrant, traditionally ""angry"" reds or oranges, the dominance of muted browns, grays, and dark greens, coupled with the harsh geometric forms, contributes to an unsettling and somber mood rather than softening the visual impact. The overall chaotic and disorienting arrangement of elements suggests an underlying frustration or turmoil, manifesting as a structural or implicit anger rather than an overt, explosive rage. The visible, almost forceful brushstrokes and the relentless sense of movement add to this feeling of unrest and agitation."
portrait-of-the-artist.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting shows a figure whose facial expression does not convey overt anger. There are no typical indicators such as furrowed brows, narrowed or glaring eyes, a tensed jaw, or a scowling mouth. The eyes appear more contemplative or directed, rather than expressing rage or fury. The mouth is slightly open, suggesting speech or a thoughtful pause, but not a grimace or snarl associated with anger. While the figure's hand is extended in a pointing gesture, which could be interpreted as assertive or even accusatory, it is not a clenched fist, nor does the overall posture or the subject's gaze strongly reinforce an aggressive intent. The presence of what appears to be a writing or painting tool in the hand further suggests a communicative or instructional gesture rather than one of pure aggression. The blue color of the subject's clothing tends to evoke calmness rather than intensity. While the red background can sometimes symbolize passion or intensity, it does not translate into an angry emotional state for the subject within this specific composition. The stylized, angular forms convey dynamism but do not intrinsically communicate the emotion of anger. Therefore, any perceived anger is minimal and highly interpretive, lacking concrete visual cues."
seated-woman-in-garden-1938.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting displays very few, if any, visual cues that directly convey the emotion of anger. The figure's face, though rendered in a fragmented Cubist style typical of Picasso, does not exhibit common indicators of rage such as furrowed brows, a bared or contorted mouth, flared nostrils, or glaring eyes. While the eyes are asymmetrical and disproportionate, they do not project fury or aggression. The thin, straight line of the mouth could perhaps be interpreted as sternness or a repressed emotion, but it falls far short of expressing anger. Furthermore, the figure's posture is seated and composed, lacking any tension, clenching of fists, or dynamic movement that might suggest an angry outburst or a state of agitation. The presence of red in the color palette is integrated into geometric shapes of the dress and chair, rather than being used as a dominant, expressive wash that might evoke a fiery temper. Overall, the composition and colors contribute more to a sense of intellectual deconstruction or contemplation rather than an intense negative emotion like anger."
self-portrait-with-seven-digits-autoportrait-1913.jpg,Cubism,5.7,"The painting, ""Self-Portrait with Seven Fingers"" by Marc Chagall, presents very little in the way of visual cues that would strongly suggest anger. The artist's facial expression, while stylized and angular due to the Cubist influences, lacks the traditional markers of rage such as a furrowed brow, narrowed eyes conveying menace, or a tense, downturned mouth. His gaze is intense and direct, perhaps even solemn or deeply contemplative, but it does not convey hostility or aggression. The color palette, while vibrant and varied, does not primarily use colors typically associated with anger (like overwhelming, dominant reds or dark, turbulent tones) in a way that suggests emotional turmoil within the self-portrait figure. Instead, the colors contribute to the dreamlike and symbolic atmosphere. Furthermore, the overall composition is one of introspection and artistic creation, with the artist holding a palette and brushes, rather than depicting any form of agitation or conflict. The surreal elements, like the Eiffel Tower and the floating village, evoke memory and identity, not ire. While there might be a subtle tension in the sharp lines of the face, it reads more as intense focus or profound introspection rather than any discernible anger. Therefore, the presence of anger in this artwork is minimal."
self-portrait-1913.jpg,Cubism,8.0,"The emotion of anger is largely absent from this artwork. There are no overt visual cues such as furrowed brows, a scowling mouth, flaring nostrils, or a tense, aggressive posture that would directly convey rage or irritation. The visible eye, while direct, appears more thoughtful or intense than angry, lacking any specific indicators of aggression or resentment.

However, a very subtle and abstract interpretation might detect a hint of underlying tension or psychological fragmentation, which could be distantly related to suppressed frustration or inner conflict, a precursor to anger. This stems primarily from the Cubist-inspired style, characterized by sharp, angular lines and fragmented planes that dissect the figure. These stylistic choices create a sense of discontinuity and perhaps a rigid, unyielding quality in the subject's depiction. While this fragmentation primarily serves an artistic purpose of rendering multiple perspectives, it can also evoke a feeling of unease or a mind in distress, which, if stretched, could be a very abstract symbol for psychological states that might involve anger. Nevertheless, this is a highly intellectualized interpretation of stylistic elements rather than a direct emotional read of the subject's expression or body language, which remains remarkably devoid of direct angry indicators. Therefore, the presence of anger is extremely minimal and highly indirect."
sitting-nude-1909.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting shows a seated female figure with her head bowed and her hands clasped, resting on her lap or possibly holding a book. Her posture is one of introspection, contemplation, or perhaps weariness. There are no strong visual cues that would suggest anger. Her face is obscured by her downward gaze and the angle of her head, but there's no visible scowl, furrowed brow, or tensed jawline often associated with anger. Her body language is withdrawn and inward-focused, lacking any aggressive or outwardly expressive gestures like clenched fists, rigid limbs, or an agitated stance. The color palette, while using some reds and earth tones, is generally subdued and does not employ harsh contrasts or fiery tones that might evoke a sense of rage or aggression. The lines defining her form are relatively soft and organic, rather than sharp or jagged, which could imply tension or agitation. While one could interpret a deep emotional state, it leans more towards melancholy, thoughtfulness, or quiet resignation than active anger. The overall impression is calm and meditative, completely devoid of the outward or inner turmoil typically manifested as anger."
self-portrait.jpg,Cubism,70.0,"The painting conveys a significant degree of anger primarily through its fragmented, angular forms and a somber, contrasting color palette. The central ""face"" is composed of sharp, geometric planes, particularly around what might be interpreted as the eyes and mouth. These jagged lines create a sense of tension and harshness, evocative of a stern or grim expression often associated with anger. The dark, almost hollowed-out ""eyes"" and the pointed, triangular shape for the ""mouth"" area suggest a tightened jaw or a forceful utterance, rather than a relaxed or pleasant demeanor.

The dominant use of deep blacks and brooding purples/blues contributes heavily to an overall sense of emotional weight and intensity. These dark hues are juxtaposed sharply against flashes of stark yellow and ochre, creating a visual friction that mirrors the internal conflict or agitation often inherent in anger. The fragmented nature of the figure, characteristic of Cubism, can be interpreted not just as a deconstruction of reality but also as a visual representation of a mind or emotion torn and under strain. The visible, somewhat aggressive brushstrokes also add to a feeling of raw energy and impassioned force, further reinforcing the impression of a powerful, perhaps volatile, emotional state. While abstract, the painting's visual language strongly leans towards an intense, unyielding sentiment that aligns considerably with the expression of anger."
small-things-1966.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a still life composed of various geometric and abstract objects, exhibits no visual cues that evoke anger. The color palette is largely muted, consisting of browns, greys, and desaturated greens, which are calm and contemplative rather than aggressive or volatile. There are no jarring or high-contrast colors typically associated with heightened emotional states like anger. The forms and shapes, while diverse, are predominantly geometric or smoothly curved, lacking any sharp, jagged, or chaotic lines that might suggest aggression or agitation. The composition is orderly and well-balanced, with objects thoughtfully arranged across the surface, conveying a sense of stability and stillness rather than conflict or disruption. There is no narrative content, human figures expressing anger, or depictions of conflict, violence, or destruction. The brushwork appears smooth and controlled, devoid of the agitated or impulsive strokes that could convey an artist's or a subject's rage. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of quiet contemplation, neutrality, or perhaps a gentle melancholy, entirely absent of any aggressive or furious sentiment."
soir-e-d-octobre-1946.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This abstract painting, characterized by its vibrant color blocks and grid-like composition, conveys absolutely no discernible sense of anger. The multitude of colors, while strong and varied, are harmoniously balanced, creating a sense of dynamic energy rather than aggressive clash. There are no sharp, jagged, or chaotic lines that might suggest violent emotion or internal turmoil; instead, the structure is organized and deliberate, reminiscent of stained glass or an architectural blueprint. The overall impression is one of contemplative beauty, spiritual light, or perhaps the ordered complexity of urban life, but none of these visual elements lend themselves to an interpretation of rage, frustration, or hostility. There are no agitated brushstrokes, dissonant color combinations designed to discomfort, or symbolic forms that could be interpreted as aggressive or confrontational. The painting's essence is one of structured vitality and internal luminescence, entirely devoid of any visual cues associated with anger."
spanish-dancers.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting conveys an almost complete absence of anger. The faces of both women are highly stylized and impassive; there are no furrowed brows, narrowed eyes, or tense mouth formations that would indicate rage, frustration, or hostility. Their expressions appear serene, formal, or perhaps melancholic, rather than angry. The body language also offers no cues of anger; the woman on the left extends her hand in a gesture that seems open or presentational, while the woman on the right has her arms crossed, a pose that suggests composure, introspection, or guardedness, but not aggression or defiance in this context. There are no dynamic or violent brushstrokes, nor any clashing or aggressive color choices (such as dominant reds or sharp contrasts) that might implicitly convey an angry emotional state. The overall composition is static and formal, focusing on the traditional attire and abstracted forms, rather than depicting any narrative conflict or tension that would evoke anger. The angularity of the figures and background is a stylistic choice, characteristic of the art movement, and does not inherently translate to emotional aggression or fury."
shacks-1964.jpg,Cubism,18.0,"The painting does not primarily evoke a strong sense of anger or rage. The predominant cool color palette (blues, purples, greys) tends to mute any intense emotional outbursts. There is no chaotic or frenetic brushwork that might suggest uncontrolled fury.

However, a very subtle undercurrent of tension and potential frustration can be perceived, preventing a score of 0. This comes primarily from the strong, dark, angular lines that dissect and fragment the composition. These lines are assertive, almost slashing, creating a sense of breaking apart or deconstruction. The recurring ""X"" shapes, particularly in the upper half of the painting, can be interpreted as symbols of negation, conflict, or cancellation, which might subtly resonate with feelings of defiance or opposition – elements often associated with, or precursors to, anger. The fragmented nature of the forms, suggesting a dismantled or disarranged reality, could also evoke a mild sense of discomfort or disquiet. Despite these elements, the overall impression is more one of structured abstraction and intellectual dissection than raw, visceral anger. The controlled nature of the lines and the lack of hot, aggressive colors keep any potential for anger very low and subdued."
still-life-1.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The primary reasons for this complete absence of the emotion lie in the deliberate choices of subject matter, color palette, composition, and artistic style. Firstly, the subject is a classic still life, featuring everyday objects such as a bowl of fruit, various vases, and detached foliage. This genre is inherently devoid of narrative tension, conflict, or any elements that typically provoke anger, unlike historical or dramatic paintings. Secondly, the color palette is overwhelmingly muted, soft, and cool, dominated by gentle greys, whites, light blues, and earthy browns, with subtle touches of muted red and pale yellow in the fruit. There is a complete absence of the aggressive, high-chroma reds, sharp blacks, or jarring contrasts often associated with the expression of anger. The colors blend harmoniously, creating a sense of calm rather than agitation. Thirdly, the composition is balanced and orderly, with objects arranged deliberately and peacefully on a flat surface. There are no sharp, discordant angles, no chaotic arrangements, nor any dynamic lines that might suggest aggression or upheaval. The forms are gentle and rounded. Lastly, the overall artistic approach, characterized by soft edges, diffused lighting, and a somewhat ethereal quality, creates a serene and contemplative atmosphere. There is no harsh brushwork, jagged lines, or distorted forms that might convey emotional turbulence or frustration. Every visual element points away from any feeling of anger, establishing a mood of quiet contemplation and visual harmony instead."
still-life-1920.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes no discernible sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter, a domestic still life featuring common food items like a loaf of bread or cake, oranges, and biscuits, is inherently peaceful and devoid of any confrontational or disturbing elements. The composition is highly structured and orderly, with objects neatly arranged on a table, conveying a sense of stability and calm rather than agitation or disruption. There are no dynamic or aggressive lines; instead, the forms are solid, volumetric, and contained. The color palette is composed of subdued, earthy tones—browns, muted oranges, grays, and whites—which are far from the vibrant, clashing, or harsh hues often associated with expressions of anger or intensity. There is an absence of sharp contrasts or discordant color relationships that might provoke an emotional jolt. The lighting is soft and even, casting gentle shadows that contribute to the tranquil atmosphere, rather than creating dramatic tension or unease. Furthermore, the brushwork appears smooth and controlled, lacking any frenzied or agitated strokes that could convey a sense of inner turmoil or outward aggression. There is no narrative element within the still life that suggests conflict, frustration, or any form of hostility. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, domesticity, and stillness, leaving absolutely no visual or emotional pathway to interpret or experience anger within this artwork."
stables-1913.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. While the artwork features a vibrant and strong color palette, including significant reds which can sometimes be associated with intensity or passion, these colors are used in a dynamic and energetic manner rather than conveying fury or aggression. The fragmented forms and Cubist-like abstraction create a sense of movement and visual tension, but this tension appears to be artistic and compositional, focusing on dynamism and deconstruction of form rather than emotional agitation or conflict. The subject matter, horses in motion, suggests power and vitality, but their depiction is not one of rage, struggle, or violent confrontation. There are no harsh, jarring elements that evoke a sense of distress or fury. The overall impression is one of lively movement and bold color exploration, which largely neutralizes any potential for anger that might otherwise be inferred from the use of strong hues. The painting feels energetic and active, but not hostile or aggressive."
still-life-scales-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a still life featuring a scale, bread rolls, and draped fabric, evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter itself—common household objects related to sustenance and measurement—is inherently neutral and peaceful, rather than provoking strong negative emotions. There are no elements within the composition that suggest conflict, tension, or distress; the arrangement of items is orderly and balanced, typical of the still-life genre. Furthermore, the color palette, predominantly composed of deep blues, warm yellows, and muted grays, does not include any sharp, aggressive, or fiery hues typically associated with anger. The lighting is soft and natural, contributing to a calm atmosphere rather than one of agitation or fury. The brushwork, while visible and expressive, lacks any frenetic energy or violent strokes that might convey an angry mood. Instead, the overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, domesticity, or perhaps a moment of serene observation, utterly devoid of any emotional resonance with anger."
still-life-crystal-1916.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting, a monochromatic drawing characterized by strong, angular lines and a fragmented, Cubist-like composition, offers very little to suggest the emotion of anger. The subject matter appears to be a still life, with discernible bottles, glasses, and possibly other items arranged on a surface. Still life compositions are inherently neutral in terms of direct emotional conveyance, and there are no elements within this particular arrangement that imply violence, destruction, or aggressive interaction between the objects. The lines, while bold and decisive, seem to serve the purpose of defining form and space within an analytical, abstract style rather than conveying raw emotional intensity or agitation. There are no frantic scribbles, sharp, explosive strokes, or chaotic arrangements that would typically be associated with an expression of rage or hostility. The monochromatic palette further mutes any potential for intense emotional expression that might be amplified by aggressive color choices. The overall feeling evoked is one of formal study and intellectual engagement with perception, rather than emotional turmoil. A very minimal score is given only to account for the possibility that some viewers might find the fragmentation or sharp angles marginally unsettling, which is a very distant and indirect association with anger, not a direct or intended expression of it."
still-life-with-ephemeris-1914.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, a work of Analytic Cubism by Louis Marcoussis, offers very little to evoke or represent the emotion of anger. The color palette is predominantly muted, consisting of blacks, whites, grays, browns, and a cool blue, which are colors that typically do not carry strong angry connotations. There are no vibrant, aggressive reds or clashing, dissonant color combinations that might suggest rage or frustration. The composition, while fragmented and complex, is structured and analytical rather than chaotic or violently deconstructed. The geometric forms, straight lines, and gentle curves do not convey a sense of agitation, aggression, or sharp conflict. There are no distorted figures or expressive gestures that could be interpreted as angry. The subject matter appears to be a still life, including a calendar date (1914 March 2) and a book (""EAU DANS""), which are neutral objects that inherently do not provoke or express anger. The overall impression is one of intellectual deconstruction and multiple perspectives, a characteristic of the Cubist movement, rather than an emotional outpouring. While the fragmentation might be seen by some as a disruption, it is a formal artistic choice, not an expression of emotional turmoil or anger. The painting lacks any visual cues such as explosive energy, sharp, jagged forms pointing outward aggressively, or a sense of violent movement or destruction that would align with feelings of anger. The atmosphere is more contemplative and intellectual than emotionally charged or hostile."
still-life-with-lemons-1907.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting. While the fractured forms and strong, sometimes dark, outlines could be interpreted as creating a certain intensity or tension characteristic of early Cubism, this tension is primarily intellectual and structural, rather than emotionally aggressive or furious. The color palette, which includes deep blues, earthy greens, and contrasting yellows and oranges, does not specifically convey rage; the reds and oranges are more muted and serve as an accent or background element rather than a dominant, fiery expression of anger. The brushwork, though visible and textural, is not frenetic or violent. There is no depiction of conflict, struggle, or aggressive energy in the subject matter or its treatment. The overall impression is one of analytical deconstruction and formal exploration, not an outburst or simmering resentment. Any hint of anger is purely incidental to the stylistic choices of the artist, rather than a deliberate emotional focus."
still-life-on-the-dresser-1955.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting, a Cubist still life, exhibits virtually no elements that would evoke or express the emotion of anger. The subject matter itself—a collection of everyday objects including flowers, fruit, and vessels—is inherently placid and does not carry any narrative or symbolic weight typically associated with aggression or conflict. While Cubism involves the fragmentation and reassembly of forms, this process in the painting feels analytical and intellectual, rather than emotionally violent or wrathful. The lines, though geometric, are not sharp or jagged in a manner that suggests fury or hostile energy. The color palette, dominated by warm earth tones (browns, yellows, ochres) with accents of red, blue, and white, is harmonious and lacks the harsh, clashing, or fiery hues often used to convey intense rage. There are no agitated brushstrokes, chaotic compositions, or distorted figures that might communicate an angry state. The overall impression is one of contemplative deconstruction and formal exploration, a quiet study of objects in space, utterly devoid of any discernible sense of hostility, resentment, or rage. Any minor deviation from zero might stem from the abstract nature of Cubism, which can sometimes evoke a subtle intellectual tension rather than an emotional one, but this is far removed from true anger."
still-life-with-water-jug-towel-and-jars-1929.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting, a still life composition, exhibits absolutely no visual cues or thematic elements that would evoke or represent anger. The depicted objects – a pitcher, various vessels, and draped fabric – are inanimate and arranged in a static, balanced composition. The color palette consists of cool blues, greens, and earthy browns and ochres, which are calming or neutral, rather than aggressive or intense. There are no harsh, jarring contrasts, fiery hues, or violent brushstrokes that might suggest a sense of fury or agitation. The forms, while somewhat abstracted with distinct planes, are not sharp, broken, or chaotic in a way that would imply discord or aggression. The lighting creates distinct shadows but does not appear harsh or confrontational. The overall mood conveyed by the artwork is one of quiet contemplation, order, and perhaps a subtle solemnity, entirely devoid of any trace of anger or resentment."
self-portrait-with-yellow-hat-1965-janos-kmetty-oil-painting-1.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting conveys very little, if any, overt anger. The subject's expression, while intense and somewhat furrowed, points more towards deep contemplation, weariness, or a sense of profound mental burden rather than active rage or fury. His hand placed to his forehead is a classic gesture of thought, stress, or a headache, which could stem from frustration, but does not directly signify anger. There are no typical signs of anger such as a bared teeth snarl, widely flared nostrils, intensely glaring eyes directed outwards, or a clenched fist. The overall body language appears inward-focused and contemplative rather than outwardly aggressive or agitated. The muted color palette further reinforces a somber or pensive mood, rather than the fiery tones often associated with anger. While there might be a subtle underlying tension or frustration indicated by the brow and the angularity of the facial features, it is minimal and secondary to the dominant impression of a troubled or burdened mind."
still-life.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The subject matter is a still life, typically a calm and contemplative genre, featuring potted plants, flowers in a vase, and fruit, none of which inherently carry connotations of anger or aggression. The color palette, dominated by various shades of green, yellow, orange, white, and cool blues and grays, is vibrant yet harmonious. While certain warm colors like orange can sometimes be associated with strong emotions, here they are used in a naturalistic context for the fruit and a flower, appearing warm and inviting rather than fiery or confrontational.

The Cubist style, characterized by geometric fragmentation and multiple perspectives, is an intellectual approach to deconstructing and reconstructing form. While the fractured planes might prevent a sense of easy tranquility, they do not convey agitation, rage, or conflict. The lines are structured and deliberate, not chaotic, aggressive, or violent. There are no distorted figures, scenes of struggle, or harsh, clashing visual elements that would typically signify anger. The overall impression is one of formal exploration and artistic analysis rather than emotional turmoil. The brushwork appears controlled and systematic, further contributing to a sense of order rather than emotional outburst. Any score above zero is merely to acknowledge the slightest, almost imperceptible tension that *might* arise from the analytical fragmentation for a viewer accustomed to purely naturalistic representation, but this is a very remote connection to anger."
stll-life-with-a-red-vase-1939.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This still life painting elicits no discernible emotion of anger. The subject matter, a collection of domestic objects including a pitcher, grapes, and various fruits arranged in a bowl, inherently suggests a sense of calm and everyday tranquility rather than discord or fury. The color palette, composed predominantly of muted and earthy tones—browns, grays, whites, and a warm, reddish-orange for the pitcher—lacks the vibrant, clashing, or aggressive hues often associated with anger. There are no sharp, jagged lines, chaotic compositions, or violent brushstrokes that could convey agitation or aggression. Instead, the forms are rendered with a deliberate, somewhat flattened simplification and clear, bold outlines, contributing to a sense of order and quiet contemplation. The overall arrangement is balanced and harmonious, devoid of any tension or conflict. There are no human or animal figures whose expressions or actions might denote anger, nor are there any symbolic elements traditionally linked to wrath or fury. The painting presents a static, aesthetically arranged scene, inviting observation rather than provoking any strong emotional response of anger."
sudak-the-valley-1917.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no visual elements within this painting that evoke or suggest anger. The color palette, while featuring earthy reds and oranges for the prominent mountain, combines these with serene blues and various shades of green, creating a natural and rather harmonious landscape. There are no harsh, clashing, or aggressive color combinations. The brushstrokes, though visible and textural, are not chaotic, frantic, or violent; instead, they convey a sense of a painterly and deliberate approach. The subject matter itself—a landscape featuring a majestic mountain, lush trees, and a small, unassuming house—is inherently peaceful and stable, devoid of any figures, conflict, struggle, or destructive forces. The composition feels balanced and grounded, rather than turbulent or unsettling. The overall impression is one of natural grandeur and tranquility, entirely absent of any emotional charge that would be associated with anger or rage."
still-life-red-and-yellow.jpg,Cubism,35.0,"The emotion of anger, while subtly suggested, is not a dominant or overtly expressed feeling in this painting. The most significant element contributing to a sense of anger is the extensive and prominent use of a deep, rich red. Red is a color universally associated with intense emotions, including passion, aggression, and anger. Its sheer volume in the composition creates a powerful, almost confrontational presence that can evoke a primal sense of strong, perhaps agitated, feeling.

Furthermore, the composition's fragmented nature, with stark, blocky forms and strong contrasts between areas of black, white, and yellow, introduces a degree of visual tension and disquiet. The angular cuts and the seemingly disjointed placement of elements, particularly the large white head-like shape against the dark background, can imply a sense of internal conflict or unease, which might be an underlying current that could lead to anger. The heavy, unrefined texture of the paint, visible in the brushstrokes, lends a certain rawness that could be interpreted as mirroring the raw, untamed nature of anger.

However, the painting refrains from explicitly depicting anger. There are no dynamic, chaotic brushstrokes that would convey explosive rage. The forms, while bold, are largely static and defined, lacking the violent motion or distortion often associated with furious emotion. The white, featureless head remains placid and stoic, offering no direct visual cues of an angry countenance. The overall impression is more one of contained intensity or abstract contemplation of strong emotions, rather than an active outpouring of aggression or fury. The tension present feels more formal and structural than emotionally volatile. Therefore, while hints of intensity and potential discord exist due to color and composition, they do not fully coalesce into a palpable sense of anger."
taureau-x-1955.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The painting, an abstract work featuring stylized forms and a vibrant color palette, presents very little that directly or indirectly evokes anger. There are no sharp, aggressive lines or jagged shapes that might convey a sense of agitation or hostility. The composition appears balanced and somewhat whimsical, rather than chaotic or confrontational. While red is present in the artwork, particularly in the flowing, organic shape on the right side and the rounded forms in the lower half, its application does not feel aggressive or violent. Instead, it contributes to the overall vibrancy and organic flow of the piece. There are no discernible figures expressing angry emotions, nor are there any elements that suggest conflict, tension, or a sense of injustice that might provoke an angry response from the viewer. The overall mood leans more towards the contemplative, abstract, or perhaps even playful, lacking the intensity or visual cues typically associated with anger. The very low score reflects the absence of these elements."
soccer-field-1934.jpg,Cubism,20.0,"The depiction of anger in this painting is extremely subtle and largely open to interpretation, rather than overtly expressed. The most compelling, albeit weak, indicator lies in the dynamic pose of the dark, silhouetted figure situated towards the upper-middle right. This figure appears to be in the act of striking downwards or wielding an implement overhead, a gesture that could, in certain contexts, imply forceful action potentially driven by frustration or aggression.

However, several factors significantly diminish the perception of anger. Firstly, the figures are highly stylized and abstract, lacking any discernible facial expressions or detailed bodily cues that would convey rage or wrath. The other smaller figures on the left appear to be floating or falling, their forms not suggesting any aggressive intent. Secondly, the overall color palette is muted, dominated by somber greys, browns, and off-whites. There is an absence of vibrant or clashing hues, such as fiery reds, that are often associated with intense emotional states like anger. Lastly, the composition does not present a clear conflict, confrontation, or chaotic energy that would typically signify an angry narrative. The large, pale figure on the right, for example, maintains a stoic, almost classical stance, completely devoid of any aggressive tension. Thus, while a singular gesture might fleetingly hint at forceful action, the painting does not actively resonate with or overtly express anger, keeping its presence minimal and ambiguous."
t13861-10.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent from this painting. The artwork is characterized by its precise geometric forms, cool color palette dominated by blues and greys, and an overall sense of order and structural design. Anger is typically conveyed through visual elements such as warm, intense colors (like dominant reds or oranges), chaotic or aggressive brushstrokes, distorted forms, or imagery depicting conflict, frustration, or hostility. None of these elements are present here. The lines are straight and measured, creating a complex yet controlled architectural vision. While there are very subtle touches of red in the composition, they appear as structural accents rather than expressions of fiery emotion. The overall impression is one of calm, analytical observation, or perhaps a meditative quality, far removed from the agitated or hostile feelings associated with anger. Any perceived sliver of anger would be an extreme and highly subjective projection by a viewer, possibly stemming from an interpretation of rigidity or the impersonal nature of the structure, but this is not an emotion directly communicated by the painting itself."
the-blue-cloth-1925.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, a Cubist still life by Juan Gris, offers very little to evoke a sense of anger. The color palette, consisting primarily of muted blues, browns, creams, and a reddish-purple background, is harmonious and subdued rather than aggressive or confrontational. There are no jarring or sharp contrasts that might indicate tension or rage. The forms, while deconstructed and reassembled in a Cubist manner, maintain a sense of order and balance within the circular composition. There are no violent or chaotic lines, and the objects—a basket, a musical instrument (likely a guitar), a vase, and what appears to be sheet music and grapes—are typical subjects for still life, generally associated with domesticity, contemplation, or artistic expression, not fury. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of quiet introspection, intellectual engagement, and artistic exploration, rather than any strong, overt emotional display of anger. The calmness and intellectual nature of the Cubist analysis outweigh any potential for agitation. A minimal score is given to account for the possibility that some viewers might perceive a very subtle, underlying tension in the intellectual deconstruction of reality, which could be distantly linked to a suppressed unease, but this is a very indirect and weak association with anger."
taureau-ix-1954.jpg,Cubism,8.0,"The painting does not strongly evoke anger. There are no explicit visual cues such as angry facial expressions, aggressive poses, or violent brushstrokes typically associated with rage. The fragmented and abstract nature of the artwork, while potentially suggesting internal complexity or disarray, does not inherently convey a sense of hostility or fury. The figure, if interpreted as such, displays no clear signs of anger; its ""face"" is more ambiguous or contemplative.

However, a very slight degree of tension or intensity, which could subtly relate to anger, might be inferred from a few elements. The prominent use of vibrant red in certain areas (such as the crescent shape in the upper right and the rounded forms in the lower right) can be associated with strong emotions, including passion or even frustration. While these reds are integrated into a harmonious, complex palette and don't create a jarring or aggressive visual discord, their presence might suggest an underlying emotional charge. Additionally, the angularity and deconstructed forms, characteristic of the cubist style, could be interpreted by some as conveying a sense of psychological fragmentation or unease, which *could* be a precursor to or associated with feelings of irritation or anger. Nevertheless, these are very subtle interpretations, and the overall impression is one of visual dynamism and intellectual exploration rather than overt emotional aggression."
the-artists-1916.jpg,Cubism,73.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of intense, highly charged emotion, which aligns significantly with the feeling of anger. This is primarily achieved through the striking and often clashing use of color: the dominance of fiery reds, oranges, and vibrant yellows creates an immediate impression of heat, passion, and energetic force, all of which can be precursors or components of anger. These warm, assertive colors are frequently juxtaposed with deep blues and greens, creating sharp visual contrasts that contribute to a feeling of tension and dynamic conflict rather than harmony or tranquility.

Furthermore, the forms within the abstract composition contribute to this perception. There are jagged, spiky elements, particularly on the left side of the painting, which evoke sharpness, aggression, or an explosive outburst. While other forms are swirling and curvilinear, their energetic and often fragmented nature suggests a restless, turbulent movement rather than a smooth, calm flow. The overall composition lacks soft edges or serene spaces; instead, it is characterized by overlapping, colliding shapes and forceful brushstrokes, implying an agitated or confrontational state. The raw, unblended quality of the crayon or pastel medium itself adds to this visceral, almost raw emotional output, mirroring the unbridled nature of anger. The intensity is palpable, suggesting a forceful expression of strong, possibly agitated or defiant, emotion."
the-bird-seller-1976.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The emotion of anger is largely absent in this painting. There are no discernible visual cues that directly express or evoke strong anger from within the artwork itself. The human figure's face is obscured and does not display any signs of rage or frustration. The birds, while some are depicted in cages, do not appear to be violently thrashing or displaying aggressive behavior; their forms are stylized and more suggestive of their state of being rather than an emotional outburst. The color palette, though vibrant and featuring reds, oranges, and blues, does not utilize these colors in a manner that conveys fury or aggression. Instead, the colors contribute to a dynamic and complex visual texture. The fragmented, geometric style, characteristic of Cubism, creates a sense of movement and multiple perspectives but does not inherently translate to an angry or violent atmosphere. While the theme of capturing and caging birds *might* evoke a sense of indignation or sorrow in a viewer sympathetic to animal rights, the painting does not present this act with an angry tone or illustrate any conflict stemming from anger within the scene. The overall feeling is more observational or a depiction of a particular livelihood, rather than an expression of rage or resentment. The low score reflects the lack of any significant visual elements directly conveying anger, either from the subjects or the artistic execution."
the-appointment-of-the-four-forms-from-the-portfolio-life-forms.jpg,Cubism,72.0,"The visual elements within this abstract composition powerfully evoke a sense of anger and intense agitation. The most striking contributor is the dense, chaotic, and frenetic cross-hatching that forms the outer border of the image. This agitated texture creates an overwhelming feeling of turbulence, unrestrained energy, and raw emotional intensity, akin to a seething rage or a storm of frustration. The lines are not merely decorative; they feel like an active, almost violent manifestation of inner turmoil.

Furthermore, the stark black and white contrast, particularly the deep, ominous black voids and sharp geometric elements within the central composition, contribute to this feeling. These dark areas can be interpreted as oppressive forces or symbols of negativity, while the sharp, angular line cutting through softer, more organic shapes suggests conflict, disruption, or aggression. This interplay between the smooth, rounded forms and the sharp, penetrating lines creates a strong sense of tension and discord.

The overall composition gives the impression of central forms being confined or struggling within this turbulent, dark embrace. This sense of being enveloped by a chaotic, aggressive force can amplify feelings of anger, resentment, or a desperate struggle against external pressures. The abstract nature allows for a visceral, rather than literal, emotional response, and the visual language of sharp edges, deep shadows, and frenetic lines speaks strongly to a powerful and sustained emotional state of anger."
the-breakfast-1921.jpg,Cubism,3.0,"The painting, ""Three Women (Le Grand Déjeuner)"" by Fernand Léger, exhibits almost no discernible elements that would evoke or depict anger. The figures, rendered in Léger's signature ""tubist"" style, are monumental and geometric, their faces simplified and mask-like, completely devoid of any specific emotional expression such as furrowed brows, tense mouths, or agitated eyes that would signify anger. Their poses are either relaxed (reclining, seated) or engaged in calm, everyday actions like drinking tea, showing no signs of aggression, confrontation, or physical tension associated with anger. The overall composition is highly ordered and static, with strong lines and clear segmentation of space, which contributes to a sense of calm and stability rather than unrest or conflict. The color palette, predominantly whites, grays, and blacks with accents of red and yellow, is balanced and does not feature jarring or violent contrasts that might suggest an angry mood. The atmosphere is one of detached observation and monumental tranquility, far removed from any sense of rage, frustration, or hostility. The very impersonal and mechanistic representation of the figures further reduces the capacity for strong human emotions like anger to be conveyed."
the-bird-cage.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no discernible qualities that would evoke anger. The bold, fragmented forms and vibrant color palette, characteristic of Cubism, create a sense of visual complexity and dynamism rather than hostility or rage. While the sharp angles and dense composition might contribute to a feeling of intensity or perhaps even a slight sense of visual ""busyness,"" this is a stylistic choice and does not translate into an emotion of anger. There are no aggressive figures, confrontational gestures, or narrative elements that suggest conflict or resentment. The colors, though strong, are balanced and contribute to a lively, almost playful energy, rather than conveying a sense of destructive fury or overwhelming negativity often associated with anger. The subject matter itself, ""The Three Musicians,"" typically evokes themes of harmony, performance, and collaboration, further distancing the work from any angry sentiment. Any minimal score is purely to acknowledge that the intense visual information might be slightly agitating for some viewers, but this is far from a direct or intended evocation of anger."
the-cloud-1921.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no visual cues or thematic elements that would evoke anger. The color palette, dominated by warm browns, golds, and cool blues, is generally subdued and harmonious, lacking the sharp contrasts, fiery reds, or aggressive tones often associated with this emotion. The subject matter – a still life depicting a guitar, a newspaper, and a table in an interior setting – consists of mundane, inanimate objects that inherently carry no emotional charge of anger. There are no figures expressing rage, no violent or destructive actions depicted, and no disturbing or unsettling imagery that might incite such a feeling.

While the Cubist style involves fragmentation and multiple perspectives, in this particular work by Juan Gris, the composition maintains a sense of order and balance. The geometric forms are carefully arranged, and the lines are clean, creating an intellectual rather than an overtly emotional experience. There is no aggressive brushwork, chaotic dynamism, or strong visual tension that would translate into a feeling of anger. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, domesticity, and artistic exploration of form and space, entirely devoid of any sense of fury, irritation, or hostility. A very minimal score is given to acknowledge the subjective nature of emotional response to art, but effectively, the painting presents no discernible pathways to the feeling of anger."
the-feast-of-the-tabernacles-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting ""The Feast of the Tabernacles (1916)"" by Marc Chagall depicts a scene from the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, a time typically associated with joy, community, and spiritual reflection. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest anger or hostility. The figures, though stylized, exhibit no expressions of rage, frustration, or aggression. The man on the left holds the lulav and etrog, symbolic of the festival, in a solemn or contemplative manner, not an angry one. The individuals gathered at the table within the Sukkah appear engaged in a peaceful, perhaps ritualistic, activity; their postures and implied interactions lack any tension or conflict. Even the woman peeking from the right, with her exaggerated smile, conveys a lively participation rather than ill will. The color palette, while vibrant, is not used in a way that creates a sense of disturbance or aggression. The overall atmosphere is one of communal observance and quiet celebration. There are no visual cues such as harsh lines, violent gestures, or tumultuous compositions that would elicit a feeling of anger. Any score above zero is merely to acknowledge the abstract possibility that a viewer *could* project such an emotion onto the scene, rather than finding it inherently present within Chagall's depiction."
the-circus-1918.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting, characteristic of Cubist and Futurist movements, presents a fragmented and dynamic composition, but very little suggests the emotion of anger. There are no visual cues of aggression, violence, or explicit conflict. While the forms are broken down and reassembled, creating a sense of rapid movement and sensory overload, this fragmentation does not translate into fury or rage. The figures, such as the simplified man and dog, lack any discernible angry expressions or postures. The color palette, though featuring strong contrasts (e.g., vibrant blues, reds, yellows against blacks and whites), feels more energetic and exploratory than harsh or enraged. The sharp angles and overlapping planes are stylistic choices reflecting modernity and motion, rather than conveying a sense of destructive anger or aggressive confrontation. The overall impression is one of intellectual deconstruction and the chaotic vibrancy of modern life, rather than an outpouring of emotional displeasure or wrath. Any perceived 'unease' from the disjointed forms is more akin to disorientation than anger."
the-fiddler-1914.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, ""The Violinist,"" by Marc Chagall, primarily evokes a sense of dreamlike narrative, folk music, and fantastical elements rather than strong negative emotions like anger. There are very few visual cues that directly suggest or provoke anger. The violinist's face is rendered in an unnatural green, which is characteristic of Chagall's symbolic color use, but it does not convey a furious or enraged expression; his focus appears to be entirely on his instrument. The eyes are wide, but more indicative of absorption or a surreal state than anger. Similarly, the younger man beside him has an ambiguous expression, perhaps one of awe or curiosity, but certainly not anger. The distant figures in the background are too small to discern any specific emotion. While the use of vivid red on the violinist's coat and the house roof can be an intense color, in this context, it appears to contribute to the overall vibrancy and emotional warmth of the scene rather than signifying rage or aggression. The overall atmosphere is more whimsical, nostalgic, or melancholic, typical of Chagall's work, rather than overtly hostile or angry. Any perceived anger would be purely subjective and not directly supported by the depicted elements. A very low score is given due to the complete lack of facial expressions, body language, or thematic elements that typically communicate anger."
the-fourteenth-of-july-1914.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent in this painting. The stylized, geometric representations of the two figures offer no discernible facial expressions or body language that would convey agitation, frustration, or aggression. Their poses are static and neutral; one figure stands with hands on hips, while the other is seated, neither posture suggesting any internal conflict or outward hostility. The color palette, predominantly composed of soft blues, yellows, pinks, and muted greens, lacks the harsh, intense, or clashing tones typically associated with anger. There are no sharp, violent lines, turbulent brushstrokes, or chaotic compositional elements that might hint at a sense of rage or disquiet. The overall fragmented yet orderly arrangement of shapes and colors creates a rather contemplative or perhaps serene atmosphere, which stands in stark contrast to any notion of anger. The painting offers no visual cues to elicit or reflect this particular emotion."
the-jug-on-the-table.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a Cubist still life, offers no discernible elements that evoke anger. The subject matter – what appears to be a coffee pot, cup, and saucer, along with a newspaper fragment and a checkered pattern – is entirely mundane and devoid of any narrative or implied action that could incite or reflect anger. The colors are predominantly muted and earthy (greys, browns, beige, and some muted green), which do not carry the intensity or urgency often associated with angry emotions (e.g., vibrant reds or chaotic dark tones). The fragmented, geometric forms characteristic of Cubism, while intellectually challenging or disorienting to some, are not aggressive or confrontational in their presentation; rather, they are analytical and deconstructive. There are no sharp, violent lines, chaotic brushstrokes, or distorted figures that might convey agitation or fury. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet contemplation or intellectual exploration, entirely devoid of emotional turmoil, conflict, or aggression."
the-javelin-thrower.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The artwork, a poster for the 1924 Olympic Games, primarily conveys themes of athleticism, strength, and the spirit of competition. The figures, rendered in a stylized, almost robotic or monumental Art Deco manner, exhibit focused determination rather than any overt emotion. The central javelin thrower, for instance, has a neutral, almost impassive face, characteristic of the era's artistic conventions that often prioritized form and dynamism over detailed emotional expression. Similarly, the smaller figures engaged in other sports (basketball, boxing, fencing) are depicted in active poses, but their actions are within the bounds of sporting competition, not expressions of rage or hostility. There are no clenched fists signifying fury, no scowling visages, no aggressive stances beyond what is necessary for the depicted sport itself. The color palette, consisting of earthy browns, grays, whites, and muted blues and reds, does not evoke the intensity or volatility often associated with anger. The overall composition is dynamic and celebratory of the human form in motion, aligning with the positive ideals of the Olympic Games. The very slight, almost negligible score of 0.5 acknowledges the inherent competitive nature of sports, where a fleeting micro-expression of frustration or fierce concentration *could* be interpreted by some as a hint of an emotion related to anger, but there is absolutely no explicit visual evidence to support a stronger attribution of this emotion. It is overwhelmingly absent from the visual narrative and aesthetic."
the-fiance-1944.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting exhibits very minimal to no visual cues typically associated with the emotion of anger. There are no angry or agitated facial expressions; the figures' faces, though stylized and angular, appear more solemn, enigmatic, or contemplative rather than enraged or hostile. Their eyes are wide but lack the piercing gaze or furrowed brows indicative of anger. Similarly, there is no aggressive body language, such as clenched fists, tensed postures, or gestures of confrontation or violence. The figures appear to be standing or interacting calmly, one holding a musical instrument (a guitar), and the other possibly another object, suggesting a tranquil or shared moment rather than conflict.

The color palette, while featuring some darker blues and purples in the background, also incorporates greens, yellows, and earthy tones, none of which are used in a manner that evokes rage or intense fury. There is an absence of sharp, clashing reds or chaotic brushstrokes that might convey an emotional outburst. The overall composition is structured, albeit abstract, and lacks the chaotic or discordant elements that might arise from an angry scene. The distortion and angularity are characteristic of the Cubist-inspired style and serve the aesthetic representation of forms rather than conveying a specific strong emotion like anger. Any perceived tension would be more aligned with artistic stylization or introspection rather than overt rage."
the-creation-of-the-prehistoric-world-state-1923.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The depiction of this stylized creature conveys a very minimal sense of anger. There is no dynamic pose or action that suggests aggression or rage; the creature is depicted in a static, grounded position, appearing more poised or watchful than enraged. The single, prominent eye, while striking, is wide and open, lacking the narrowed gaze or furrowed brow typically associated with an angry expression. The mouth-like feature below the eye is highly stylized with horizontal white lines, resembling a decorative pattern more than a snarling or teeth-baring grimace. While the creature possesses horn-like protrusions on its head and a somewhat imposing presence due to its unique form and deep colors (maroon and orange), these elements suggest a creature of power or mystical significance rather than one actively experiencing or expressing anger. The colors, although warm and deep, are used decoratively and do not portray the flushed, intense reds often associated with fury. The intricate patterns across its body and tail contribute to an impression of symbolic or tribal art, focusing more on aesthetic and cultural meaning than the raw display of a specific emotion like anger. Therefore, the visual cues for anger are virtually absent, leading to a very low rating."
the-level-crossing-1912.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, with its fragmented, geometric forms and a palette dominated by greens, ochres, and off-whites, interspersed with deliberate blocks of red and touches of purple, does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. There is an analytical, structured quality to the composition, characteristic of Cubism, which tends to prioritize intellectual engagement over raw emotional outpouring. The lines, while delineating planes and shapes, are not sharp, jagged, or frenetic in a way that suggests aggression or violent energy. The color choices, including the prominent reds, are used as compositional elements, providing visual anchors or contrasts, rather than conveying heat, rage, or conflict. The reds are bold and assertive, but not searing or clashing in a manner that would induce anger. There is no sense of chaotic struggle, explosive energy, or confrontational force within the brushwork or the arrangement of forms. The overall impression is one of visual dissection and reconstruction, which maintains a certain detachment that mitigates any strong emotional charge of anger."
the-lamp-1919.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The painting evokes a very minimal sense of anger, if any, primarily due to the overall lack of dynamic tension, aggressive imagery, or clear narrative elements that would typically incite such a powerful emotion. The figure, resembling a mannequin or automaton, displays no discernible facial expression or body language indicative of anger, frustration, or rage. Its pose is static and somewhat detached as it reaches for the lamp, conveying more a sense of quiet observation or mundane action rather than any emotional outburst. There are no elements of conflict, injustice, or violent energy in the composition. The color palette, dominated by dark greens, blues, and grays, with stark white and a patch of red, is somber and cool, lacking the fiery intensity often associated with anger. While the artificiality of the figure might evoke a subtle sense of unease or dehumanization in some viewers, these feelings are far removed from direct anger. The scene is too controlled and still to suggest any emotional agitation. Any faint trace of anger might stem from a very abstract interpretation of existential detachment or the coldness of the depicted world, potentially leading to a slight feeling of frustration with its starkness, but this is a very indirect and weak connection."
the-new-eve-1924.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that would evoke a sense of anger. The figures are highly stylized and geometric, completely lacking the facial expressions or body language necessary to convey rage, frustration, or hostility. Their cylindrical heads and simplified forms offer no visual cues for emotional states, and their poses are static and formal rather than dynamic or aggressive. The overall composition is orderly and structured, devoid of the chaos, tension, or conflict often associated with anger. There is no narrative depicted that suggests injustice, violence, or any situation that would provoke an angry response. The color palette, while including some muted earthy tones and darker contrasts, does not employ colors or sharp contrasts in a way that typically signifies intense negative emotions like anger. The dominant impression is one of cool detachment and structural exploration, leaving no room for the emotion of anger to manifest."
the-night-responds-to-my-complaints-1933.jpg,Cubism,3.5,"The painting evokes very little, if any, sense of anger. The predominant mood is one of quiet contemplation, melancholic introspection, or dreamlike mystery, none of which align with feelings of fury, frustration, or aggression. The color palette, dominated by muted browns, beiges, and dusky purples, lacks the vibrant, intense hues (such as reds or deep, stark blacks) often associated with expressions of anger. Furthermore, the figures, though distorted and elongated in a manner typical of the Cubist or Surrealist influence, do not display overt signs of rage, confrontational postures, or violent actions. Their forms appear more in a state of suspended motion, perhaps dancing or simply existing within a complex mental landscape, rather than engaged in any angry outburst. The architectural elements and fragmented forms contribute to a sense of intellectual complexity or a fractured reality, which might be unsettling, but not intrinsically rage-inducing. There is an absence of sharp, jagged lines that might suggest aggression, instead favoring more fluid or structured forms. The overall subdued atmosphere and the presence of small, scattered white flecks, reminiscent of stars, lean more towards a somber or ethereal quality, completely devoid of any fiery or explosive emotional content related to anger."
the-signal-1915.jpg,Cubism,88.5,"The painting conveys a profound and palpable sense of anger through several striking visual elements. Firstly, the pervasive and dominant use of vivid, fiery red across a large portion of the canvas immediately evokes strong associations with rage, passion, and intense conflict. This is not a gentle or warm red, but a turbulent, almost aggressive hue. Secondly, the most direct and potent symbol of anger is the shadowy, distorted figure on the right side, whose eyes glow with an ominous, almost demonic red. This specific detail acts as an unambiguous beacon of malevolence and intense fury, powerfully communicating a hostile presence. Furthermore, the overall composition is one of agitation and turmoil. The brushstrokes are energetic, gestural, and unrestrained, creating swirling, fragmented forms that suggest a violent upheaval or struggle. This chaotic dynamism, coupled with the dark, brooding undertones and the implied conflict within the scene, reinforces a sense of simmering or erupting rage. While clear facial expressions are not discernible, the sheer expressive force of the color, the symbolic imagery of the red eyes, and the overall tumultuous atmosphere coalesce to make anger a remarkably prominent and overwhelming emotion within this work."
the-sand-crab.jpg,Cubism,65.0,"The artwork evokes a significant sense of anger through its sharp, angular, and fragmented forms. The prominent jagged lines and pointed shapes, particularly noticeable in the upper central area resembling bared teeth or menacing claws, immediately suggest aggression and hostility. These aggressive visual elements create a confrontational atmosphere. Furthermore, the wide, intense, and somewhat bulging eyes embedded within the geometric chaos convey a powerful emotional state, which could be interpreted as intense agitation or a simmering rage, rather than fear or surprise. The overall fragmented and disjointed composition contributes to a feeling of tension and turmoil, mirroring an internal state of distress or anger. While there isn't a literal depiction of a scowling face, the pervasive use of sharp, unsettling elements and the intense gaze strongly communicate a potent, almost raw, undercurrent of anger or aggressive energy within the abstract forms."
the-three-graces.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is no discernible element within this painting that evokes or portrays anger. The expressions on the faces of the three figures are either neutral, pensive, or slightly alluring, but none convey rage, frustration, or hostility. The poses of the figures are relaxed and composed; there is no tense body language or aggressive gesture. The interaction between the women appears calm, with gentle touches, rather than confrontational. The vibrant color palette, while bold, does not carry the harshness or intensity often associated with anger. The setting, an artist's studio, depicts a serene, artistic environment. There is no narrative element suggesting conflict, injustice, or any situation that would typically elicit an angry response from either the subjects or the viewer. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of quiet contemplation or a posed study, completely devoid of any angsty undertones."
the-trapeze-artists-1922.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting does not strongly evoke the emotion of anger. There are no visual cues such as aggressive postures, harsh facial expressions, or confrontational interactions among the figures. The figures, though dynamic and in motion, display no signs of rage, frustration, or hostility; their expressions are either neutral or obscured by the stylized brushwork. While the use of red in the women's clothing can sometimes be associated with strong emotions, in this context, it appears more as a vibrant, energetic color choice rather than a symbol of fury. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the swirling lines, light colors of the umbrellas, and lively composition suggests movement, celebration, or a dream-like state, rather than conflict or aggression. The general aesthetic is more about abstract form and kinetic energy than emotional intensity related to anger. Therefore, the presence of anger is virtually non-existent, scoring very low on the scale."
the-sailor-self-portrait-1912.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting exhibits very minimal visual cues that directly convey the emotion of anger. The sailor's face, while highly stylized with sharp, angular planes characteristic of a modernist approach, lacks any conventional expressions of rage or fury. His blue eyes, though direct, do not glare, narrow, or show any intensity typical of anger; rather, they appear somewhat calm or perhaps introspective. The mouth is depicted as a simple, unexpressive line, devoid of any snarl, grimace, or tension. There are no furrowed brows, clenched jaws, or tense muscles visible. The color palette, predominantly warm orange and yellow for the face, does not employ the aggressive reds or dark, brooding tones often associated with anger. While the fragmented nature of the figure and the abstract, shadowy background elements might evoke a sense of psychological complexity or unease, these do not specifically translate into an outward or even internalized depiction of anger. There is no aggressive body language or implied conflict. Any perceived anger would be a very subtle and indirect interpretation derived from the general disquiet or starkness of the avant-garde style, rather than a clear portrayal of the emotion itself."
the-viaduct.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, with its stark, geometric forms, bold black outlines, and industrial aesthetic, presents a fragmented and somewhat deconstructed view of what appears to be an urban or factory landscape. While there are no overt signs of anger such as agitated figures, violent imagery, or chaotic brushwork, a very subtle undercurrent of potential tension or harshness might be inferred by some. The rigid lines and the stark contrast between the bright, flat colors and the heavy black outlines could be perceived as cold or unyielding, which, in an abstract sense, might touch upon a very remote, almost imperceptible sense of latent frustration or an unfeeling, mechanistic world. The sharp angles and structural fragmentation, while characteristic of the style, could also evoke a sense of disquiet rather than comfort. However, this is a very mild and indirect interpretation, as the overall impression is more one of industrial dynamism and compositional analysis rather than emotional turmoil. The feeling of anger is extremely minimal and not explicitly present; any such interpretation would be highly subjective and stretched."
the-studio-ix-1954.jpg,Cubism,22.5,"The painting evokes a subtle, underlying sense of agitation or frustration rather than overt rage. This is primarily conveyed through the fractured and disjointed composition, particularly in the upper section. The presence of sharp, angular forms and dark, fragmented shapes, especially the yellow and black geometric elements in the upper right, creates a visual tension and discord. These elements disrupt the harmony of the picture plane, suggesting a state of disarray or ""brokenness"" that could implicitly lead to feelings of frustration or irritation. The overall dark and somber color palette further contributes to a heavy atmosphere, lacking any mitigating brightness or fluidity that might calm such feelings. While there are no explicit depictions of violence, figures expressing anger, or dynamic, aggressive brushstrokes, the chaotic arrangement and the implied fragmentation of what might be recognizable objects (like the musical instrument on the left) can be interpreted as a silent manifestation of a world in disharmony, which, for some viewers, could resonate with a subdued form of anger or resentment over a lack of order or integrity. However, the anger is not an active, explosive force; it is rather a quiet, simmering unease or a melancholic recognition of disjunction."
the-violin-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this painting that conveys anger. The subject matter, primarily musical instruments (a violin and a piano), is inherently associated with harmony, expression, and aesthetic pleasure, not conflict or rage. The vibrant palette, dominated by warm reds and bright blues and yellows, creates an energetic and lively atmosphere rather than one of hostility or aggression. While red can sometimes be linked to strong emotions, its application here on the violin and the body of the piano suggests passion or warmth, not an inflamed or furious state. There are no harsh, clashing colors or dark, brooding tones that might induce feelings of anger. The fragmented, cubist-influenced composition, while dynamic, feels more like an intellectual exploration of form and perspective rather than an emotional outpouring of frustration or fury. There are no figures depicted, nor any violent or distressed imagery. In fact, a small, subtle yellow oval on the red pyramid-like structure appears to have a simple, almost smiley-face-like marking, which, if anything, points towards a lighthearted or benign sensibility, further distancing the work from any hint of anger. The brushwork, though visible and textural, does not appear aggressive or turbulent. The overall impression is one of artistic experimentation and musicality, completely devoid of any emotional charge related to anger."
the-wash-stand-1942.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke or suggest the emotion of anger. The color palette, while containing deep reds, utilizes them in a rich, earthy, and grounding manner rather than with any fiery or aggressive intensity that might be associated with rage. The subject matter, a still life depicting common household objects like a pitcher and what appears to be bread, is inherently tranquil and devoid of any confrontational or disturbing narrative. The forms are rendered with a deliberate, somewhat abstracted calm, and there are no sharp, jagged lines or chaotic brushstrokes that would typically convey agitation or fury. The overall composition is stable and contemplative, lacking any dynamic tension or visual disruption that might imply a feeling of resentment or hostility. The mood conveyed is one of quiet introspection and domesticity, completely absent of any trace of anger."
the-studio-viii-1954.jpg,Cubism,70.0,"The emotion of anger is strongly present in this painting, primarily emanating from the monstrous, snarling figure positioned at the bottom. This creature's jagged, sharp teeth, wide-open mouth, and aggressive posture directly evoke a primal sense of rage and ferocity. Its very form screams aggression, contributing significantly to the feeling of anger within the artwork.

Beyond this direct representation, the large expanses of deep red and maroon tones throughout the composition also contribute to an atmosphere that can be associated with anger, intensity, and warning. These heavy blocks of color create a sense of pressure or confrontation. Furthermore, the overall fragmented and angular composition, with its clashing shapes and lines, introduces a feeling of tension, disharmony, and internal struggle, which can often be precursors or manifestations of frustration and anger. The chaotic environment and the potentially oppressive nature of the large color blocks can suggest a scenario that might provoke feelings of irritation or fury. While other elements in the painting might suggest different emotions, focusing solely on anger, its presence is undeniable and potent, channeled through the clear aggression of the monster and supported by the intense color scheme and disjointed structure."
three-nudes-in-the-forest.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are absolutely no discernible elements within this artwork that convey or evoke the emotion of anger. The figures, rendered in flat, simplified forms with muted facial features, exhibit no expressions of rage, frustration, or hostility. Their body language is either relaxed (the recumbent yellow figure), curled (the other yellow figure), or passively observant (the grey background figures), none of which suggest aggression or internal turmoil associated with anger. There are no sharp, aggressive lines that might imply tension or conflict, nor is there any depiction of confrontation or violence between the subjects. The color palette, consisting of bright yellow, earthy greens, dark greys, and deep reds, does not create a sense of discord or fury; instead, the colors are used in a decorative and somewhat harmonious manner. The red background elements, while a strong color, appear as architectural or structural components rather than symbols of ire. The overall atmosphere is one of calm, perhaps contemplation or a dream-like state, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would lead one to perceive anger."
three-figures.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The depiction of anger in this artwork is virtually absent. There are no strong visual cues typically associated with this emotion. The color palette, while containing some muted tones, lacks the vivid reds, deep blacks, or jarring contrasts often used to convey rage or intensity. The figures, being highly abstract and angular, do not display explicit angry facial expressions (e.g., furrowed brows, bared teeth) or aggressive body language (e.g., clenched fists, violent gestures). The outstretched line from the left figure towards the right one could be interpreted as pointing or reaching, but it lacks the forceful or aggressive energy of an angry confrontation. While the lines are bold and somewhat jagged, suggesting a certain rigidity or tension, this tension does not translate directly or strongly into anger; it's more indicative of the Cubist/abstract style itself or a general sense of being rather than an emotional outburst. The overall atmosphere conveyed is more one of abstract composition or perhaps quiet contemplation rather than emotional fury or rage."
three-girls-on-red-background-composition-with-three-women-1927.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting conveys an almost complete absence of anger. The figures' faces are highly simplified and stylized, lacking any discernible expressions such as furrowed brows, gritted teeth, or tense mouths that would indicate anger. Their eyes are depicted as blank or neutral, offering no emotional cues. Furthermore, their body language is static, stiff, and monumental, devoid of any gestures, postures, or dynamic tension typically associated with feelings of rage, frustration, or aggression. The figure on the left holds a stylized flower, an object often associated with peace, beauty, or tenderness, which further detracts from any potential interpretation of anger. The geometric, almost robotic depiction of the forms emphasizes structure and solidity rather than volatile human emotion. While the red background is a strong and vibrant color that can sometimes be associated with anger, in this context, it functions more as a bold and stark backdrop for the monochrome figures, not as an amplification of their emotional state. The overall impression is one of calm, stoicism, or perhaps detachment, rather than any form of agitated or aggressive emotion. A score very close to zero is given to acknowledge the subjective nature of art interpretation, while strongly indicating the pervasive lack of any visual cues for anger in the artwork itself."
trees-by-the-water-1900.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no visual or emotional cue within this painting that suggests anger. The artwork is characterized by its soft, translucent watercolor washes, depicting a serene and somewhat abstract landscape. The palette consists primarily of muted greens, blues, and earthy tones, which are inherently calming and natural, rather than conveying any sense of aggression, frustration, or hostility. The brushstrokes are loose and fluid, lacking any sharp, violent, or agitated quality. There are no harsh contrasts, clashing colors, or dynamic, confrontational forms that might evoke anger. The composition is open and contemplative, devoid of any tension or discord. The overall impression is one of tranquility, gentle contemplation, and a harmonious connection with nature, which stands in direct opposition to the emotion of anger."
tracking-down-guiltless-doves.jpg,Cubism,12.0,"The painting exhibits a very low degree of anger. While the composition is highly dynamic with energetic brushstrokes and sharp, fragmented forms, these elements do not coalesce into a clear expression of rage or hostility. The vibrant reds, often associated with passion or warning, are used alongside bold blacks and lively yellows and greens in a way that feels more expressive and spontaneous rather than aggressive or furious. The thick impasto application of paint suggests a certain raw energy and immediacy, but this energy translates more into a sense of lively movement or chaotic playfulness rather than violent agitation. There are no discernible visual cues typically associated with anger, such as menacing or overtly aggressive forms, a sense of confinement or struggle, or a clashing color palette designed to evoke discord or wrath. The abstract shapes, while occasionally pointed, appear to be in a dynamic dance rather than engaged in conflict driven by anger. The overall impression is one of abstract vitality and perhaps a touch of whimsy, with little to no undertone of ire or emotional turmoil."
title-unknown-coty-1917.jpg,Cubism,3.0,"The painting displays an exceptionally low degree of anger. There are no visual cues within the composition that directly evoke or express this emotion. The lines, while angular and fragmented, do not possess the sharp, aggressive quality typically associated with rage or violence; instead, they contribute to the deconstruction of form characteristic of Cubism. Furthermore, the figures depicted, particularly the nude female forms, are rendered without any hint of emotional distress, fury, or hostile intent; their expressions, where discernible, are neutral or detached, and their poses do not convey aggression. The color palette, composed of a variety of earth tones, blues, greens, and some muted reds, lacks the intense, clashing, or fiery hues that often signify anger or volatile emotion. There are no scenes of conflict, destruction, or overt struggle. The overall fragmented and mechanical aesthetic seems to explore themes of modern life, dynamism, and the human form through an intellectual rather than an emotionally charged lens. The presence of elements like playing cards and flowers further detracts from any potential interpretation of anger, introducing instead notions of leisure or aesthetic beauty. The composition, while complex and perhaps unsettling due to its abstraction, does not present any elements that suggest animosity, resentment, or wrath."
uknown.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent in this artwork. The geometric and highly stylized forms, while sharp and angular, are characteristic of the Constructivist or Futurist style and do not inherently convey aggression or fury. The figures, depicted in dynamic, almost acrobatic poses, seem engaged in a performance or a controlled, mechanical movement rather than expressing intense human emotion. Their faces are abstracted to flat planes with minimal features, completely lacking any angry expressions such as furrowed brows, tense mouths, or piercing glares. The color palette, though featuring strong blues and reds, does not evoke a sense of rage; the red, for instance, appears more theatrical or vibrant than indicative of anger. There are no violent actions, confrontational stances, or chaotic elements in the composition that would suggest an undercurrent of anger. The overall impression is one of dynamic balance and artistic abstraction, devoid of any emotional turmoil related to anger. A minimal score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the slight visual tension that *could* be interpreted by some as a very, very subtle and abstract hint of rigidity or force, but this is far removed from a true depiction of anger."
two-men-with-cockerel.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting presents no discernible visual cues or thematic elements that evoke a sense of anger. The fragmented, geometric style, while abstracting forms, does so in a manner that creates a serene and contemplative atmosphere rather than one of tension or hostility. The colors are predominantly muted and earthy, lacking the sharp contrasts or vibrant, aggressive tones often associated with intense negative emotions like rage. Neither of the human figures displays any body language or facial expression (even through abstraction) that suggests agitation, frustration, or fury; their postures are calm and introspective. The woman gently holds a white cat, a gesture indicative of tenderness and peace, starkly contrasting with any notion of anger. The rooster, while an animal that can be aggressive, is depicted in a static, non-confrontational stance. There is no narrative depicted that implies conflict, injustice, or any source of indignation. The overall impression is one of quietude and domestic observation, rendering the emotion of anger virtually absent from the viewer's interpretation of the artwork."
three-women-1908.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The emotion of anger is almost entirely absent in ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon."" There are no explicit visual cues typically associated with anger in the figures' facial expressions or body language. Their faces, particularly the mask-like countenances on the right, are stylized and impassive, lacking the furrowed brows, narrowed eyes, or tensed mouths that would indicate rage. Similarly, the figures' postures are static and monumental, devoid of any aggressive or agitated movements, such as clenched fists or a ready-to-strike stance. While the painting's fragmented forms and direct gazes can create a sense of unease or confrontation for the viewer, this is more a function of Picasso's revolutionary artistic style and depiction of challenging subject matter, rather than an expression of anger emanating from the subjects themselves. The color palette, dominated by warm oranges and earthy tones, lacks the stark, aggressive reds often associated with intense anger. Any minimal hint"
trouville-1911.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in Fernand Léger's ""The City."" The painting's Cubist fragmentation, while creating a sense of dynamic energy and perhaps the overwhelming nature of urban life, does not visually translate into feelings of rage, hostility, or fury. There is an absence of an aggressive color palette; the dominant browns, grays, blues, and yellows are more industrial and subdued than confrontational or passionate. There are no fiery reds or jarring, clashing colors that might evoke irritation or aggression. Furthermore, the abstracted figures, reduced to geometric forms, lack any discernible angry facial expressions or postures that would convey emotional turmoil. Their forms are sturdy and monumental, suggesting mechanical function or collective movement rather than individual struggle or aggression. While the dense composition and sharp angles could be interpreted as creating a somewhat jarring or disorienting effect, this is more akin to the objective portrayal of modern urban dynamism than an expression of internal anger or conflict. The overall impression is one of analytical deconstruction and reconstruction of the city environment, emphasizing its structure and rhythm, rather than any emotional outburst or resentment against it. Any hint of anger would be extremely subtle and indirect, perhaps stemming from a viewer's subjective interpretation of the dehumanizing aspects of industrialization, but this is not directly conveyed by the artistic elements themselves."
varanasi-iii-1973.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no visual cues within this artwork that evoke or suggest anger. The overall mood is one of tranquility and ritualistic movement, depicting figures seemingly engaged in bathing or purification. The line art is fluid and calm, lacking any sharp, agitated, or forceful strokes that might convey aggression or frustration. The postures of the figures, whether bent in contemplation or pouring water, are serene and unthreatening. There are no clashing elements, tense interactions, or expressions of distress. The dominant imagery of the sun, water, and human figures performing a peaceful act creates a contemplative and harmonious atmosphere, antithetical to any sensation of anger."
untitled-3.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting does not prominently feature anger as a dominant emotion. The abstract and geometric style of the figures inherently minimizes the ability to discern specific, nuanced facial expressions that might convey rage or fury. While bold lines and fragmented forms are present, they are characteristic of the artistic style rather than indicators of emotional turmoil. The color red is used within the composition, which can sometimes be associated with anger or intensity, but here it appears integrated into the figures and structure (e.g., on breasts, lower body, and building roof) rather than being deployed as an eruptive or violent burst of color. Furthermore, the body language of the figures does not suggest aggression, confrontation, or violent intent. The figure on the left stands stoically, the central figure is kneeling, possibly in a gesture of humility or engagement, and the figure on the right, while raising a hand, does so in a manner that could be interpreted as a plea, instruction, or a blessing, rather than a gesture of attack or intense indignation. There are no visual cues such as clenched fists, furrowed brows, open screaming mouths, or tense, aggressive postures that would clearly communicate anger. The overall impression is more of interaction, narrative, or perhaps contemplation, with any underlying emotions being subtle and open to multiple interpretations, none of which strongly lean towards anger."
view-of-notre-dame-1914.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting predominantly features cool, subdued tones of blue, which typically evoke feelings of calm, contemplation, or melancholy, rather than intense anger. Anger is often associated with warm, fiery colors like reds, oranges, or sharp, jarring contrasts, none of which are prominent here. While there are some dark, almost black areas, especially around the top rectangular form, they contribute more to a sense of depth or shadow than to an aggressive or furious mood. The brushstrokes, though visible and textural, do not possess the frenetic, violent, or agitated quality that might suggest an angry outpouring of emotion. The abstract forms and linear elements are structured and somewhat geometric, lacking the chaotic disarray or threatening tension that could hint at anger. There are no discernible figures expressing rage, nor is there any narrative content that might depict a scene of conflict or indignation. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the artwork is one of quietude, introspection, or perhaps a serene melancholy, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger a feeling of anger. Therefore, the emotion of anger is virtually absent in this piece."
view-towards-the-danube-1933.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The painting does not evoke a strong sense of anger. There are no figures expressing rage or conflict, nor are there any destructive or chaotic elements typically associated with anger. The vibrant, somewhat un-naturalistic colors (like the bright yellow house) and the angular, simplified forms are characteristic of Expressionism, a movement that often explores emotional states. While this style can convey intensity, in this particular painting, the intensity manifests more as expressive dynamism rather than aggressive emotion. The dark, turbulent sky might suggest an underlying tension or dramatic atmosphere, akin to a brewing storm, which could metaphorically be linked to a heightened emotional state. However, this atmospheric tension does not translate directly into a feeling of human anger or aggression. The overall impression is more of an expressive landscape with a dramatic sky than a scene filled with rage or hostility."
two-women-with-the-toilet-final-state-1920.jpg,Cubism,3.0,"The painting, with its precise geometric forms, cool color palette, and structured composition, exhibits very little, if any, discernible anger. The dominance of blacks, whites, grays, and muted earth tones, along with the occasional cool blue or yellow, does not evoke the fiery intensity or agitation often associated with anger. There are no harsh, jarring, or chaotic elements in the forms or lines that would suggest aggression or violent emotion; instead, the forms are solid, volumetric, and meticulously arranged, conveying a sense of order and mechanical precision rather than emotional turmoil.

While the fragmented and abstract nature of the ""figures"" and the dense, industrial landscape might be interpreted by some as dehumanizing or overwhelming, leading to a sense of alienation or frustration, this is a highly indirect and subjective path to anger. The painting itself does not actively express this emotion through its visual language. There are no angry gestures, expressions, or violent actions depicted. The brushwork appears smooth and controlled, lacking the energetic or aggressive strokes that might convey emotional intensity. The overall feeling is one of cool observation and an embrace of the dynamism and structure of the modern machine age, rather than a protest or expression of discontent rooted in anger. The elements serve to create a sense of mechanical rhythm and urban complexity, which are far removed from any direct portrayal of anger."
untitled-1.jpg!PinterestLarge.jpg,Cubism,52.0,"The visual elements within this artwork evoke a notable, albeit abstract, sense of anger. The primary contributors to this feeling are the sharp, angular, and fragmented lines and shapes that dominate the composition. These elements convey a feeling of disruption, tension, and a lack of harmony, which can be closely associated with feelings of agitation and frustration – common precursors or components of anger. The stark black, white, and grey palette, devoid of warm or soothing colors, further amplifies this sensation, lending a harsh, unyielding, and confrontational quality to the piece. There's an absence of softness or organic flow; instead, the lines often appear forceful, cutting, or abruptly broken, suggesting a vigorous, almost aggressive energy. The dynamic, non-linear movement within the drawing, with shapes seeming to push against each other or be in a state of flux, can be interpreted as visual discord or conflict. This relentless visual tension and the assertive, almost jarring nature of the forms prevent any sense of calm or peace, instead fostering an undercurrent of disquiet and the potential for explosive emotion. While not depicting explicit rage, the inherent visual friction and the fragmented, almost fractured structure subtly resonate with the feeling of anger's disruptive and forceful nature."
vytautas-kairiukstis-kubistinis-portretas-imagelarge.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The visual language of this painting largely lacks elements typically associated with the emotion of anger. The color palette is predominantly cool and muted, featuring shades of cream, light blue, light pink, greys, and browns, with significant areas of black. These colors do not inherently convey rage or intense passion; instead, they lend themselves to a sense of calm, introspection, or intellectual detachment. There is a small, elongated orange/red shape, possibly representing a mouth or a facial feature, which is the only color that might hold a subtle association with heat or intensity. However, its small size and isolated placement prevent it from dominating the emotional landscape of the artwork and it does not appear as a violent or aggressive burst of color.

Furthermore, the lines and shapes are primarily geometric, straight, and well-defined, contributing to an overall sense of order and structure rather than chaos or aggression. There are no jagged, sharp, or explosive forms that would typically denote an angry outburst. The composition feels balanced and composed, without any disorienting or clashing elements that might suggest internal turmoil or external conflict. Even in its abstract depiction of what appears to be a stylized head, there are no features that suggest a scowl, tension, or a loud expression. The two subtle lines within the large cream semi-circle (possibly eyes) are horizontal and calm, not furrowed or expressive of displeasure. The overall impression is one of calculated design and quiet contemplation, rather than emotional volatility or fury. Any hint of anger is extremely subdued, almost imperceptible, and certainly not the dominant emotional force of the piece."
woman-on-a-balcony-1914.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The color palette, while vibrant and featuring strong reds, uses these hues in a decorative and composed manner across the landscape and interior elements, rather than to express agitation or rage. The geometric fragmentation and bold outlines contribute to a sense of dynamism and artistic structure, not emotional turmoil or aggression. The figure is depicted from behind, looking out, with a posture that appears calm or contemplative, entirely devoid of any visual cues associated with anger, such as tension, distress, or aggressive action. There are no harsh brushstrokes, jarring compositions, or disturbing imagery that would elicit or represent anger. The overall impression is one of contemplative observation and harmonious design, leaving no room for an interpretation of anger."
the-mutilated-1943.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The emotion of anger is minimally present in this painting, if at all, warranting a very low score. There are no overt visual cues that suggest rage, hostility, or confrontation. The facial features of both figures are highly stylized, making it impossible to discern specific angry expressions like furrowed brows, bared teeth, or tense mouths. Furthermore, their body language does not convey aggression; the figure on the left appears somewhat hunched or contemplative, while the figure on the right raises a hand in a gesture commonly associated with peace or victory, or perhaps a signal to stop or communicate, which directly contradicts the notion of anger. There are no clenched fists, no aggressive posturing, and no dynamic, volatile movements that would imply an angry outburst. The lines used to define the figures are fluid and rounded rather than sharp, jagged, or chaotic, which often signify emotional turmoil or tension. While the background features a bold red field, a color sometimes associated with strong emotions including anger, its application here as a broad, flat ground rather than a highlight of emotional expression within the figures themselves diminishes its connection to anger in the context of the subjects. The overall atmosphere seems more subdued, perhaps indicative of a discussion, a moment of reflection, or even a gentle interaction, rather than a heated exchange. The presence of canes suggests a theme of support or physical limitation, further steering away from an angry narrative."
woman-with-mandolin-1925.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no visual elements within this painting that convey or elicit a sense of anger. The subject's facial expression is serene and contemplative, lacking any signs of furrowed brows, narrowed eyes, or tightened lips typically associated with this emotion. Her posture in the chair is relaxed and open, with no indication of tension, rigidity, or aggressive body language. The hands, gently holding the instrument and paper, are calm and un-clenched. The color palette, while featuring strong blues and reds, does not utilize them in a way that suggests turmoil or rage; rather, the colors contribute to the overall contemplative and somewhat minimalist aesthetic. The composition itself is balanced and stable, devoid of any chaotic or dynamic elements that might hint at internal or external conflict. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of quiet introspection and calm, making the presence of anger entirely absent."
workbox.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is no discernible element within this painting that evokes or suggests the emotion of anger. The subject matter comprises commonplace, domestic items associated with sewing—scissors, thread, a thimble, lace, a measuring stick, and what appears to be a keyhole. These objects are inherently mundane and utilitarian, devoid of any aggressive or confrontational connotations. The painting's Cubist-inspired fragmentation, while breaking down objects into geometric planes, does so in an analytical and structured manner rather than a chaotic or violent one. The composition, despite its multiple viewpoints, feels organized and still, contributing to a contemplative, quiet atmosphere. The color palette, dominated by earthy browns, muted reds, and soft blues and whites, is warm and harmonious, lacking the sharp contrasts, jarring intensity, or brooding darkness often associated with feelings of anger. The brushwork appears controlled, not frantic or expressive of agitation. There are no figures expressing rage, no violent actions depicted, nor any visual cues (such as sharp, chaotic lines, aggressive textures, or unsettling juxtapositions) that might provoke or reflect anger. The overall impression is one of calm observation and a systematic deconstruction of everyday objects, leaving no room for the emergence of this strong emotion."
wild-garden-1959.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting displays no visual elements that evoke or convey the emotion of anger. There are no aggressive or clashing color combinations (such as harsh reds or violent blacks), nor is there any chaotic, frenzied, or destructive brushwork. The forms, though fragmented and abstract, are primarily organic or decorative in nature, lacking any sharp, menacing, or confrontational qualities. There are no discernible figures or scenes depicting conflict, rage, frustration, or injustice. The overall composition, while intricate and perhaps disorienting due to its abstract fragmentation, does not suggest hostility, aggression, or any form of outward or inward fury. The visual language of the artwork is entirely devoid of the characteristics typically associated with anger."
woman-and-bird-1930.jpg,Cubism,3.5,"The painting, with its cubist or expressionistic style, utilizes bold lines and strong, contrasting colors, particularly red, which can often be associated with intense emotions, including anger. The angular and somewhat fragmented portrayal of the figure, especially the face, creates a sense of starkness and a lack of softness. The dark, somewhat hollowed eye areas and the simplified, unsmiling mouth could be interpreted by some as conveying a rigid or unyielding presence, which might be a subtle undertone to a suppressed or stoic intensity.

However, despite these elements, the direct visual cues for anger are largely absent. There is no visible furrowing of the brow, no open mouth suggesting a yell or scream, no gritted teeth, nor any sense of explosive or uncontrolled movement in the brushstrokes. The red is used as a prominent color for the figure's face and body, but it reads more as a deliberate stylistic choice for visual impact and definition rather than a depiction of a flushed, enraged countenance. The overall composition feels controlled and deliberate, rather than reflecting chaotic or violent emotions. While the strong contrasts and sharp angles create a certain visual tension, this tension leans more towards artistic intensity or formal structure than the specific emotion of anger emanating from the depicted subject or the overall atmosphere of the piece. Therefore, any perceived anger is extremely subtle, indirect, and primarily an interpretation of stylistic choices rather than a clear emotional portrayal."
zinc-1917.jpg,Cubism,90.5,"The painting strongly evokes anger through several compelling visual and symbolic elements. The central figure, rendered in an intense, almost blood-red hue, is depicted in a pose reminiscent of a crucifixion, arms outstretched in what appears to be agony or profound distress. This imagery immediately brings to mind themes of immense suffering, injustice, and sacrifice, which are potent catalysts for anger, both from the perspective of the suffering figure and the observer. The facial features, though somewhat abstract, suggest a grimace or a scream, conveying a visceral outpouring of emotion that leans heavily into anguish and a defiant rage against its predicament.

The stark contrast between the suffering figure and the bold, almost industrial word ""ZINC"" emblazoned above it creates a jarring dissonance. This juxtaposition can be interpreted as a commentary on the commercialization, devaluation, or indifference towards profound human suffering in a modern, material world, inciting a powerful sense of outrage and indignation. The very presence of such a mundane word in conjunction with a figure of such intense spiritual or physical torment fuels a feeling of anger at the desecration or trivialization of life and meaning.

Furthermore, the overall composition is fragmented and dynamic, characterized by bold lines, sharp angles, and rough, textured surfaces. This visual discord contributes to a sense of unease and psychological tension, mirroring the agitation and ferocity associated with anger. The isolated, watchful eye on the left, with its red pupil, appears to witness the central drama, potentially embodying a sense of indignant observation or even an enraged silent scream from an unseen presence. The raw, almost unfinished quality of the paint application adds to the visceral impact, making the emotional expression feel immediate and unbridled. The intensity of the red color, often associated with blood, passion, and rage, permeates the central subject, further amplifying the feeling of profound anger emanating from or directed towards the scene."
