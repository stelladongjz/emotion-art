01Klimt-Beethovenfries.png,leslie,0.0,"The visual elements in this section of Gustav Klimt's ""Beethoven Frieze"" do not evoke any discernible feeling of disgust. The artwork features highly stylized figures, rich decorative patterns, and extensive use of gold, which collectively contribute to an ethereal and symbolic aesthetic rather than one that is unpleasant or offensive. The nude embracing couple is depicted with tenderness and spiritual connection, not in a manner that is crude, vulgar, or designed to cause revulsion. Similarly, the figures on the left, representing suffering and human longing, are rendered with a sense of melancholic beauty or fragility rather than grotesque or decaying forms. There are no depictions of filth, decay, gore, or any other traditionally repulsive imagery. The overall impression is one of beauty, symbolism, and a profound artistic statement, none of which align with the sensation of disgust."
07Monet-nympheas.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This painting, Claude Monet's ""The Japanese Footbridge"" (or ""Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies""), evokes feelings of tranquility, beauty, and peacefulness. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that would elicit a sensation of disgust. The subject matter—a bridge gracefully arching over a pond filled with vibrant water lilies and surrounded by lush, green foliage—is inherently natural and aesthetically pleasing. The colors are fresh and harmonious, dominated by various shades of green and the subtle hints of pink and yellow in the water lilies, all contributing to a sense of vitality and calm. The Impressionistic brushwork, while dynamic, is not chaotic or disturbing; instead, it captures the play of light and reflections on the water in a captivating manner. There is no depiction of decay, filth, disease, unpleasant bodily matter, or any grotesque or morally repugnant imagery that is typically associated with feelings of disgust. The scene is one of pristine natural beauty, designed to soothe and delight the viewer, rather than provoke any form of aversion or revulsion."
100painting-04.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This painting evokes feelings of peace, serenity, and admiration for natural beauty. It depicts a pristine mountain landscape with snow-capped peaks, a clear blue lake, and lush green forests under a bright sky. There are no elements within the artwork that could be interpreted as unhygienic, offensive, decaying, or otherwise unpleasant. The colors are vibrant and harmonious, the subject matter is benign and universally appealing, and the overall impression is one of tranquility and freshness. Consequently, there is nothing present in the image that would trigger any sensation of disgust."
103red-plum-painting-water.jpg,leslie,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The primary subject, a plum-like fruit, is depicted with a vibrant red hue, suggesting ripeness and freshness, rather than spoilage or decay. Its skin appears smooth and healthy, with natural variations in color and subtle reflections that convey a clean and appealing surface. The small droplets or streaks of liquid on the wooden surface beneath the fruit also appear clear and clean, possibly indicating juice or water, which further emphasizes freshness or juiciness, as opposed to grime or a repulsive residue. There are no visual cues such as mold, bruising suggestive of rot, insect infestation, or an unhygienic environment that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or unease. The warm, earthy color palette and simple composition contribute to a pleasant and benign aesthetic, completely devoid of elements that would typically provoke disgust. The slight score above zero is merely a theoretical acknowledgement of the infinitesimally small, almost imperceptible chance that any viewer might, for highly idiosyncratic reasons, associate something within the image (e.g., the moistness) with an unpleasant sensation, though this is highly unlikely given the clear visual cues of freshness."
104Strawberries_oil_painting_by_belka10.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject matter, fresh and vibrant strawberries, is inherently appealing and associated with pleasant sensations like sweetness and ripeness. Visually, the strawberries are depicted with rich, healthy red tones, plump forms, and intact green caps, all indicative of freshness and desirability. There are no elements within the painting—such as decay, mold, pests, unnatural colors, or any sign of contamination or spoilage—that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or unpleasantness. On the contrary, the artwork highlights the delicious and inviting qualities of the fruit, making any experience of disgust entirely absent."
111abstract.jpg,leslie,2.5,"The painting, being an abstract work, inherently lacks the direct, recognizable elements typically associated with eliciting disgust, such as depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, disease, or grotesque forms. The palette consists primarily of greys, blacks, white, and a striking gold/ochre, along with some muted blues and browns. These colors, while perhaps conveying a sense of drama or turbulence, are not inherently nauseating or repulsive. The textures, characterized by thick impasto, bold brushstrokes, and energetic splatters, suggest a dynamic and raw expressive quality rather than anything slimy, putrid, or unsanitary. There is no visual information that suggests contamination, foulness, or any subject matter that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or a desire to recoil from something perceived as offensive or threatening to one's health or well-being. While abstract art can sometimes create feelings of unease or discomfort through dissonance, the aesthetic here leans more towards a powerful, perhaps turbulent, but ultimately non-repugnant visual experience. Therefore, the capacity of this painting to evoke disgust is extremely low, bordering on non-existent."
114Degas Dancers pastel 1899.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke the emotion of disgust. The artwork depicts three dancers in a soft, painterly style, likely rendered in pastel. The subject matter itself—dancers—is typically associated with grace, beauty, and artistic expression, not with anything repulsive. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, waste, decay, illness, or anything visually grotesque or unsettling that would typically trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. The figures are rendered with a degree of naturalism, and while the artist's technique involves visible, textural strokes, these do not create a sense of grubbiness or unpleasantness; rather, they contribute to the atmospheric quality of the work. The colors are generally warm and earthy, with blues and purples, and are harmoniously blended, posing no jarring or sickly visual stimuli. There is no narrative or contextual suggestion within the image that implies anything vile, unsanitary, or morally corrupt that might lead to a feeling of revulsion. The poses of the dancers appear natural and focused, devoid of any contortion or expression that would be perceived as nauseating or repugnant. Consequently, the painting presents no visual or thematic cues that align with the experience of disgust."
115broadway.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in Piet Mondrian's ""Broadway Boogie Woogie"" that elicits any sense of disgust. The painting is a prime example of abstract art, characterized by a clean, highly structured grid of yellow lines interspersed with blocks of primary colors (red, blue) and white. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by something offensive, repulsive, unclean, or morally objectionable. This artwork, however, presents none of these qualities. Its geometric precision, vibrant but harmoniously arranged colors, and non-representational nature leave no room for such an interpretation. There are no disturbing visual elements, no depiction of decay or squalor, no chaotic or messy forms that might evoke repulsion. Instead, the painting conveys a sense of rhythmic energy and meticulous order, inspired by the vitality of urban life and jazz music, qualities that are antithetical to disgust. The overall aesthetic is one of cleanliness, balance, and visual dynamism, prompting engagement rather than aversion."
120step_by_step.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that would elicit a feeling of disgust. The subject is a Yorkshire Terrier, a breed widely considered cute and endearing, especially depicted with a sweet expression and a bow. The artistic style is a vibrant, painterly approach with visible brushstrokes, which contributes to a lively and appealing aesthetic rather than anything messy or unhygienic. The colors are warm and inviting, and the overall composition presents a charming and domestic scene. There are no visual elements, textures, or implied conditions (such as sickness, dirt, decay, or unpleasantness) that would trigger a sensation of revulsion, aversion, or nausea. The painting evokes feelings of warmth, cuteness, and affection, which are antithetical to disgust."
122acrylic-painting.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes disgust. The scene depicts a tranquil, autumnal rural landscape with a barn, a vibrant fall tree, a winding path, and distant hills with a church steeple. The colors are warm and inviting, dominated by golden yellows, oranges, and various shades of green and blue. The brushwork is expressive and rich, creating a sense of texture and light, but it does not suggest anything unhygienic, offensive, or repulsive. The subject matter itself is inherently benign and often associated with feelings of calm and nostalgia, rather than aversion. There are no disturbing elements, unpleasant details, or anything that would trigger a visceral negative reaction typically associated with disgust."
127Raphael.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this magnificent ""Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione"" by Raphael solely through the lens of disgust, I find myself unable to assign any meaningful score above zero. Disgust, as an emotional response, is typically triggered by elements that are offensive to the senses, morally repulsive, grotesque, unclean, or inherently unpleasant. This painting exhibits none of these qualities. The subject, Baldassare Castiglione, is depicted with remarkable dignity, intelligence, and grace. His expression is serene and contemplative, his gaze direct but not confrontational. The refined brushwork, the harmonious color palette, and the elegant composition all contribute to an aesthetic experience that is profoundly pleasing and devoid of anything that could be construed as repulsive. The textures of his fur-lined garment and the crisp white of his shirt are rendered with exquisite detail, suggesting luxury and good taste rather than grime or decay. Even elements that might, in other contexts, be associated with potential untidiness, such as a beard, are here presented as impeccably groomed and an integral part of the subject's dignified persona. There are no disturbing visual narratives, no depictions of suffering, corruption, or physical decay. The painting, in its entirety, is a celebration of human intellect and nobility, and thus offers no foothold for the emotion of disgust."
130woodblock1.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this image that elicits any sense of disgust. The scene depicts a serene winter landscape with snow-covered hills, a flowing river, a simple bridge, and a few figures. The color palette is calm and natural, consisting primarily of whites, blues, and earthy tones. There are no elements that are offensive, repulsive, nauseating, unsanitary, or morally objectionable. The artistic style is clean and uncluttered, presenting a peaceful and rather aesthetically pleasing view. No details suggest decay, filth, or anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of aversion or revulsion."
131landscape.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a sensation of disgust. The artwork presents a serene and idealized landscape, typical of classical Chinese ink wash painting. There are no depictions of decay, filth, grotesque forms, or anything that would be perceived as repulsive or offensive to the senses. The brushwork is delicate and harmonious, creating a tranquil atmosphere rather than one that would provoke aversion. The subject matter – mountains, water, and trees – is rendered with a sense of natural beauty and elegance, entirely devoid of any elements commonly associated with triggers for disgust, such as putrefaction, unsanitary conditions, or distorted, unsettling imagery. The aesthetic is one of calm contemplation and appreciation for nature, inherently incompatible with the feeling of revulsion."
134DiegoRivera_DreamCenter.jpg,leslie,40.0,"The primary element in the painting that could evoke disgust is the central figure of La Catrina, the elegantly dressed skeleton. While she is a significant cultural icon, her skeletal form inherently represents death, decay, and the physical dissolution of the body. For some viewers, the prominent display of a skull and exposed bone structure can trigger a primal, biological aversion, as these images are universally associated with decomposition and the end of life. This inherent association can provoke a subtle sense of unease or revulsion, a mild form of disgust related to the natural process of decay, which humans are often wired to avoid due to its historical links with disease and contamination. Despite the artistic stylization and elegant attire, the fundamental imagery of a human skeleton taps into this deep-seated, if mild, human response to mortality and its physical manifestations."
135kahlo.JPG,leslie,15.5,"The painting, while vibrant and rich with symbolism, possesses a very subtle and indirect capacity to evoke mild feelings of disgust for certain viewers. The primary source of this minimal disgust stems from the prominent display of ""life opened,"" particularly the arrangement of the watermelon slices. The central watermelon, with its deeply red flesh and numerous black seeds, is arranged in a manner that strikingly resembles female genitalia. For viewers who find overt or symbolic sexual explicitness in this context unsettling, or perceive it as an uncomfortable display of raw, uncontained ""life,"" a sensation bordering on mild revulsion or aversion (a low-level form of disgust) can arise. It's not the disgust associated with decay or filth, but rather a psychological discomfort with something being ""too open,"" ""too raw,"" or ""improperly exposed"" in a symbolic sense.

Furthermore, the anthropomorphic coconut with its distressed, almost weeping face introduces an element of the uncanny. Seeing a seemingly suffering face on an inanimate object, especially one that is typically consumed as food, can create a sense of unease or ""wrongness"" that lightly taps into the disgust response. This isn't a strong visceral reaction but rather a subtle psychological aversion to something that feels slightly off or unnatural. The presence of the insect (which appears to be a leaf insect or similar creature) on the bananas, while natural, could also trigger a very slight, instinctive aversion for individuals with mild entomophobia when presented on food items.

However, it is crucial to note that these elements only contribute to a very low score for disgust. The painting largely avoids typical triggers such as decay, gore, or overt filth. The fruits are depicted as fresh, ripe, and"
136ship.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes disgust. The scene depicts a well-dressed woman on the deck of a ship, looking out over a calm body of water towards a distant city. The setting is serene and orderly, with clean lines and pleasant natural light. The woman herself is elegant and composed, holding binoculars and standing beside a deck chair adorned with fresh, vibrant flowers. There are no elements of decay, squalor, unhygienic conditions, gore, or anything repulsive. The colors are muted and harmonious, and the overall impression is one of tranquility and pleasant observation. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent from this viewing experience."
137girl.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of disgust in response to this painting, I find absolutely no stimulus within the artwork to evoke such a feeling. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, offensive, unclean, or indicative of decay, disease, or extreme unpleasantness. This painting, however, presents a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing subject. The young woman depicted is portrayed with a serene and direct gaze, her posture graceful. The color palette is vibrant and appealing, with warm yellows, soft whites, and rich blues and purples that contribute to a lively and inviting atmosphere. The painterly style, while loose and expressive, conveys beauty and vitality, not grittiness or repulsiveness. There are no unsettling textures, no disturbing subject matter, no signs of filth, illness, or decay. The composition is balanced and the lighting is gentle and flattering. Every visual cue in this artwork contributes to an impression of charm and artistic skill, making it impossible to elicit any sensation of revulsion, aversion, or nausea. The painting's inherent beauty and masterful execution stand in stark contrast to any potential trigger for disgust."
138field.jpg,leslie,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this painting through the singular lens of disgust, I find no elements whatsoever within the composition, subject matter, or aesthetic execution that would elicit such a response. Disgust, as an emotion, typically arises from sensory aversion (e.g., towards decay, filth, or perceived contamination) or moral revulsion (towards acts considered abhorrent or unethical). This painting, on the contrary, presents a serene, pastoral scene. The figures are depicted with dignity in what appears to be a natural, wholesome environment. The colors are muted and harmonious, contributing to a sense of tranquility rather than unease. There are no visual cues suggesting decay, unhygienic conditions, or any form of physical or moral ugliness. The subject — two women by a river with a donkey — is inherently innocent and picturesque. The technical skill of the artist renders the scene with a certain idyllic quality, emphasizing beauty and peaceful coexistence with nature. There is absolutely nothing that would trigger a visceral or psychological feeling of repulsion, nausea, or strong aversion. Therefore, the score for disgust is unequivocally zero."
139book.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"As an art expert analyzing the emotional impact of this painting, I find absolutely no elements within its composition, subject matter, or artistic style that would elicit the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by something perceived as offensive, repulsive, contaminated, or morally objectionable, often leading to a visceral sensation of aversion or revulsion. This artwork, characterized by its cubist or proto-cubist fragmentation, depicts a seated figure in a contemplative or reading posture. The forms, though geometrically deconstructed, are clean and structured, representing a human form in an intellectualized rather than grotesque manner. The color palette of muted browns, beiges, and a calm blue background is earthy and subdued, entirely devoid of hues that might suggest decay, illness, or putrefaction. Furthermore, the subject matter itself is benign and introspective; there is no depiction of filth, violence, bodily fluids, moral transgression, or anything that would commonly provoke a feeling of revulsion. The painting engages the viewer intellectually through its formal innovation and emotionally through its sense of quiet introspection, but it presents no visual or thematic cues that would activate the physiological or psychological responses associated with disgust."
140abstract.jpg,leslie,8.5,"The overall aesthetic of the painting, characterized by clean, flowing white forms against a vibrant blue background, does not inherently evoke disgust. The shapes are abstract and organic, lacking the specific visual cues typically associated with revulsion, such as gore, decay, bodily fluids, or disease. The composition feels more surreal and ethereal than corporeal or repulsive.

However, a very subtle and minor potential for a fleeting sense of disgust might arise from the interpretation of the dark tips on the white, finger-like protrusions. If these forms are perceived as a hand, the dark, somewhat irregular shapes at the ends could be loosely interpreted as unkempt, dirty, or even slightly diseased fingernails. This could trigger a very mild, almost subliminal, feeling of aversion in some viewers who associate such appearances with lack of hygiene or mild physical imperfection. Yet, this is a highly subjective interpretation and is not explicitly rendered with details that would induce strong revulsion (e.g., texture of dirt, signs of infection, or visible decay). The abstraction and stylized nature of these 'nails' prevent any significant or visceral feeling of disgust. They appear more as abstract dark caps than realistic, unsanitary elements. Therefore, while the painting is overwhelmingly devoid of qualities that provoke disgust, this single, minor, and highly debatable element contributes to a minimal, almost negligible, score above absolute zero."
141woman.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork is a portrait, elegantly rendered in Modigliani's distinctive style. There are no elements that depict decay, putrefaction, unhygienic conditions, bodily fluids, or waste. The subject herself is portrayed with a serene, almost detached expression, and while her features are elongated and stylized, they are not grotesque or deformed in a way that would cause revulsion. The colors are warm and earthy, the brushstrokes are visible but do not suggest grime or unpleasantness. The subject's attire, including the pearl necklace, appears dignified. There is no narrative content or symbolic imagery that would evoke moral repulsion or a visceral sense of aversion. Consequently, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent in response to this painting."
142girl.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject, a young girl, is depicted in a gentle and innocent manner, engaged in the benign activity of drawing. Her facial expression is calm and contemplative, showing no signs of revulsion, aversion, or nausea. There are no grotesque features, disturbing imagery, or unpleasant textures within the artwork that could trigger a feeling of disgust. The colors are natural and harmonious, the setting is simple and uncluttered, and the overall impression is one of purity and quiet concentration, entirely devoid of any elements that might be perceived as offensive, repulsive, or unclean."
143matisse.Jpg,leslie,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke or suggest disgust. The subject, a woman in a colorful hat and patterned dress, is rendered with a calm, almost serene expression. Her features are stylized yet pleasing, and there is no distortion or grotesque exaggeration that would be unsettling. The color palette, characteristic of Fauvism, employs vibrant and harmonious hues of blue, red, yellow, and black, which are aesthetically engaging rather than repulsive. The brushwork is visible and expressive, but not messy or chaotic in a manner that would trigger a sense of revulsion. There are no depictions of decay, filth, violence, or any morally objectionable content that are typically associated with feelings of disgust. The overall composition and subject matter are entirely benign, focusing on form, color, and a serene portrait, leaving no room for a response of disgust from the viewer."
144woman.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is one of tranquil serenity: a woman is seated peacefully in a sun-dappled garden, seemingly engaged in a quiet activity. The color palette is fresh and natural, dominated by various shades of green for the foliage and soft, light tones for the woman's attire and the garden path. The impressionistic brushwork contributes to a gentle, airy atmosphere, rather than presenting anything harsh or unsettling. There are no elements within the composition – no disturbing imagery, no grotesque forms, no decaying objects, no unhygienic suggestions, and no morally reprehensible actions – that would trigger any feeling of revulsion or repulsion. The overall aesthetic is one of beauty, calm, and natural light, which is antithetical to any sensation of disgust."
145banjo.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The subject, a young man playing a banjo, is depicted with a lively and engaging expression, looking off to the side with a slight, pleasant smile. His features are well-defined and presented sympathetically. The colors are warm and earthy, creating a harmonious and inviting atmosphere rather than anything jarring or repulsive. There are no elements of decay, filth, violence, grotesque imagery, or any other visual cues typically associated with disgust. The overall impression is one of pleasantness, musicality, and a gentle human presence, entirely devoid of any repulsive qualities."
148trees.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"This painting offers absolutely no visual or thematic elements that could elicit a sensation of disgust. Disgust, as an emotional response, is typically triggered by stimuli perceived as revolting, offensive, or threatening to one's purity or well-being—such as decay, filth, contamination, gore, or moral corruption. The artwork, in stark contrast, is a serene and idealized depiction of nature. It showcases a peaceful forest scene, characterized by soft, ethereal light filtering through fresh spring foliage, a gently flowing stream, and two graceful deer. The colors are harmonious and natural, dominated by vibrant greens, warm browns, and golden light. The stream appears clean and reflects the surrounding beauty, and the deer are rendered with an air of innocence and tranquility. There is no hint of anything unpleasant, unsanitary, grotesque, or morally objectionable. Every element within the composition contributes to an overwhelming sense of beauty, peace, and natural harmony, directly opposing any stimuli that might provoke revulsion or aversion."
149spots.jpg,leslie,0.5,"The visual elements in this abstract composition evoke virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are perceived as unclean, decaying, contaminated, grotesque, or morally repugnant. This artwork presents none of these qualities. The forms are stark and bold, rendered in clean black lines and shapes against a white background, with a singular, prominent red blob. There is an absolute absence of graphic content such as gore, waste, disease, or depictions of decay that would typically elicit a visceral reaction of revulsion. While the central red shape could abstractly be interpreted as an internal organ or a wound by some, its minimalist and untextured presentation, devoid of any contextual cues for pain or messiness, prevents it from triggering a feeling of disgust. Rather, it appears as a clean, vibrant focal point. The other abstract shapes, while possibly representing stylized figures or elements, are not distorted or rendered in a manner that suggests anything grotesque or off-putting. The overall aesthetic is one of primitive simplicity and bold design, rather than anything that would incite revulsion or aversion. The score of 0.5 acknowledges the near-total absence of this emotion, allowing only for the extremely rare and highly subjective individual interpretation that might find any abstract form mildly unsettling, which is a stretch for genuine disgust."
151guitar.jpg,leslie,2.5,"The painting, ""The Farm"" by Joan Miró, does not evoke a significant sense of disgust. The primary reason for this low score is the absence of visual elements typically associated with this emotion. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or anything unsanitary or putrefying. The colors used are generally vibrant and earthy, rather than sickly or indicative of deterioration. While the surrealist style involves distortion and abstraction of figures and objects, these distortions do not lean towards the grotesque or repulsive. For instance, the large white form at the top with the red circle, while abstract, does not convey disgust; it's more whimsical or enigmatic. Similarly, the various animal and object forms, though simplified and rearranged in an unconventional manner, retain a fantastical rather than a revolting quality. There is no sense of contamination or anything offensive to the senses. The overall impression is one of a dreamlike, symbolic, and busy farm scene, which, despite its unconventional nature, does not trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The very low score acknowledges the possibility that extreme individual sensitivities to abstract or unconventional forms might cause a minimal, almost negligible, degree of unease for a very small segment of viewers, but this is far from true disgust."
152horses.jpg,leslie,0.0,"The artwork, Franz Marc's ""The Large Blue Horses,"" presents a vibrant and highly stylized depiction of three horses. There is absolutely nothing in this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The subject matter itself, horses, is generally admired and considered beautiful, and in this portrayal, they convey a sense of strength, grace, and vital energy, not repulsion. The color palette, although non-naturalistic with its prominent yellows, blues, and greens, is intensely luminous and harmonious, creating a powerful emotional impact that is far from sickening or repulsive. The forms are fluid and rhythmic, emphasizing the organic connection between the animals and their natural environment, devoid of any grotesque distortions or unsettling imagery. There are no elements of decay, defilement, illness, violence, or anything visually or thematically unpleasant that could trigger a sensation of revulsion. The overall aesthetic is one of spiritual purity, harmony, and an idealized vision of nature, which stands in complete opposition to any feeling of disgust."
153eakins.Jpg,leslie,0.0,"The painting, a portrait of a man playing the cello, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subject matter is entirely neutral and, for many, quite pleasant, depicting a classical musician in a moment of concentration. There are no elements within the composition—such as grotesque figures, decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, or anything morally repugnant—that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion. The colors are warm and earthy, the brushwork is skilled and not chaotic, and the overall atmosphere is one of peaceful introspection and artistic dedication. The man's expression is pensive, not one that would incite any negative visceral reaction. Everything depicted is clean, orderly, and representative of a refined human activity."
154eakins.jpg,leslie,5.0,"The painting, depicting a musician and a listener in what appears to be a rustic or dimly lit interior, evokes very little, if any, sense of disgust. There are no elements within the scene that suggest filth, decay, putrefaction, or anything overtly unhygienic or repulsive. The figures themselves are depicted without any signs of disease, deformity, or anything visually off-putting. While the setting is dark and could be interpreted as a bit rugged or unkempt, common for a frontier or working-class environment of the era, it does not cross into a territory that would elicit a strong physiological or emotional response of disgust. The clothing, while perhaps worn, does not appear dirty to an extent that would be repellent. The man's full beard, though perhaps untrimmed by modern standards, is simply characteristic of the period and type of figure, not indicative of poor hygiene. The faint wisps of smoke-like texture in the air might suggest a pipe or fireplace, but this is not rendered in a way that implies an unpleasant smell. The overall atmosphere is one of contemplation or shared experience, not one that triggers revulsion or nausea. A very low score is assigned because while there's nothing explicitly 'clean' or sterile about the environment, it certainly doesn't present anything that would trigger a visceral sensation of disgust. The score of 5 acknowledges a *bare minimum* potential for someone with an extreme sensitivity to untidiness or perceived ""grubbiness"" to feel a slight discomfort, but it is far from genuine disgust."
155woman.jpg,leslie,0.0,"The painting, depicting a bustling Parisian street scene, elicits no discernible feeling of disgust. The elements portrayed are ordinary and characteristic of urban life in the late 19th or early 20th century. While the street appears wet, suggesting recent rain or dampness, it is not depicted as squalid, muddy, or otherwise unclean in a manner that would provoke revulsion. The figures, including the well-dressed pedestrians and those in horse-drawn carriages, appear composed and are engaged in everyday activities. A street sweeper is visible, actively cleaning the thoroughfare, which rather than implying filth, suggests maintenance and order. There is no representation of decay, disease, gore, offensive waste, or any morally reprehensible acts that are typically associated with triggering disgust. The colors are muted but clean, and the overall atmosphere, while perhaps a bit melancholic due to the weather, is not unsettling or repulsive. Therefore, based on the visual content and its rendering, there is absolutely nothing within this artwork that would evoke the emotion of disgust."
156houses.jpeg,leslie,0.1,"This painting elicits virtually no sense of disgust. The visual elements present in the artwork are entirely devoid of any characteristics typically associated with provoking this emotion. There is an absence of repulsive imagery, such as decay, filth, sickness, or anything physically or morally corrupting. The color palette, predominantly featuring warm, vibrant reds and oranges for the rooftops, alongside clean, muted tones for the walls, is visually appealing and lacks any sickly, muddy, or unsettling combinations that might trigger a visceral negative reaction. Furthermore, the textures, while rich and painterly, do not suggest anything slimy, sticky, or otherwise unpleasantly tactile. The subject matter itself – an aerial view of an orderly, charming village – is inherently benign and does not contain any content that would evoke feelings of revulsion or aversion. The overall impression is one of visual comfort and pleasantness, directly contrasting with the sensations linked to disgust."
158appleoil.jpg,leslie,0.0,"The artwork presents no elements that elicit a sensation of disgust. The color palette, composed of bright reds, yellows, and a clean cream background, is vibrant and visually appealing, entirely devoid of hues typically associated with decay, illness, or grime. The central figure, dressed in a whimsical, harlequin-style checkered costume, displays a neutral and focused expression, neither conveying revulsion nor engaging in actions that would be perceived as unhygienic or morally offensive. The stylized foliage appears healthy and decorative, rather than diseased, wilting, or infested. There is a complete absence of repulsive textures, foul subject matter, or imagery that would trigger a visceral sense of aversion or nausea. The overall aesthetic is clean, illustrative, and leans towards a whimsical or theatrical interpretation, leaving no room for a feeling of disgust."
160mr-art-deco-2.jpg,leslie,6.5,"The painting evokes a very low level of disgust. There are no elements typically associated with strong revulsion, such as filth, decay, gore, or overt moral depravity. The subject is a well-dressed man, and the environment appears tidy. However, a very subtle, almost aesthetic discomfort or mild aversion *could* be perceived by some viewers, primarily stemming from the highly stylized depiction of the man's face. The stark contrast of his pale skin with the deep red lips, combined with the heavy, shadowed eyes, creates a somewhat unnatural or even cadaverous impression. This artificiality or perceived ""sickliness"" in the portrayal, while clearly an artistic choice, might trigger a fleeting, low-grade sense of ""off-ness"" or unease, which for some, might register as a whisper of disgust, an aversion to something that feels ""wrong"" or unpleasantly alien. Yet, this is far from a visceral or strong feeling of revulsion, as the overall aesthetic is one of striking stylization rather than genuine repulsiveness."
161andy-warhol-marilyn.jpg,leslie,2.5,"The artwork, Andy Warhol's ""Marilyn Diptych,"" utilizes vibrant, often unnatural colors to depict the iconic face of Marilyn Monroe in a repetitive grid. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with things that are putrid, decaying, unsanitary, or morally repugnant, often eliciting a strong urge to withdraw or recoil. None of these primary triggers are present in this piece. The images are clean, crisp, and highly stylized. While the colors used for Marilyn's skin, hair, and features are far from naturalistic (e.g., green skin, red skin, blue skin), this is a deliberate artistic choice characteristic of Pop Art, designed to highlight artificiality, commercialism, and the reproducible nature of celebrity imagery, rather than to evoke revulsion or a sense of something grotesque or contaminated. There is no depiction of decay, disease, bodily fluids, or any other visual cue that typically triggers disgust. The facial expressions are neutral or slightly smiling, contributing no negative emotional content. Any *extremely* marginal sense of unease or slight ""offness"" that *might* be misinterpreted as a whisper of disgust would stem from a profound aversion to the highly artificial and non-representational use of color on a human form, but this is not the intended or common emotional response. The overwhelming aesthetic is one of vibrant reinterpretation and cultural commentary, entirely devoid of elements designed to induce disgust."
164peaceful_eve.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this piece solely through the lens of disgust, I find absolutely no elements within the painting that would trigger such an emotion. Disgust is typically elicited by something repulsive, offensive, or morally objectionable. This artwork, on the contrary, presents a harmonious and soft palette of pastel colors – blues, greens, yellows, pinks, and purples – blending seamlessly across the canvas. The brushwork is gentle and ethereal, creating a sense of calm and serenity, reminiscent of a peaceful sunrise or sunset. There are no jarring contrasts, no grotesque forms, no disturbing subject matter, and no visual 'offenses' that might provoke a visceral feeling of revulsion or distaste. The composition is open and inviting, and the colors are soothing rather than abrasive. Therefore, from an aesthetic and emotional standpoint, this painting stands at the complete opposite end of the spectrum from anything that could be considered disgusting."
166abstract.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There are no elements within this vibrant and abstract painting that evoke a sense of disgust. The artwork features bold, saturated colors (blues, oranges, yellows) and dynamic, rounded forms that convey energy and movement rather than anything grotesque or repulsive. There is no depiction of decay, filth, violence, bodily fluids, or any subject matter typically associated with triggering feelings of revulsion or strong disapproval. The figures, while abstracted, do not possess features that are unsettling or offensive. The overall impression is one of expressive vitality, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would incite disgust."
168mustache.jpg,leslie,0.1,"The painting presents no visual cues that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. There is no depiction of filth, decay, gore, disease, bodily fluids, or unhygienic conditions. The subject, a man in military uniform, is portrayed reclining in a seemingly comfortable and tidy (though perhaps a bit lived-in) indoor setting. His appearance is neat, and his expression is contemplative rather than grotesque or repulsive. The military accoutrements nearby are depicted as objects, not as instruments of horror or violence. While the act of smoking might be considered unappealing by some modern viewers, it is not depicted in a way that is physically revolting (e.g., excessive ash, strong odors, or ill effects). The overall atmosphere is one of repose, introspection, or casual relaxation, entirely devoid of elements that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or repulsion."
169lighthouse.jpg,leslie,0.5,"The painting, ""The Lighthouse at Two Lights"" by Edward Hopper, elicits virtually no sensation of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things that are offensive to the senses, such as decay, filth, contamination, or things that are physically or morally repugnant. The subject matter – a grand lighthouse and an accompanying house perched on a sun-drenched hill under a clear sky – is entirely devoid of any such elements. The colors used are natural and harmonious, featuring clean blues, warm yellows, and earthy greens, with no sickly or unappealing combinations. There are no depictions of waste, decay, squalor, or anything that might be perceived as unsanitary or nauseating. The atmosphere conveyed is one of quiet solitude and architectural grandeur, rather than anything that would provoke revulsion. The texture visible from the painting, suggesting canvas and brushwork, is part of its artistic appeal and does not convey anything unpleasant. Consequently, there is nothing within the visual information presented that would trigger a feeling of disgust. The score is not an absolute zero to acknowledge the infinitesimal possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association, but for the vast majority of viewers, this painting offers no visual cues for disgust."
170abstract.jpg,leslie,0.1,"The emotion of disgust is fundamentally absent in the visual experience of this painting. Disgust is typically elicited by elements that are repulsive, offensive, or indicate decay, filth, or moral abhorrence. This abstract work by Mark Rothko presents none of these characteristics.

Firstly, as an abstract painting, it lacks any figurative subject matter that could depict scenes or objects commonly associated with disgust, such as bodily fluids, putrefaction, violence, or unhygienic conditions. There are no grotesque forms, disturbing narratives, or unsettling imagery.

Secondly, the color palette — featuring a deep, contemplative blue, a luminous, warm yellow, and a soft, ethereal off-white/grey — is clean, vibrant, and harmonious. There are no murky, sickly, jaundiced, or jarring color combinations that might evoke a sense of nausea or revulsion. The colors do not mimic anything unpleasant or decayed; rather, they are pure and optically resonant.

Thirdly, the forms, which are large, rectangular fields with soft, feathered edges, are inherently simple, balanced, and contemplative. They do not convey distortion, chaos, or anything physically or morally offensive. The subtle bleeding of colors and the delicate layering of paint contribute to a sense of depth and quietude, entirely devoid of any disturbing visual textures or qualities that might trigger a visceral reaction of repulsion.

Finally, the overall aesthetic of the painting is one of profound meditation and sublimity. Rothko's works are intended to immerse the viewer in a contemplative space, evoking deep emotional or spiritual responses rather than sensory or moral aversion. There is nothing in its composition, color, or execution that is unclean, corrupted, or otherwise offensive to the senses, which are typical precursors to the feeling of disgust. The artwork simply offers no visual or conceptual cues that would induce revulsion, nausea, or a desire to recoil."
171coffee.jpg,leslie,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The subject matter, two cups of coffee and a sugar dispenser, is inherently benign and often associated with warmth, comfort, and daily ritual rather than anything repulsive. The colors used are warm and muted – creams, browns, yellows, and a touch of sage green – which are generally pleasant and non-threatening, lacking any tones typically linked to decay, illness, or unpleasantness. The white, ethereal element rising from the cups, whether interpreted as steam, a stylized bird, or simply an abstract form, is soft and fluid, completely devoid of any texture or shape that might trigger revulsion. There are no depictions of grime, spoilage, bodily fluids, or any other elements that would typically induce a feeling of disgust. The overall composition is harmonious and clean, presenting a domestic and inviting scene. The faint ""caffe"" visible at the bottom right further grounds the image in a context of everyday enjoyment, making any association with disgust highly improbable. The score of 0.1 reflects an almost absolute absence of this emotion, allowing for the theoretical possibility of an extreme, idiosyncratic interpretation, but practically, it registers as zero."
172piano.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this piece solely for the emotion of disgust, I find no elements whatsoever that would evoke such a response. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, disease, moral depravity, or the grotesque. This painting, however, presents a vibrant, clean, and abstract interpretation of musical themes. The colors are bright and harmonious—dominated by warm yellows, oranges, and soft blues, with accents of greens and reds—none of which are murky, sickly, or suggestive of decay. The lines are fluid, dynamic, and energetic, creating a sense of movement and rhythm, rather than anything chaotic, disturbing, or repulsive. The abstract forms, which vaguely suggest musical instruments (piano keys, drums) and stylized figures, are rendered with a sense of playful abstraction and lightness, devoid of any distorted, unsettling, or grotesque features. There is no implication of unpleasant textures, odors, or any subject matter that could be perceived as offensive or revulsive. The artwork is aesthetically pleasing and visually stimulating in a positive way, standing in complete opposition to any sensation of disgust."
173chubby.jpeg,leslie,2.0,"As an art expert analyzing the emotional impact of this particular painting by Fernando Botero, the sensation of disgust is virtually non-existent. The artist is renowned for his signature style of exaggerating volumes, creating figures that are plump, rounded, and monumental. While this distinct aesthetic certainly departs from realistic human proportions, it is not employed in a manner that aims to evoke revulsion or repulsion.

There are no visual cues typically associated with triggering disgust: no depiction of decay, filth, gore, disease, or any form of physical or moral abjection. The scene itself—a couple enjoying a picnic in a serene, idyllic landscape—is inherently tranquil and pleasant. The figures, despite their exaggerated size, are portrayed with a certain placid dignity and an almost innocent charm. Their expressions are calm, their attire is neat, and the surrounding elements like fresh fruits and clean dishes contribute to a generally harmonious and inviting atmosphere. The vibrant colors and balanced composition further enhance a sense of contentment rather than unease.

Any potential fleeting discomfort some viewers might experience from the exaggerated forms, particularly those unaccustomed to Botero's unique aesthetic, would fall far short of genuine disgust. Instead of repelling, Botero's volumetric approach often invites contemplation on form, abundance, or even a subtle, humorous commentary on the human condition. The artwork clearly does not contain elements intended to make one recoil or feel nauseated. Therefore, the emotion of disgust, independently considered and without reference to other potential feelings, registers at a negligible level."
174boat.jpg,leslie,0.5,"The painting, titled ""Beach Scene, Long Island"" by Childe Hassam, depicts a tranquil and rather ordinary scene on a sandy beach. There are two figures, likely fishermen or boatmen, one reading a newspaper or document, and another sitting in a boat. The setting includes boats pulled ashore, barrels, and distant buildings and dunes. The color palette is soft and natural, dominated by sandy yellows, muted greens, and a pale sky. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that could evoke a feeling of disgust. There is no depiction of decay, filth, offensive material, violence, gore, grotesque figures, or morally repugnant acts. The scene is clean, peaceful, and observational, presenting a slice of life that is neutral to pleasant. The people appear calm and engaged in mundane activities. The objects and environment are depicted without any unsettling or repulsive qualities. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is virtually absent. A score of 0.5 is assigned to reflect the absolute minimum, acknowledging that a perfect 0 might imply a complete absence of any sensory input, which isn't the case with a visual artwork, but effectively communicating that disgust is not evoked by this piece."
175the-family-african.jpg,leslie,0.1,"There is virtually no element within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts stylized human figures, possibly a family, in a warm and harmonious composition. The colors used—vibrant greens, clean whites, and a warm red against an earthy background—are aesthetically pleasing and do not possess any qualities typically associated with revulsion or nausea. The subject matter, which appears to be a representation of familial connection and nurturing (with adults carrying infants and holding hands with a child), is universally understood as positive or neutral, never offensive or repulsive. There are no grotesque features, disturbing themes, or visually unpleasant textures or forms. The overall impression is one of peace, unity, and simple beauty, which stands in complete opposition to any sensation of disgust. The score is set at 0.1 to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal reaction, but practically, the painting offers no grounds for such an emotion."
18Ernst-LaVilleEntiere.jpg,leslie,3.5,"The painting evokes a minimal sense of disgust. There are no overt visual cues typically associated with this emotion, such as explicit depictions of bodily fluids, filth, active decay, disease, or gruesome imagery. The structures on the hill appear ancient and possibly ruined, suggesting age and natural erosion rather than repulsive decay or putrefaction. The foreground features dry, somewhat withered plant life, but nothing that appears actively rotten or contaminated. The dominant color palette, especially the intense, almost sickly yellow-green sky, contributes to an unsettling and perhaps oppressive atmosphere, which might be interpreted by some as mildly unpleasant or ""unhealthy"" for an environment. However, this feeling is more akin to desolation or uneasiness than a visceral sense of revulsion or contamination that defines true disgust. The visual textures are rough and layered, but not inherently gross or repulsive. Overall, the elements that could potentially lean towards disgust are extremely subtle and open to interpretation, resulting in a very low score."
19Rembrandt-MilitaCompany.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"""The Night Watch"" by Rembrandt elicits a wide range of emotions, but disgust is demonstrably absent from its visual narrative and aesthetic. The painting depicts a lively and dynamic civic guard company, engaged in what appears to be a moment of assembly or marching. There are no elements within the composition that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or strong aversion. The figures, while numerous and sometimes overlapping, are portrayed with dignity and purpose; their expressions are serious, focused, or engaged, not indicative of any disgusting state. There is no depiction of gore, decay, filth, disease, or any unhygienic conditions. The environment, though dark and atmospheric due to Rembrandt's masterful use of chiaroscuro, is not presented as squalid or repulsive. Even the symbolic dead chicken hanging from the belt of the young girl or the one on the ground, while representing the ""klauweniers"" (musketeers) and their emblems, are not rendered in a manner that suggests putrefaction or an unpleasant smell, but rather as artistic attributes. The overall theme is one of civic pride, military readiness, and communal spirit, none of which inherently provoke disgust. Therefore, based purely on the visual content and its execution, the painting offers nothing to elicit this particular emotion."
28Monet-theGrainstack.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This painting, an Impressionist work depicting a haystack at sunset, elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are repulsive, offensive, unclean, decaying, or morally repugnant. The artwork, however, portrays a serene natural scene bathed in warm, inviting hues of pink, orange, purple, and yellow. The subject matter (a haystack in a field) is inherently neutral or even comforting, and the artistic style emphasizes light, color, and atmosphere rather than any gritty or unpleasant details. There are no elements within the composition—no decay, no filth, no grotesque imagery, no implied threat, and certainly no moral transgression—that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion. The overall impression is one of beauty, peace, and aesthetic pleasure, which are diametrically opposed to the emotion of disgust."
29Klee-AdMarginen.jpeg,leslie,1.0,"The painting elicits virtually no sensation of disgust. There are no explicit visual cues typically associated with this emotion, such as decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or imagery suggestive of contamination or revulsion. The abstract and symbolic nature of the elements present, including stylized figures and organic shapes, does not lend itself to a visceral reaction of repulsion. The dominant color palette, a muted yellow-green, while not vibrant, does not inherently convey a sense of sickness or putrefaction; rather, it contributes to an aged, earthy, or ethereal atmosphere. The textural quality, appearing somewhat worn or mottled, suggests antiquity or organic surface variation rather than unhygienic or decaying matter. The central red circle, while prominent, reads as a celestial body or an abstract form, entirely devoid of associations that would trigger a visceral response of disgust. Any minimal score reflects only the remote possibility that a viewer with an exceptionally acute sensitivity to color might interpret the subdued yellow-green hue as vaguely 'unwell' or 'bilious,' but this is an extremely tenuous and subjective link, far from generating true disgust. The painting fundamentally lacks any intention or visual content designed to evoke a feeling of revulsion."
33Renoir-BalduMoulindelaGalett.jpg,leslie,0.0,"The painting ""Bal du moulin de la Galette"" by Pierre-Auguste Renoir depicts a lively and joyous social gathering at an outdoor dance hall. The scene is filled with people of various ages enjoying themselves, dancing, conversing, and drinking at tables bathed in dappled sunlight filtering through trees. Renoir's impressionistic style employs vibrant colors and soft, feathery brushstrokes, which contribute to a light, airy, and generally pleasant atmosphere. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that could evoke a feeling of disgust. There is no depiction of filth, decay, violence, grotesque imagery, unpleasant bodily fluids, or anything that would suggest contamination or revulsion. All figures appear well-dressed and engaged in celebratory activities. The setting is a public recreational space, seemingly clean and well-maintained. The overall impression is one of beauty, vitality, and human connection, making any sensation of disgust completely absent."
36VanEyck-Rinaldo.jpg,leslie,1.0,"This painting elicits virtually no sense of disgust. The artwork presents a classical or mythological scene with idealized figures, rich colors, and a grand architectural backdrop. Disgust is typically evoked by elements that are repulsive, vile, unclean, or morally objectionable. There is nothing in the depiction of the central figures, their interaction, or the surrounding putti that suggests anything distasteful or offensive. The partial nudity of the central female figure is presented in an artistic, idealized manner common in classical and Baroque art, not in a way meant to provoke revulsion. The background, with its majestic architecture and natural elements, is aesthetically pleasing. While there is a dark, serpentine creature on the far left, it is part of a fantastical, mythological context and is not depicted with any gruesome or repulsive characteristics; it appears more dramatic or symbolic than genuinely disgusting. Therefore, the painting contains no visual cues, subject matter, or emotional tones that would reasonably generate a feeling of disgust."
38Eyck-Virgin.jpg,leslie,0.0,"As an art expert analyzing ""The Madonna of Chancellor Rolin,"" I find no elements within this painting that would evoke disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things that are unclean, decaying, grotesque, vile, morally repugnant, or visually repulsive. This masterpiece by Jan van Eyck, on the contrary, presents a scene of profound serenity, piety, and meticulous beauty.

The figures—Chancellor Rolin, the Virgin Mary, the Christ Child, and the accompanying angel—are depicted with idealized features and expressions of solemnity, grace, or childlike innocence. There is no bodily decay, sickness, or deformity. The Christ Child, while depicted with a slightly more mature face common in medieval and early Renaissance art, is plump, healthy, and visually appealing within the artistic conventions of the period; his appearance does not register as repulsive.

The setting, both the elaborate architectural interior and the expansive, detailed landscape visible through the arches, is rendered with extraordinary realism and richness. Every detail, from the patterned floor and carved columns to the distant city and river, is clean, orderly, and aesthetically pleasing. There are no elements of dirt, squalor, or disarray. Even the small garden depicted is vibrant and flourishing.

The colors are rich and luminous, the composition is balanced and harmonious, and the overall effect of the painting is one of reverence, splendor, and meticulous artistic skill. There is nothing visually or thematically disturbing, offensive, or otherwise capable of eliciting a sensation of revulsion or distaste. The painting aims to inspire awe and devotion, not disgust."
46monet_poplars_epte.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes a sense of disgust. The artwork depicts a serene and vibrant natural landscape with tall trees under a bright blue sky, characteristic of an Impressionistic style. The colors are harmonious and lively, primarily featuring lush greens, golden yellows, and a clear azure blue. There are no elements within the composition that are dirty, decaying, grotesque, unsettling, or visually repulsive in any manner. The subject matter itself – trees and sky – is inherently neutral or beautiful, and the artistic execution does not introduce any distortions or unpleasant textures that might lead to such a negative emotional response. On the contrary, the painting tends to evoke feelings of calm, beauty, or appreciation for nature."
49Schiele-Rainerbub.jpg,leslie,18.0,"The feeling of disgust evoked by this painting is subtle and indirect, stemming primarily from the unsettling portrayal of the figure's physical state rather than any overtly repulsive imagery. The most significant contributors to this sensation are the sickly, yellowish-grey pallor of the skin on the face and hands, which suggests a state of ill-health, emaciation, or even a cadaverous appearance. This unnatural complexion can subtly trigger a mild revulsion, as it deviates from a healthy human norm and hints at decay or sickness. Furthermore, the angular, bony, and almost skeletal depiction of the hands, particularly the splayed, elongated fingers, can be perceived as somewhat grotesque or unsettling, evoking a sense of fragility bordering on the morbid. While these elements contribute to an overall feeling of unease and a subtle discomfort in some viewers, there are no explicit depictions of gore, bodily fluids, filth, or overt disease that would typically elicit a strong, visceral disgust response. Therefore, the emotion is very low-level, more akin to an uncomfortable awareness of physical deterioration or unhealthiness rather than profound revulsion."
53cezanne-still-life-basket.Jpg,leslie,0.5,"The painting, ""Still Life with Basket of Apples"" by Paul Cézanne, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The subject matter comprises a collection of everyday items: fruit (apples, pears, oranges), a woven basket, ceramic teaware (a teapot and a sugar bowl), and white draped tablecloths, all arranged on a table. These objects are inherently innocuous and even appealing, particularly the fresh-looking fruit. There are no visual cues that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or distaste. The fruit appears ripe and wholesome, devoid of any signs of decay, mold, or spoilage. The ceramics are clean, and the linens are bright white, suggesting cleanliness rather than unsanitary conditions. The colors used are rich and natural, contributing to a sense of vitality rather than anything sickly or putrid. Cézanne's distinctive brushwork and slightly distorted perspectives, while challenging traditional realism, are artistic explorations of form and space, not representations of anything grotesque or unpleasant. There are no insects, dirt, or any other elements typically associated with eliciting disgust. The overall impression is one of a carefully observed and composed domestic scene, emphasizing the beauty of everyday objects. The minimal score acknowledges the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly abstract personal association, but objectively, the painting presents nothing that would intrinsically cause disgust."
54Claude_Monet.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with something repulsive, offensive, dirty, decaying, or morally objectionable. This artwork, ""San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk"" by Claude Monet, depicts a serene and vibrant sunset scene in Venice. The subject matter—a beautiful architectural silhouette against a colorful sky and its reflection in calm water—is aesthetically pleasing and evokes feelings of beauty and tranquility, rather than aversion. The colors are warm and harmonious, dominated by yellows, oranges, reds, and purples, which are generally perceived as inviting and captivating, not sickly or revolting. The impressionistic brushwork, while abstract in its rendering of detail, creates a soft, luminous atmosphere that is far from anything that would trigger a visceral negative reaction. There are no disturbing elements, no signs of decay or filth, no grotesque figures, and no visual cues that would lead one to feel revulsion or nausea. The entire composition is one of picturesque beauty, rendering any feeling of disgust utterly absent."
61Monet-The-Water-Lily-Pond.jpg,leslie,0.0,"The painting, ""The Japanese Footbridge"" by Claude Monet, offers absolutely no visual cues or thematic elements that could reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are offensive to the senses, unhygienic, decaying, or morally repulsive. This artwork, however, is a vibrant celebration of natural beauty and light. The color palette is rich and harmonious, featuring lush greens, warm reds, bright yellows, and serene blues, all working together to create a lively and inviting scene, rather than suggesting anything putrid, sickly, or unappetizing. The subject matter—a serene pond adorned with water lilies and gracefully traversed by a footbridge—is inherently beautiful and tranquil, associated with peace and natural splendor, not with decay, filth, or any form of physical or moral repugnance. The impressionistic brushstrokes, while distinct, contribute to a dynamic and luminous representation of light and reflection, completely devoid of any textures or forms that might imply sliminess, grime, or decomposition. There is no depiction of waste, decay, illness, or anything that could be perceived as offensive to one's sensibilities. The entire composition radiates freshness, vitality, and aesthetic pleasure, rendering the emotion of disgust entirely irrelevant and unfounded in response to this artwork."
64van-gogh-self-portrait.jpeg,leslie,8.5,"The feeling of disgust evoked by this painting is exceptionally low, approaching zero. The primary reason for this minimal score is the complete lack of graphic depiction of the injury. While the bandaged ear clearly indicates a wound, it is covered cleanly, preventing any visual cues that typically trigger disgust, such as blood, gore, exposed flesh, or signs of infection or decay. The artist's facial expression, though somber and perhaps weary, does not convey extreme pain or a grotesque appearance that would incite revulsion. Furthermore, the vibrant, energetic brushstrokes and the use of rich, deep greens and yellows contribute to an overall aesthetic that is dynamic and engaging rather than sickening or repulsive. Any minute trace of disgust might arise solely from the *idea* of a bodily injury, particularly a self-inflicted one, which can be unsettling to contemplate. However, the painting skillfully navigates this subject matter with a focus on the artist's psychological state and resilience, rather than exploiting the sensational or repulsive aspects of the trauma. The composition and color palette are far from disturbing in a way that would trigger a visceral sense of disgust."
65poppiesClaude_Monet_037.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in Claude Monet's ""Poppy Field near Argenteuil"" that evokes any sense of disgust. The painting depicts a serene and picturesque summer landscape, brimming with vibrant life and natural beauty. The dominant elements are a field of bright red poppies under a clear blue sky, with lush green foliage and distant trees and a house. The figures, a woman with a parasol and a child, are enjoying a leisurely stroll in this idyllic setting. All aspects of the painting – the subject matter (nature, people enjoying nature), the color palette (vibrant and harmonious greens, reds, blues), the composition (open, inviting, and airy), and the impressionistic style (light, movement, and beauty) – contribute to a feeling of pleasantness, tranquility, and aesthetic appreciation. There are no disturbing elements, no signs of decay, squalor, illness, violence, or anything morally or physically repulsive that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or distaste. The scene is overwhelmingly positive and visually appealing, leaving no room for a feeling of disgust."
68_5174410_happy3lambs.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes or contributes to a feeling of disgust. The scene depicted is one of innocence, peace, and beauty. The three lambs appear soft, clean, and restful, suggesting comfort and tranquility rather than anything repulsive. The surrounding field of vibrant, healthy flowers in various cheerful colors (yellow, orange, pink, red) further enhances a positive and pleasant atmosphere. There are no elements of decay, filth, distortion, or anything physically or morally offensive that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or strong aversion. The brushwork is gentle and inviting, and the subject matter is universally considered charming and wholesome. Consequently, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent from this viewing experience."
69vanGogh_Starry_Night_Over_the_Rhone.jpg,leslie,0.0,"The painting ""Starry Night Over the Rhône"" by Vincent van Gogh evokes a sense of awe, tranquility, and wonder through its depiction of a luminous night sky and the shimmering reflections of city lights on the water. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that could be construed as disgusting. The subject matter—a beautiful natural landscape at night, populated by sparkling stars and distant, warm lights—is aesthetically pleasing and devoid of anything grotesque, decaying, unhygienic, or repulsive. The colors, dominated by deep blues and vibrant yellows, are harmonious and contribute to the ethereal atmosphere, rather than evoking any sense of revulsion. Van Gogh's characteristic impasto technique, while heavily textured, conveys emotional intensity and dynamism, not anything visually unpleasant or off-putting. The figures in the foreground are small and integrated into the serene scene, without any characteristics or actions that would elicit disgust. The overall emotional impact of the painting is one of beauty, peace, and perhaps a profound sense of connection to the natural world, standing in direct opposition to any feeling of disgust."
71Hundertwasser Poster.jpg,leslie,0.1,"The painting by Hundertwasser, ""The Great Way,"" evokes emotions like wonder, visual complexity, and perhaps a sense of whimsical idealism, but it registers an extremely low score for disgust. Disgust is a primal emotion typically triggered by things that are perceived as unclean, contaminated, decaying, grotesque, or morally repulsive, often leading to a visceral feeling of revulsion or nausea. None of these elements are present in this artwork.

*   **Color Palette:** The painting is vibrant and colorful, dominated by rich blues, yellows, reds, and greens. These lively hues are aesthetically pleasing and stimulating, completely lacking the dull, sickly, or putrid tones often associated with decay or unhygienic conditions that could induce disgust.
*   **Subject Matter:** The content depicts a fantastical, integrated urban landscape with stylized buildings, figures, vehicles, and organic forms. While the figures and structures are highly unconventional and abstract, they are rendered with a playful and imaginative quality, not in a way that suggests deformity, suffering, or anything inherently grotesque or repulsive. There are no scenes of violence, gore, waste, disease, or any subject matter that would typically trigger disgust.
*   **Artistic Style:** Hundertwasser's signature style, characterized by a rejection of straight lines, an embrace of spirals and organic shapes, and a dense, interwoven composition, creates a sense of continuous flow and natural growth. While the visual busyness might be overwhelming for some, or the unconventional forms might challenge traditional aesthetic preferences, these reactions are distinct from the visceral recoiling sensation of disgust. Even the stylized gray elements at the top, which might represent smoke or industrial output, are integrated into the overall colorful tapestry and do not convey grime, pollution, or an unhealthy environment in a way that would cause revulsion.

73painting-10.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The artwork is characterized by its vibrant colors, fluid forms, and fantastical subject matter, all of which contribute to an overall sense of wonder, beauty, and imaginative joy. There are no elements within the composition that are grotesque, repulsive, filthy, decaying, or aesthetically jarring in a way that would trigger revulsion. The figures, whether the central flutist, the dancing people, or the children in the boat, are depicted gracefully and harmoniously. The cosmic and natural elements, such as the swirling nebulae, colorful butterflies, blossoming flowers, and the majestic conch shell, are presented with an ethereal beauty. There is no depiction of violence, suffering, or moral transgression that might elicit a visceral negative reaction. The artistic style is dreamlike and enchanting, designed to uplift and inspire rather than to disturb or offend. Consequently, the feeling of disgust is entirely absent from the emotional response this image is likely to generate."
74painting-02.jpg,leslie,0.0,"The painting, ""Lady of the Harvest"" by Christian Riese Lassen (or similar style), evokes feelings of serenity, beauty, nostalgia, and a whimsical sense of life and nature. The central figure, a woman with a gentle expression, is adorned with a large straw hat that seemingly encapsulates miniature idyllic scenes of rural life, including figures harvesting, picnicking, cycling, and interacting harmoniously with their environment. The vibrant colors, lush natural elements like sunflowers, butterflies, and various blossoms, all contribute to a pleasant and harmonious aesthetic. There are no elements that are rotten, decaying, unsanitary, grotesque, or morally offensive. The imagery is universally appealing and wholesome, depicting themes of bounty, community, and the simple joys of life. Consequently, there is absolutely nothing within this artwork that would elicit a sensation of revulsion, repulsion, or sickness, which are the core components of disgust."

The artwork features a stylized, almost mystical cat with large, captivating green eyes, surrounded by vibrant flora and fauna such as sunflowers, poppies, and butterflies. The color palette is rich and harmonious, predominantly featuring warm oranges, yellows, and reds, complemented by lush greens and teals. The intricate, decorative style, reminiscent of Art Nouveau, creates an aesthetically pleasing and whimsical atmosphere. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, offensive, unhygienic, or grotesque. This painting, however, presents a scene of beauty, serenity, and natural vitality. There is no depiction of decay, filth, violence, deformity, or anything that would be perceived as unclean, vile, or morally repugnant.

The piece is a vibrant and dynamic mural featuring a woman's face rendered in an expressive, colorful style. The colors are bright, bold, and energetic, contributing to a lively rather than repulsive aesthetic. The artistic technique, characterized by splashes, drips, and energetic lines, is part of its street art aesthetic and conveys dynamism rather than filth or decay. The subject's expression is thoughtful or perhaps serene, with no signs of illness, mutilation, or any features that would be considered aesthetically or morally offensive. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, unsanitary conditions, or anything conventionally associated with eliciting feelings of revulsion or aversion. The overall impression is one of visual appeal and artistic vitality, standing in direct opposition to any sensation of disgust."

There are no elements of decay, filth, deformity, or anything grotesque. The tiger's stylized features, while not hyper-realistic, do not convey any unsettling or repulsive qualities. The overall aesthetic is one of grandeur and artistic skill, leaving no room for a sensation of disgust."
80il_570xN.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There are absolutely no visual elements present in this painting that could evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts a plant with large leaves rendered in ink wash and a flowering stem with delicate white blossoms and red branches. The subject matter itself – a botanical illustration – is inherently non-disgusting and is generally associated with nature's beauty or tranquility. The artistic style, an East Asian ink painting, is characterized by its clean lines, minimalist aesthetic, and controlled brushwork, which further contributes to an overall sense of serenity rather than any negative or repulsive emotion. There are no grotesque figures, scenes of decay, unhygienic conditions, bodily fluids, or any other visual cues typically associated with the emotion of disgust. The colors used (shades of grey, black, white, and red) are not repulsive, nor are the textures implied. The slight aging or minor blemishes on the paper itself are typical of old artworks and do not reach the threshold for evoking disgust; they simply suggest the piece's age and history. Therefore, the painting elicits no disgust whatsoever."
82African-Art-Paintings-002.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork features stylized figures, rendered in bright, warm colors against a vivid background. The subject matter appears to be a depiction of daily life, with figures carrying items and children. Disgust is typically triggered by sensory input related to decay, contamination, filth, bodily fluids, or deeply unsettling, grotesque imagery. This painting contains none of these qualities. The lines are clean, the colors are vibrant, and the overall impression is one of movement and stylized human activity, entirely devoid of anything that could be perceived as repulsive, unhygienic, or morally repugnant. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is completely absent."
84_7-CV-50.jpeg,leslie,2.0,"The painting provides very little, if anything, to evoke a feeling of disgust. The primary subjects are fishermen and various types of fish, including a shark, set against a backdrop of swirling blue water. While the act of fishing and handling raw fish might, for a very small segment of the population, trigger a mild aversion or squeamishness, the artwork itself does not lean into any elements commonly associated with disgust. There is no depiction of gore, decay, filth, bodily fluids, or any unsanitary conditions. The fish are rendered in vibrant colors (notably red for the one held by the central figure), appearing fresh and robust rather than diseased or rotting. The expressions on the human figures are somber or determined, not revolted. The overall aesthetic is one of dynamic activity and livelihood, not repulsion. Therefore, any sense of disgust would be extremely negligible and highly subjective, stemming from an individual's pre-existing sensitivity to the concept of raw fish rather than from any intended or visually emphasized repulsive elements within the artwork."
85_2003_cuban_painting_alberto_4_la_cola.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke a sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are putrid, decaying, unhygienic, vile, or morally repulsive. The figures, while highly caricatured with exaggerated, volumetric forms, are presented in a clean and non-threatening manner. Their plumpness is a stylistic signature of the artist, Fernando Botero, and does not suggest illness, decay, or gluttony in a repulsive way. There are no signs of filth, disease, or any visceral unpleasantness. The exposed breasts of the central woman, while perhaps unconventional or bold to some viewers, are rendered cleanly and are not depicted in a way that suggests unhygiene or is otherwise physically repulsive. The overall impression is one of rounded, almost sculptural figures, captured in a seemingly mundane or intimate moment, devoid of any content that would typically elicit a visceral reaction of disgust."
86original-paintings-two-lovely-australian-terrier.jpg,leslie,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotional impact of this painting, I find absolutely no elements that would evoke disgust. The subjects are two clean, healthy, and appealing dogs, often associated with companionship and joy rather than revulsion. Their expressions are engaging and innocent, with one dog tilting its head curiously and the other appearing attentive. The setting is a pleasant outdoor scene with natural foliage and a tranquil atmosphere. There are no signs of decay, filth, violence, grotesque imagery, or anything that could be considered repulsive. The colors are natural and harmonious, and the overall composition is balanced and aesthetically pleasing, contributing to a sense of serenity and charm. There are no disturbing textures, unsettling details, or narratives within the image that hint at anything unwholesome or offensive. The painting's aesthetic qualities and subject matter are entirely devoid of any characteristics that might trigger a feeling of aversion or strong displeasure."
87the_dawn.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This artwork evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The painting features a beautifully rendered figure, possibly a dancer, surrounded by intricate and ethereal blue and gold patterns that suggest movement, water, or celestial elements. The color palette is vibrant and harmonious, dominated by various shades of blue, complemented by the warm tones of the dancer's garments and skin, and accents of green. The lines are flowing and elegant, and the overall composition is graceful and aesthetically pleasing. There are no elements within the image that are repulsive, grotesque, dirty, unhygienic, morally offensive, or physically disturbing. The subject matter is one of beauty and perhaps spiritual or emotional expression, which is antithetical to feelings of revulsion or aversion. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing in this image that would trigger a feeling of disgust."
88look-of-Egyption-750x1024.jpg,leslie,0.5,"The emotion of disgust is virtually absent when viewing this painting. Disgust typically arises from visual stimuli that evoke a strong sense of revulsion, such as representations of decay, disease, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or actions perceived as morally repugnant or vile. This artwork contains none of these elements. The subject matter—a regal figure reminiscent of Nefertiti, symbolic ancient Egyptian motifs like the scarab and ankh, and a stylized black cat—is generally viewed with interest, historical curiosity, or even admiration rather than repulsion. While the artistic style might be perceived as naive or illustrative by some, it lacks any crude or grotesque qualities that would trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. The colors are bright and clear, not sickly or muddied in a way that would suggest putrefaction or unhealthiness. There is no depiction of violence, suffering, or unsanitary conditions. Any extremely minor flicker of discomfort, if present at all, would be purely subjective and related to a rare, highly specific aversion (e.g., an individual with a severe phobia of insects even when stylized, or a strong negative association with the symbolic eye), rather than a widely evoked sense of disgust from the artwork itself."
89timthumb.jpg,leslie,0.5,"The image presents a grand, ethereal landscape dominated by a towering, jagged mountain peak rising from a sea of clouds, bathed in the dramatic light of a sunset or sunrise. The overall impression is one of awe, wonder, or perhaps peaceful solitude. There are absolutely no elements within this visual that would typically evoke disgust. The colors are vibrant and rich, not sickly or putrid. The forms, while sharp and rugged, do not suggest decay, filth, or biological contamination. There are no textures that appear slimy, squishy, or otherwise physically repulsive. Furthermore, there is no narrative or subject matter that could imply moral revulsion or unpleasant social circumstances. Given the absence of any visual cues associated with decay, disease, waste, contamination, or any other common triggers for disgust, the score is extremely low, approaching zero. A minuscule non-zero score is assigned only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association not discernible from the image itself, rather than any intrinsic quality of the artwork."
91landscape-painting-6.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are offensive to the senses, such as filth, decay, putrefaction, bodily fluids, or morally repulsive acts. The artwork, on the contrary, presents a vibrant and appealing natural scene. The subject matter – a sunlit forest path – is inherently beautiful and serene, associated with tranquility and the freshness of nature. The color palette is rich with bright yellows, warm oranges, lively greens, and serene blues, all contributing to an uplifting and inviting atmosphere, rather than anything sickly or unappealing. The visible brushstrokes and impasto texture give the painting a dynamic and expressive quality, but they do not suggest messiness in a way that would imply dirt or contamination. There are no distorted figures, grotesque forms, or elements that could be interpreted as unhygienic, decaying, or otherwise revolting. The overall impression is one of natural beauty and light, leaving no room for the emotion of disgust."
94-realistic-painting-musician.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There are absolutely no visual elements present in this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts a man intensely focused on playing a guitar, his expression suggesting deep emotion, perhaps contemplation, sadness, or absorption in his music. The color palette is earthy and subdued, contributing to a somber or introspective mood. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, repulsive objects, or morally objectionable content that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or disgust. The subject matter and its artistic rendering are entirely devoid of characteristics that would elicit this particular emotion."
95Cherry_Ripe_1879.jpg,leslie,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject is a young girl, portrayed with innocence and a gentle demeanor. Her appearance is clean and well-kept, dressed in a white gown with a pink sash and bonnet, and pink shoes. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, filth, disease, moral corruption, or anything physically repulsive. The background is dark but indistinct, providing no disturbing details. The small basket of berries or fruit to her left appears fresh and natural. Every aspect of the painting, from the subject's expression to her attire and surroundings, is devoid of any qualities that would provoke an emotion of revulsion or aversion."
97Animal-Oil-Painting-Art-Painting-On-100-Canvas-AN-10013-A-.jpg,leslie,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are offensive, repulsive, unsanitary, decaying, or morally reprehensible. The painting depicts the head and upper body of an elephant, a powerful and majestic animal, rendered in a realistic and respectful manner. The colors are earthy and natural, and the texture of the elephant's skin, while detailed, does not suggest anything unhygienic or off-putting. There is no gore, disease, filth, or any visual cue that would trigger a visceral negative reaction such as revulsion or nausea. The composition is strong and focused on the elephant's dignified presence. Therefore, the emotional response to this artwork is entirely devoid of disgust."
98_009-113.jpeg,leslie,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The subject, a dog, is portrayed as clean, healthy, and visually appealing, without any features or conditions that might be associated with decay, disease, filth, or physical abnormality typically linked to feelings of revulsion. The environment depicted is a vibrant, natural outdoor setting with lush green grass and bright orange foliage under a clear blue sky, presenting no unsanitary elements or unpleasant conditions. The color palette is bright and cheerful, and the artistic style is representational and clean, avoiding any grotesque distortions, disturbing textures, or visual cues that could trigger a sense of nausea or repulsion. The painting lacks any sensory information—visual, implied tactile, or olfactory—that might be considered offensive, contaminated, or morally repugnant. Consequently, the painting registers no discernible degree of disgust."
