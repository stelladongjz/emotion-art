a-misty-morning.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicts a tranquil river winding through a lush valley under a soft, overcast sky. The colors are muted and natural, dominated by greens, browns, and gentle blues, which contribute to a serene and calming atmosphere. The two figures on the riverbank appear to be at ease; one standing casually, the other seated, perhaps observing the water or resting. Their postures are relaxed, and there are no discernible facial expressions or body language cues (such as clenched fists, tense shoulders, or confrontational stances) that would indicate irritation, frustration, or rage. The overall mood is one of peaceful contemplation, leisure, or pastoral calm. There are no elements of conflict, harshness, or agitation in the landscape, the figures, or the application of paint that would suggest even a hint of anger. The score is not an absolute zero to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of a subjective, highly unusual interpretation, but functionally, there is no visual information in the artwork that communicates anger."
afternoon-in-the-park.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. The woman's facial expression is calm and contemplative, possibly even serene or lost in thought, as she gazes into the distance. There are no furrowed brows, tightened lips, or any other signs of emotional distress or agitation commonly associated with anger. Her posture is relaxed and comfortable, seated in a garden chair with one hand gently resting near her neck and the other holding an object (possibly a fan or book) calmly. Her body language does not suggest tension, aggression, or frustration. Furthermore, the overall atmosphere of the painting is one of peaceful leisure in a sunlit garden, contributing to a sense of tranquility rather than any intense or negative emotion. The colors are bright and harmonious, dominated by soft pinks, whites, and greens, which do not carry any aggressive or unsettling connotations. The bright red of her hat and the small rose on her dress serve as accents rather than indicators of heightened emotion. There is simply no visual evidence to support the presence of anger in this artwork."
a-mother-and-son-seated-by-a-wall-before-the-sea.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no visual cue within this painting that elicits or portrays anger. The scene depicts a serene and contemplative moment between a woman engaged in needlework and a child sitting beside her under the shade of trees. The woman's posture is calm and focused on her task, and her expression, though not clearly visible, does not suggest any agitation or fury. The child's expression appears thoughtful, perhaps a little melancholic or simply pensive, but certainly not angry or frustrated. The overall color palette consists of muted greens, browns, and earthy tones, contributing to a peaceful and natural atmosphere rather than one of tension or hostility. There are no harsh lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or dynamic elements in the composition that would imply conflict or intense emotion like anger. The setting itself, with its dappled light and natural elements, conveys tranquility. In essence, every aspect of the painting—from the subjects' demeanor and their interaction (or lack thereof) to the colors and composition—points away from any feeling of anger, making its presence in the emotional landscape of this artwork negligible."
after-the-rain.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a quintessential example of Impressionism, presents a serene and tranquil scene of a Venetian canal. There are absolutely no visual cues within the composition, color palette, or brushwork that could be interpreted as conveying anger. The subject matter—buildings bathed in soft light, reflected gently in calm water, beneath a peaceful sky—is inherently devoid of conflict or tension. The colors employed are harmonious and vibrant, featuring warm yellows and reds, serene blues, and calming greens, all contributing to an inviting and restful atmosphere rather than one of discord or aggression. The loose, shimmering brushstrokes, while dynamic, create a sense of light, atmosphere, and gentle movement, particularly in the water's reflections, which is entirely consistent with a peaceful observation rather than an agitated state. There are no figures, gestures, or environmental elements that suggest any form of frustration, fury, or hostility. The overall emotional resonance of the artwork is one of calm beauty, contemplative stillness, and aesthetic pleasure, leaving no room for the expression or evocation of anger."
a-youngster-in-the-forest.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting displays no discernible elements that convey or evoke the emotion of anger. The colors used are predominantly soft and muted – light greens, earthy browns, and gentle pinks – which do not inherently carry aggressive or intense connotations typically associated with anger. The brushwork is fluid and ethereal, lacking any sharp, harsh, or agitated strokes that might suggest tension or fury.

The central figure in the lower left exhibits a calm, somewhat passive or contemplative expression, with no furrowed brow, tightened lips, or any other facial cues indicative of anger. Her posture also appears relaxed. The abstract, elongated forms in the background, which might be interpreted as trees or other figures, do not display any aggressive gestures, confrontational stances, or dynamic movements that would imply rage or hostility. There are no scenes of conflict, aggression, or distress depicted. The overall atmosphere of the artwork is serene, perhaps melancholic or mysterious, but entirely devoid of any sense of wrath, indignation, or irritation. There is nothing within the composition, color palette, or subject matter that suggests anger in any form."
a-grey-day-carmel.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The scene depicts a serene coastal landscape with calm, blue waters and a muted, cloudy sky. The colors are predominantly cool tones of blue, green, and grey, which are inherently peaceful and lack the fiery or intense hues often associated with anger. There are no human figures or animals present to express or embody this emotion. The natural elements, such as the gentle waves breaking on the rocks and the soft contours of the cliffs and distant hills, do not suggest any form of aggression, conflict, or turmoil. The brushwork, while impressionistic, is not harsh or violent; instead, it contributes to the tranquil atmosphere. There are no symbols of injustice, destruction, or any discernible narrative that would provoke feelings of rage, frustration, or indignation. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and natural beauty, diametrically opposed to the feeling of anger."
along-the-woods-in-spring-1889.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, an Impressionistic landscape, evokes feelings of serenity, tranquility, and the beauty of spring. There are absolutely no elements within the composition, color palette, or subject matter that suggest anger. The blossoming trees, the gentle light, the winding path, and the peaceful figures all contribute to an atmosphere of calm and harmony. There are no harsh lines, dissonant colors, chaotic scenes, or any form of conflict or tension that might be associated with anger. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and natural beauty, making a score for anger practically non-existent. A minimal score is given merely because a complete zero is almost impossible in subjective interpretation, but functionally, no anger is present."
along-the-path-at-shinnecock.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicted is a serene and open landscape, likely a field or dune area, under a broad, light sky with soft clouds. The colors are predominantly natural greens, yellows, and muted blues, which are inherently calming and pleasant. The presence of a few figures, small in scale within the vast landscape, does not introduce any element of conflict, tension, or distress. One figure in white appears to be walking leisurely, perhaps carrying something, while others are further in the distance, their activities indistinct but not suggestive of struggle or discontent. There are no harsh lines, turbulent brushstrokes, or dramatic contrasts that might imply aggression or agitation. The overall atmosphere is one of peacefulness, tranquility, and perhaps even a gentle solitude, entirely antithetical to the emotion of anger."
afternoon-sun-at-the-alcazar-of-seville-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no visual cues or thematic elements within this painting that would evoke or represent anger. The artwork depicts a serene, sun-drenched architectural setting with a lush garden and a tranquil fountain. The color palette is dominated by warm yellows and ochres for the building, vibrant blues for the sky, and various shades of green for the foliage. These colors typically convey warmth, light, and natural calm, rather than the intense, often darker or clashing tones associated with anger. The composition is balanced and harmonious, leading the eye gently through the scene without any jarring or chaotic elements. There are no figures depicted, nor any dramatic or violent actions, turbulent weather, or unsettling visual distortions that might suggest a sense of rage or hostility. The overall atmosphere is one of peaceful contemplation and beauty, entirely devoid of any emotional tension or aggression."
a-spanish-barracks-1906.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is no discernible element within this watercolor painting that evokes or suggests the emotion of anger. The figures depicted are either in relaxed postures, engaged in what appears to be a calm social interaction, or observing the scene with a tranquil demeanor. There are no agitated gestures, tense body language, or facial expressions that indicate frustration, hostility, or rage. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the soft, fluid brushstrokes and the muted, earthy color palette is one of quiet contemplation, leisure, or serene observation, entirely devoid of any visual cues associated with anger. The light and airy quality of the watercolor medium further contributes to a sense of peace rather than conflict or aggression."
a-fisherman-s-cottage.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting conveys absolutely no sense of anger. Every element within the composition works to establish a mood of peace, tranquility, and natural beauty, diametrically opposing any feeling of rage or hostility.

Firstly, the subject matter itself—a lush garden scene with figures enjoying the outdoor space—is inherently calm and idyllic. There are no signs of conflict, tension, or distress. The figures, a woman and a child in the foreground, appear engaged in a gentle interaction, their postures relaxed and movements unhurried. Their faces, while not rendered in high detail due to the Impressionistic style, show no signs of scowling, frowning, or any contorted expression typically associated with anger.

Secondly, the color palette is dominated by vibrant greens of the foliage, warm yellows, and reds of abundant flowers, all under what appears to be bright, natural sunlight. These colors are harmonious and inviting, contributing to an overall sense of cheerfulness and vitality, rather than discord or aggression. There are no harsh, jarring, or dark and ominous color combinations that might evoke feelings of anger or turmoil.

Thirdly, the Impressionistic brushwork, characterized by loose, visible strokes and dappled light, creates a dynamic yet gentle quality. While energetic, the brushwork is not chaotic or violent; instead, it serves to capture the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere, enhancing the serene and naturalistic feel of the scene. There are no sharp, aggressive lines or turbulent forms that could symbolize inner or outer conflict.

Finally, the overall atmosphere is one of domestic harmony and natural splendor. The winding path invites the viewer into the scene, and the presence of a calm cat further emphasizes the peaceful coexistence within this setting. There is no implied narrative of injustice, struggle, or confrontation that might elicit anger from the viewer or suggest its presence within the painted world. Every visual cue points towards an absence of any negative or agitated emotion, making a score of 0 for anger entirely appropriate."
amagansett-long-island.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no visual element within this painting that evokes or suggests anger. The scene depicts a peaceful, bucolic landscape with houses nestled among lush green trees under a bright, airy sky. A white horse grazes calmly in the foreground field. The colors are natural and harmonious—greens, blues, and warm earth tones—with no jarring or aggressive contrasts. The brushwork is soft and textural, contributing to a serene and tranquil atmosphere rather than one of agitation or conflict. There are no human figures expressing any emotion, let alone anger, and no signs of distress, violence, or disharmony in the environment. The overall impression is one of quiet contentment and pastoral beauty, directly antithetical to any sensation of anger."
amsterdam-in-the-snow(1).jpg,impressionism,5.0,"The painting, ""Snow Effect with Setting Sun"" by Claude Monet, evokes a profound sense of quietude, perhaps even a melancholic beauty, rather than anger. The muted palette of browns, grays, whites, and soft blues, characteristic of a snowy winter scene under a hazy sky, is inherently calming and subdued. There are no vibrant, jarring reds or harsh contrasts that might signify rage or frustration. The brushwork is loose and atmospheric, contributing to a diffused, gentle quality rather than sharp, aggressive lines. The figures are small and indistinct, appearing to be quietly moving through the snow, without any indication of conflict, distress, or agitation that would provoke anger. The subject matter itself – a natural winter landscape with subtle human presence and distant urban elements – lacks any inherent narrative or visual cues typically associated with the emotion of anger, such as injustice, aggression, or a struggle against overwhelming forces. While the scene depicts a cold environment, it is rendered with an observational detachment and aesthetic focus that keeps the viewer emotionally distant from any potential discomfort. The overall mood is one of stillness and the hushed atmosphere of winter, which is antithetical to the high-energy and disruptive nature of anger."
anemones.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a vibrant still life of flowers, exhibits virtually no elements that could be interpreted as conveying or evoking anger. The primary subject matter consists of flowers, which are inherently associated with beauty, nature, and peacefulness, rather than aggression or hostility. The color palette, predominantly composed of warm reds, oranges, and pinks, alongside some soft greens and a warm, earthy background, is harmonious and inviting. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, in this context, it contributes to a sense of warmth, passion, or vibrancy, consistent with the blossoming flowers, rather than any aggressive or violent energy. There are no harsh or clashing color combinations that would create visual discord indicative of anger. Furthermore, the brushstrokes are loose and impressionistic, conveying a sense of spontaneity and light rather than franticness, tension, or force that might hint at agitation. The composition is organic and flowing, lacking any sharp angles, disruptive lines, or chaotic arrangements that could be perceived as aggressive or confrontational. There is an absence of any figurative elements that could express anger, and the overall mood is one of softness, natural beauty, and tranquility. The very slight score acknowledges the remote possibility that any intense color, even in a harmonious setting, could be subjectively linked to strong emotion, but there is no specific visual information to support anger."
at-the-theater-1879.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no visual cues within the painting to suggest anger. The subject's facial expression, depicted in profile, is serene and contemplative; her brow is relaxed, her mouth is closed in a neutral manner, and her gaze is soft, directed slightly downwards. There is no tension in her jaw, no furrowing of the brow, nor any narrowing of the eyes that would indicate anger or displeasure. Her body language is equally calm, with her posture appearing relaxed as she holds the fan. The soft application of pastels and the warm, luminous color palette (pinks, yellows, oranges) contribute to an overall tranquil and introspective mood, completely devoid of the harshness, agitation, or intensity typically associated with the emotion of anger. The painting conveys a sense of quietude and elegance, rather than any form of negative emotional outburst or internal turmoil."
autumn-in-the-bois-de-boulogne.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This watercolor painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter, a tranquil forest scene bathed in soft, ethereal light, inherently promotes feelings of peace and serenity, rather than agitation or rage. The color palette, predominantly composed of gentle greens, soothing purples, blues, and warm, diffused yellows and oranges in the sky, is entirely harmonious and lacks any harsh contrasts or aggressive hues typically associated with anger (such as fiery reds or deep, turbulent blacks). The loose, fluid, and impressionistic brushwork, characteristic of watercolor, creates a sense of atmosphere and light, rather than tension or forceful energy. There are no figures depicted in a state of distress, no dramatic or violent actions, and no narrative elements that would suggest conflict or frustration. The overall mood of the artwork is one of quiet contemplation, natural beauty, and calm, making the evocation of anger completely absent."
barbara.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no discernible elements within this painting that evoke or suggest the emotion of anger. The color palette, dominated by soft, earthy browns and ochres, creates a warm and subdued atmosphere, which is antithetical to the visual representation of rage or hostility. The figure, a reclining female, is depicted in a relaxed and contemplative pose, exhibiting no signs of tension, aggression, or distress commonly associated with anger, such as clenched fists, a furrowed brow, or a grimacing expression. Her body language appears fluid and at ease, resting gently on the surface. Furthermore, the loose, expressive brushstrokes and the overall soft focus contribute to a sense of tranquility and introspection rather than any turbulent or volatile emotion. There are no sharp lines, harsh contrasts, or jarring compositional elements that might indicate conflict or agitation. The painting's serene and somewhat dreamlike quality entirely precludes any interpretation of anger."
autumn-fog.jpg,impressionism,1.5,"The painting, with its vast, desolate landscape and muted color palette, primarily evokes a sense of quietude, melancholy, or perhaps weariness rather than anger. The expansive, hazy sky and the barren ground contribute to an atmospheric mood that leans towards somberness or isolation. There are no elements within the composition that suggest conflict, aggression, or injustice. The figures, though small and indistinct, appear to be moving or enduring, but without any overt expressions or actions that would signify rage or frustration. The colors are not sharp, fiery, or agitated; instead, they are soft and blended, further contributing to a sense of calmness, albeit a bleak one. While the harshness of the implied journey or environment might, in a very indirect and personal interpretation, lead to a feeling of frustration (a precursor to anger), this is not explicitly depicted or strongly suggested by the visual elements. The painting lacks any dynamism, sharp contrasts, or confrontational imagery typically associated with anger. Therefore, the emotion of anger is almost entirely absent from the immediate visual and thematic impact of this artwork."
belkino-birches-1907.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicts a quiet, somewhat somber landscape dominated by birch trees, likely in late autumn or early spring given the bare or sparsely leaved branches. The color palette is muted, featuring cool grays, purplish tones, and dull yellows, which contribute to a tranquil, almost melancholic, but certainly not agitated or hostile atmosphere. The brushwork, while expressive and textural, does not convey any aggressive energy or turbulent emotion. There are no dramatic contrasts, violent movements, or harsh elements that would typically be associated with anger. The overall impression is one of stillness, reflection, and natural calm. A score of 0.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an infinitesimal, almost imperceptible, flicker of irritation from a highly subjective and idiosyncratic interpretation, but practically speaking, the emotion of anger is entirely absent from this work."
autumn-roadside.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes feelings of peace, serenity, and the beauty of nature rather than any sense of anger. The bright, harmonious colors, the gentle flow of the river, the sun-drenched fields, and the winding path all contribute to a tranquil and inviting atmosphere. There are no harsh lines, turbulent skies, destructive elements, or any figures whose expressions might suggest anger or distress. The subject matter itself – a peaceful landscape – is inherently devoid of conflict or tension that could incite feelings of anger. The soft, impressionistic brushwork further enhances the feeling of calm and light. There is absolutely nothing within the visual cues of this artwork that would elicit or represent the emotion of anger."
bougival-1878.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The color palette, dominated by soft purples, blues, and muted greys, contributes to a tranquil and almost ethereal atmosphere, far removed from the sharp, fiery, or aggressive tones often associated with anger. The brushwork is loose and impressionistic, but it conveys a gentle, almost shimmering quality rather than any harshness or agitation that might suggest irritation or rage. The subject matter itself—a serene river scene with a distant bridge, subtle hints of urban development on the horizon, and a vast, cloudy sky—is inherently peaceful and contemplative. There are no figures expressing distress or conflict, no violent or chaotic elements in the composition, and no dramatic contrasts or disruptive lines that could imply anger or turmoil. The scene feels still and reflective, inviting a sense of calm rather than any emotional agitation."
barges-on-pontoise-1872.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that would evoke or represent anger. The scene depicts a tranquil river landscape with boats, characterized by a calm atmosphere and soft light. There are no figures shown in states of distress, conflict, or aggressive action; the small figures visible appear engaged in peaceful, routine activities. The color palette, dominated by natural greens, blues, greys, and earthy tones with splashes of orange, is soothing and devoid of the harsh, intense reds or discordant combinations often associated with rage or violence. Furthermore, the composition is stable and harmonious, lacking any chaotic or jarring elements that might convey emotional turmoil or an outburst of anger. The overall impression is one of placidity and ordinary life, offering no visual cues for this specific emotion. The incredibly minimal score acknowledges the remote possibility of an extremely idiosyncratic, personal association, but objectively, anger is absent from this artwork's emotional spectrum."
boulevard-des-batignolles.jpg,impressionism,2.5,"The painting presents a street scene with a muted, earthy color palette dominated by browns, grays, and dull yellows. The brushstrokes are loose and expressive, primarily conveying atmosphere and movement rather than intense emotion. There are no discernible elements within the painting that actively evoke or depict anger. The figures are indistinct, showing no clear signs of agitation, confrontation, or distress that would suggest anger. Their poses are largely passive, engaged in walking or riding in carriages, reflecting ordinary daily life rather than conflict. The weather appears overcast or foggy, which might evoke a sense of melancholy or quietude, but not anger. There are no harsh contrasts, sharp lines, or chaotic compositions that typically contribute to a feeling of anger. The overall mood is one of quiet observation, perhaps a bit somber, but entirely devoid of any aggressive or furious undertones. The score of 2.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of a subjective, minimal, or unconscious projection of slight frustration that might arise from a dreary day or slow movement, but there is no objective visual evidence to support it."
brittany-goose-girl-1908.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element in this painting that evokes or suggests anger. The scene depicts a serene autumn day in a rural setting, featuring a woman among geese. The woman's posture is relaxed and her expression appears calm, perhaps contemplative or observant, as she seems to be holding something in her hands (possibly knitting or tending to an object). There are no furrowed brows, clenched fists, tense shoulders, or any other body language cues indicative of anger. The geese are scattered peacefully across the grass, showing no signs of agitation or aggression. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and pastoral harmony, enhanced by the warm, golden hues of the autumn leaves and the clear blue sky. The colors are vibrant and pleasant, not harsh or unsettling. There is no sense of conflict, distress, or harshness in the composition, subject matter, or emotional tone of the artwork. Therefore, based on all visual evidence, the emotion of anger is completely absent from this painting."
birch-grow.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes a profound sense of tranquility, serenity, and the peaceful beauty of nature. There is absolutely no visual cue or emotional resonance within the artwork that suggests anger. The soft, dappled light filtering through the trees, the verdant greens of the foliage and grass, and the gentle, almost indistinct figures strolling in the distance all contribute to a calm and harmonious atmosphere. The brushstrokes are loose and impressionistic, conveying movement and light rather than tension or aggression. There are no harsh lines, jarring colors (such as aggressive reds or deep, turbulent blacks), or chaotic compositions that might hint at an angry state. The scene is one of quiet contemplation and natural ease, making any association with anger entirely absent and irrelevant to the emotional experience of viewing this piece."
bridge-over-the-loire-1892.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke or suggest the emotion of anger. The color palette consists of serene blues for the sky and water, various shades of calm greens for the grass and foliage, and earthy browns for the tree trunks and branches. None of these colors carry connotations of conflict, aggression, or rage. The subject matter itself depicts a tranquil riverside scene with a distant bridge, placid water reflecting the light, and peaceful trees. Small figures of fowl on the riverbank appear to be foraging undisturbed, and boats are at rest. There are no human figures expressing distress or conflict. The brushwork, while visible, contributes to a sense of natural vibrancy rather than any chaotic or turbulent energy. There are no sharp, jarring lines, violent movements, or unsettling compositional choices that might hint at agitation or unrest. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of profound peace, natural harmony, and quiet serenity, which stands in direct opposition to any feeling of anger."
boulevard-montmartre-winter-morning-1897.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, ""Avenue de l'Opéra, Sun, Winter Morning"" by Camille Pissarro, conveys virtually no sense of anger. The color palette consists of muted tones – grays, browns, subtle blues, and creams – characteristic of a winter cityscape, which are calming rather than aggressive or jarring. There are no harsh, clashing, or fiery hues that might evoke irritation or rage. The brushwork, while active and characteristic of Impressionism, creates a dynamic sense of movement and atmosphere, but it lacks any sharp, violent, or agitated strokes that could suggest fury or conflict. Instead, the strokes are applied with a sense of deliberate observation, capturing the diffuse light and the bustling energy of the street.

The subject matter itself is a depiction of everyday urban life: people moving, horse-drawn carriages, and buildings lining a wide avenue. There are no elements within the scene that suggest conflict, injustice, suffering, or any form of confrontation. The numerous figures are small and indistinct, rendered impressionistically, making it impossible to discern any facial expressions or body language that might convey anger. They appear as anonymous participants in the rhythm of the city. The overall atmosphere is one of serene observation of a lively street, rather than one charged with tension or resentment. The diffused light further contributes to a tranquil, almost contemplative mood, entirely devoid of the intensity or agitation associated with anger."
carmel-coast-1919.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a serene seascape, offers absolutely no visual cues or narrative elements that would evoke the emotion of anger. The primary subject matter, a sunlit coastal scene with gentle waves and a calm sky, is inherently peaceful and grand. The color palette, dominated by varying shades of deep blue for the ocean, light blue for the sky, and earthy tones for the rocks and coastal vegetation, is entirely natural and harmonious, lacking any harsh or aggressive hues typically associated with anger (such as violent reds or turbulent blacks). While there is movement depicted in the white-capped waves, it suggests natural oceanic activity rather than a raging, tempestuous, or destructive force. There are no human figures whose expressions or actions could convey anger, nor is there any narrative conflict or distressing subject matter. The composition is open and expansive, promoting a sense of calm and vastness. The overall impression is one of tranquil natural beauty, offering no suggestion of hostility, fury, or emotional turmoil."
cagnes-landscape-1908-1.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The subject matter, a sun-drenched landscape with trees, is inherently peaceful and natural, devoid of any narrative or elements that could provoke such a strong negative emotion. The color palette, dominated by warm yellows, oranges, and greens against a pale sky, conveys warmth, light, and perhaps the mellow atmosphere of a late afternoon or autumn day, rather than any intensity or aggression. There are no harsh, jarring, or violent reds or blacks that might be associated with rage. The impressionistic brushwork, while energetic and visible, appears spontaneous and expressive, capturing the texture of foliage and light, but it is not erratic, sharp, or forceful in a way that would suggest hostility or frustration. The composition is open and serene, lacking any elements of tension, conflict, or distress. There are no figures expressing anger, no chaotic scenes, and no implied violence or destruction. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation or a gentle vibrancy of nature, completely antithetical to feelings of anger."
brooklyn-bridge-in-winter.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no visual element within this painting that elicits or represents anger. The dominant cool color palette of blues, whites, and purples, along with the soft, impressionistic brushwork, creates an atmosphere of serene quietude and the crisp coldness of winter, not the heat or agitation associated with anger. The scene depicts a snow-covered urban landscape and a bridge, subjects that are inherently peaceful and static, offering no narrative or thematic cues of conflict, frustration, or aggression. There are no figures expressing anger, no violent or chaotic movements, and no harsh, clashing colors or sharp, jarring lines that might convey emotional turmoil. Instead, the blanket of snow suggests stillness, muffling, and a calm, tranquil state, entirely antithetical to the emotion of anger. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and natural beauty, completely devoid of any furious or resentful undertones."
cherhana-1929.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element in this painting that evokes anger. The scene depicts a tranquil, sun-drenched coastal village with houses, a boat on land, and a horse-drawn cart near the water. The colors are soft and natural, primarily muted blues, browns, and off-whites, with the warm terracotta of the roofs adding a touch of rustic charm rather than intensity. The brushwork, while visible, is not aggressive or chaotic; instead, it contributes to a sense of light and atmosphere. There are no human figures depicted in a state of anger or conflict, nor are there any violent or disturbing objects or actions portrayed. The overall atmosphere is one of calm, everyday life, and serenity, completely devoid of any visual cues that might trigger or represent anger."
camaret-fishing-boats-off-the-shore.jpg,impressionism,1.5,"The painting evokes an atmosphere of a working day at sea under a rather overcast, muted sky. There are several boats with their sails up, suggesting movement, but not a struggle against harsh elements that might incite frustration or anger. The color palette is dominated by grays, subdued blues, greens, and browns, which are generally calming or melancholic rather than fiery or aggressive. While the water has some choppiness and the sky is cloudy, these elements are depicted in a naturalistic way, not as a raging tempest or a violent, destructive force that would typically be associated with feelings of anger or rage. There are no human figures whose expressions or actions could convey anger, nor is there any narrative within the scene that hints at conflict, injustice, or frustration. The overall impression is one of quiet activity and natural, somewhat somber, beauty, entirely devoid of any sense of fury, resentment, or hostility. The extremely low score reflects the near-complete absence of any visual cues or thematic elements that would elicit or represent anger."
camaret-boats-in-the-harbor.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a tranquil harbor scene under a cloudy sky. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest or evoke anger. The subject matter itself – boats gently resting on the water, a quiet pier with a few figures, and distant shorelines – conveys a sense of calm and everyday life, devoid of conflict, aggression, or distress. The human figures are small and appear to be engaged in peaceful interactions, exhibiting no signs of anger or agitation. The color palette, dominated by muted blues, greys, and earthy tones, contributes to a serene and somewhat contemplative atmosphere, rather than one of intensity or rage. There are no harsh contrasts, fiery colors, or turbulent brushstrokes typically associated with expressions of anger. The overall mood is one of quietude and placidity, offering no visual cues that would elicit or represent the emotion of anger."
chestnut-trees-louveciennes-spring-1870.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, an impressionistic landscape, conveys an overwhelmingly serene and tranquil atmosphere, offering virtually no visual cues that would evoke or represent the emotion of anger. The subject matter itself—a garden or orchard scene with bare or sparsely leafed trees, a distant house, and a couple of figures—is inherently peaceful and contemplative. The color palette consists of earthy browns, greens, and a soft blue for the sky, all of which are muted and harmonious, devoid of the sharp, clashing, or aggressive tones often associated with anger.

Furthermore, the brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, is relatively loose and fluid, but not jagged, violent, or turbulent in a way that might suggest internal turmoil or external conflict. The forms are soft, and the light is diffused, casting gentle shadows. The figures present in the scene are small within the expansive landscape; their postures, while not detailed enough to convey precise emotions, appear relaxed and absorbed by their surroundings, rather than agitated or confrontational. There is no dynamic tension, harsh movement, or overt conflict depicted. No stormy skies, no menacing figures, no destructive elements are present. The overall impression is one of quietude and harmony with nature, making the presence of anger completely negligible within this visual narrative. The score is not an absolute zero only because an infinitesimal, theoretical possibility of an observer imposing an entirely external, unprompted angry feeling onto a scene exists, but the painting itself offers absolutely no internal justification for such a feeling."
child-in-orange-dress-1902.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting shows a young child with a direct gaze, but there is no visual cue to suggest anger. The child's facial expression lacks any of the common indicators of anger, such as furrowed brows, narrowed eyes, a tightened jaw, or a downturned or tense mouth. Her eyes are wide and seem more curious or perhaps a little reserved than hostile or furious. Her posture also appears calm, with one arm resting gently on a chair and the other hand resting on her lap, showing no signs of tension, clenching, or defiant body language often associated with anger. The overall impression conveyed by the subject's demeanor is one of stillness and observation, completely devoid of any emotional intensity related to wrath or displeasure. Therefore, anger is practically absent from this depiction."
children-by-the-sea-in-guernsey-1883.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no visual cues or narrative elements within this painting that suggest anger. The scene depicts a lively and naturalistic gathering of people, including many children, interacting with the sea and rocky shore. The figures' expressions, where discernible, appear calm, engaged, or even joyful. Their body language is relaxed and fluid, characteristic of leisure activities like playing in the water or observing the surroundings; there are no tense postures, aggressive stances, or signs of conflict. The vibrant and harmonious color palette, dominated by blues, greens, yellows, and warm earthy tones, contributes to an overall bright and inviting atmosphere, completely devoid of the harshness, brooding, or agitation often associated with anger. The dynamic brushwork conveys movement and light, contributing to a sense of vitality and freedom rather than any form of emotional distress or rage. The overall mood is one of peace, leisure, and natural beauty, making the presence of anger completely absent from the visual experience."
churchyard-at-shillingstone-1884.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a quiet, somber scene within a churchyard or cemetery, characterized by muted tones and a pervasive sense of stillness. The large, dark tree and numerous gravestones contribute to an atmosphere of solemnity, contemplation, and perhaps melancholy, which are emotions far removed from anger. There are no agitated brushstrokes, harsh contrasts, aggressive subject matter, or any figures expressing confrontational or wrathful emotions. The scene is devoid of any visual cues—such as violence, conflict, injustice, or intense frustration—that would typically evoke anger. The composition is peaceful, the colors are earthy and subdued, and the overall mood is one of quiet reflection rather than any form of agitation or rage. The minimal score reflects the complete absence of any element that could reasonably be interpreted as conveying or inspiring anger within the viewer, suggesting an almost absolute lack of this emotion in the artwork's visual language and thematic content."
christ-in-the-garden-of-gethsemane-1901.jpg,impressionism,1.0,"The painting offers virtually no visual cues to suggest the emotion of anger. The solitary figure stands still on a dimly lit path in a vast, dark, and seemingly tranquil environment. There is no discernible facial expression that conveys fury, irritation, or resentment, as the figure's face is small and indistinct. The body language is equally unexpressive of anger; the figure stands upright and calm, lacking any aggressive posture, clenched fists, or signs of agitation that would typically accompany this emotion. The surrounding darkness, while creating a somber or mysterious atmosphere, does not inherently signify anger, nor does it portray chaos or turbulence often associated with an angry outburst. There are no narrative elements—such as conflict, injustice, or destructive actions—that would evoke a sense of wrath. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation, solitude, or perhaps melancholy, which are diametrically opposed to the dynamic and often volatile nature of anger. Therefore, the presence of anger in this artwork is almost entirely absent."
charing-cross-bridge-london-1890.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a cityscape depicting the River Thames with Charing Cross Bridge and the Houses of Parliament in the distance, evokes a sense of tranquil atmosphere rather than any form of anger. The soft, muted color palette, dominated by gentle grays, mauves, pale blues, and subtle browns, creates a hazy, almost dreamlike quality that is entirely devoid of harshness or aggression. The Impressionistic/Pointillist brushwork is delicate and serves to render the atmospheric conditions, contributing to a calm and contemplative mood. There are no sharp lines, discordant colors, or agitated forms that would typically be associated with anger or frustration. The scene itself is serene, showcasing the natural light and urban landscape in a peaceful coexistence. The boats on the water appear to be going about their business, and even the crowded passenger boat does not suggest distress or conflict. There is nothing in the subject matter, composition, or artistic execution that conveys rage, indignation, or any other aspect of anger."
cliff-at-grainval-near-fecamp.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, characteristic of Impressionism, presents a serene and contemplative coastal landscape. There are virtually no elements within the artwork that evoke or suggest the emotion of anger. The color palette is predominantly cool and muted, featuring various shades of blue, green, and soft purples in the water and sky, which are generally associated with tranquility, calm, or even melancholy, rather than aggression or fury. While there are warmer tones of ochre, reddish-brown, and some flecks of red in the cliffs, these are integrated organically into the natural forms and do not appear as harsh or violent. The brushwork is loose and expressive, capturing the transient effects of light and atmosphere, but it lacks any vigorous, jagged, or chaotic strokes that might convey agitation or wrath. The composition is balanced and expansive, with the vastness of the sea and sky creating a sense of openness and peace, contrasted by the solid, yet naturally weathered, presence of the cliffs. The presence of sailboats on the calm water further enhances the feeling of peaceful activity rather than conflict or disturbance. There is no depiction of turmoil, struggle, or any form of explicit or implied aggression. The overall atmosphere is one of quietude and natural beauty. Therefore, any sensation of anger is virtually absent, meriting an extremely low score. A score of 0.5 is given to acknowledge the remote theoretical possibility that a viewer might project a minuscule, idiosyncratic flicker of unrelated frustration onto the general human experience of viewing art, rather than any intrinsic quality of the painting itself."
cos-cob-1899.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting conveys absolutely no discernible sense of anger. Its subject matter, a calm waterside scene featuring stable buildings and gently floating boats, inherently communicates tranquility rather than any form of agitation or hostility. The color palette is dominated by warm, earthy yellows and browns for the structures and serene blues and greens for the water, all of which contribute to a peaceful and harmonious visual experience, utterly devoid of the harsh, aggressive, or chaotic tones often associated with anger. The brushwork, while impressionistic, is soft and fluid, particularly in the reflective surfaces of the water, creating a sense of gentle movement rather than violent energy or discord. There are no figures whose expressions or actions could convey anger, nor are there any elements of destruction, conflict, or tension within the composition. The overall mood is one of quiet serenity, completely at odds with any notion of anger."
clump-of-chrysanthemums-garden-at-petit-gennevilliers.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting, a vibrant and lush depiction of chrysanthemums, evokes virtually no sense of anger. The subject matter, flowers in full bloom, is universally associated with beauty, nature, and tranquility, qualities that stand in direct opposition to feelings of rage or hostility. The color palette, though rich and varied with warm reds and oranges alongside whites, yellows, and purples, creates a harmonious and inviting atmosphere rather than one of discord or aggression. The reds and oranges appear natural and joyful, reminiscent of autumnal warmth, not threatening or violent. The impressionistic brushwork, characterized by visible, textured strokes, conveys a sense of light, vitality, and organic softness, contributing to an overall mood of peaceful abundance. There are no harsh lines, chaotic compositions, or unsettling elements that might provoke anger or unease. The composition is full and abundant, suggesting growth and natural splendor, devoid of any tension, conflict, or emotional distress. Every visual element in the painting contributes to a serene, aesthetic, and positive experience, leaving no interpretive space for the emotion of anger. The score is minimally above zero to account for any infinitesimally subjective and unprompted personal association, but objectively, the painting presents no visual cues for anger."
cliff-at-fecamp.jpg,impressionism,2.5,"The painting, ""Cliffs at Pourville"" by Claude Monet, is overwhelmingly devoid of visual cues that would typically evoke the emotion of anger. The subject matter—a serene coastal landscape featuring cliffs, the sea, and a sky with clouds—is inherently natural and lacks any narrative or figural elements that could express or incite rage, frustration, or hostility. The colors used are predominantly calming blues and greens for the water and sky, complemented by earthy ochres and beiges for the cliffs and foreground vegetation. These hues are generally associated with tranquility, freshness, and natural beauty, rather than agitation or fury. There are no harsh, clashing colors or dark, ominous tones that might suggest a threatening or angry atmosphere. While the sea shows some movement and chop with visible whitecaps, it reads as invigorating and dynamic rather than tempestuous or violent; it is the natural state of the ocean, not an expression of wrath. The brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, gives a sense of lively motion to the water and clouds, but this motion is fluid and atmospheric, not aggressive or chaotic. There are no sharp, jagged lines or tumultuous compositions that create a feeling of tension or conflict. The overall mood conveyed is one of peaceful observation, natural grandeur, and the refreshing sensation of being outdoors by the sea. Any perceived hint of ""anger"" would be a profound misinterpretation of the artwork's visual language and intended emotional register, stemming perhaps only from the most abstract association of ""powerful nature"" with ""uncontrolled force,"" but even then, the depiction here is one of natural power that is calm and enduring, not furious or destructive. The score of 2.5 acknowledges the infinitesimal possibility of an extreme subjective projection or a momentary, fleeting interpretation of the restless sea as a *very* attenuated form of natural agitation, but it fundamentally reflects the painting's almost complete absence of any elements associated with anger."
crimea-yayla.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a serene landscape, evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter itself—a natural scene featuring a large mountain or cliff, a field, and various trees under a muted sky—is inherently peaceful and devoid of any elements that would typically provoke feelings of rage or fury. There are no depictions of conflict, destruction, suffering, or any form of aggression, whether human or natural (e.g., a violent storm, an erupting volcano). The color palette, consisting of earthy yellows, greens, and browns, along with a somber blue-gray sky, is subdued and organic, lacking the harsh, vibrant reds or sharp, clashing contrasts often associated with anger. The brushstrokes, while visible and painterly, are not chaotic or violent but rather contribute to the naturalistic depiction of the forms and textures. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet contemplation, perhaps a touch of solitude or vastness, but it is entirely tranquil and free from any emotional turbulence or hostility. There is nothing in the composition, lighting, or implied narrative that hints at or elicits an angry response."
desert-and-mountains.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The scene depicts a serene and expansive desert mountain landscape, rendered with soft, pastel-like colors, predominantly lavenders, muted pinks, soft blues, and earthy browns. The light appears gentle, perhaps early morning or late afternoon, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the distant peaks with a warm glow. There are no elements within the composition—such as harsh lines, violent movement, clashing colors, destructive imagery, or agitated brushwork—that would typically convey anger or aggression. The overall impression is one of tranquility, spaciousness, and quiet contemplation, entirely devoid of any emotional charge that could be interpreted as anger. The absence of any discernible narrative or human presence further contributes to a neutral, calm emotional landscape, making anger an entirely irrelevant descriptor for this artwork. The score is not zero because, as with any subjective interpretation, an absolute zero can be difficult to definitively claim, but it comes as close as possible, reflecting the complete lack of any visual cues associated with anger."
cuirassier-1881.jpg,impressionism,5.0,"The emotion of anger is minimally conveyed in this painting. There are no explicit visual cues such as a furious facial expression on the rider, clenched fists, or an aggressive stance that would directly indicate rage or indignation. The rider's face is obscured and rendered broadly, offering no discernible expression of anger. Furthermore, the horse does not display any signs of agitation or aggression typical of an animal responding to an angry rider. The dark, brooding sky and the rugged, indistinct terrain might evoke a sense of harshness or struggle, but these elements contribute more to an atmosphere of solemnity, perseverance, or perhaps melancholy, rather than a feeling of active anger. The overall composition and the solitary figure suggest a journey through challenging conditions, which might evoke feelings of weariness or determination, but not a strong sense of fury or resentment. The muted color palette, dominated by dark blues, grays, and earthy tones, also does not contain the vibrant reds or sharp contrasts often associated with the visual representation of anger. Any slight hint of emotional intensity derived from the turbulent brushwork in the landscape seems more aligned with the elemental forces of nature or the difficulty of the path, rather than an internal state of anger within the depicted figure."
dancers-in-light-blue-rehearsing-in-the-dance-studio.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting ""Ballet Rehearsal"" by Edgar Degas presents virtually no visual elements that would evoke or represent the emotion of anger. The scene depicts ballerinas in a studio, engaged in practice or resting. Their poses are either graceful, focused, or relaxed, characteristic of a ballet class. There are no agitated gestures, clenched fists, or aggressive stances that typically signify anger. The visible facial expressions, where discernible, are either neutral, concentrated, or obscured, offering no hint of scowling, rage, or frustration.

The color palette, predominantly composed of earthy browns, muted reds, and soft blues and greys, does not contribute to a sense of aggression or fury. There are no sharp, clashing, or intensely vibrant hues that might symbolically express anger. Instead, the colors evoke a subdued and naturalistic atmosphere.

The composition itself is calm and observational, capturing a moment in time rather than a dynamic confrontation or emotional outburst. There is no depiction of conflict between the figures, nor any environmental cues like disarray or tension that would suggest an undercurrent of anger. The discarded ballet shoes and violin on the floor reinforce the artistic context but carry no symbolic weight related to this emotion. The overall mood is one of quiet dedication, discipline, and the mundane reality behind the grace of ballet, entirely devoid of any discernible anger."
elisabeth-avenue-after-rain.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible presence of anger within this painting. The scene depicts a quiet street, possibly after rain, with people and horse-drawn carriages. The figures are engaged in everyday activities like walking, some with umbrellas, showing no aggressive postures, confrontational interactions, or distressed expressions. The atmosphere is calm and contemplative, perhaps a bit melancholic due to the muted color palette and wet ground, but entirely devoid of any tension, conflict, or frustration that might evoke anger. The subject matter itself, a city street, does not inherently carry angry connotations, nor do the artistic choices in color, composition, or brushwork suggest any agitated or furious sentiment. The overall impression is one of peaceful observation, making anger an entirely irrelevant emotion in the interpretation of this work."
christ-with-the-canaanite-woman-and-her-daughter-1909.jpg,impressionism,3.0,"The painting, with its predominant cool blues and purples, and the soft, diffused lighting, establishes a somber and contemplative mood rather than one of aggression or rage. There are no elements within the composition—such as sharp, jagged lines, violent actions, or fiery, clashing colors—that are typically employed to evoke anger. The brushwork is loose and atmospheric, contributing to a sense of quiet observation rather than agitated confrontation.

The figures themselves do not exhibit expressions or postures indicative of anger. The central figure in white appears calm and perhaps compassionate, radiating a serene presence. The other figures involved in the interaction around the archway seem engaged in a solemn or momentous exchange, but their body language and implied expressions do not convey wrath or indignation. The isolated figure on the far right is hunched and appears to be in a state of distress or dejection, but this emotion leans heavily towards sorrow or despair, not anger. While the implied narrative *could* involve themes that might, in other contexts, lead to anger (such as judgment or exclusion), the artist has chosen to depict the scene with a profound sense of quietude and introspection, deliberately steering the emotional resonance away from any form of ire. The painting invites empathy and reflection, making anger an almost entirely negligible response."
dewey-s-arch.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element in this painting that evokes or depicts anger. The scene is a bright, sunlit urban landscape featuring a grand architectural structure, likely a triumphal arch, surrounded by columns and statues. The sky is a clear, serene blue. People are depicted as small, bustling figures in a public space, engaged in what appears to be ordinary daily activities or a calm gathering. There are no harsh colors, aggressive postures, violent actions, or expressions of distress or conflict among the depicted individuals. The overall atmosphere is one of calm, perhaps grandeur or gentle activity, rather than any form of agitation or rage."
etang-also-known-as-the-pond.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The muted, earthy palette of browns, grays, and muted greens creates a serene, almost melancholic atmosphere, but not one of agitation or hostility. The soft, diffuse light from the overcast sky and the calm reflections on the water contribute to a profound sense of stillness and tranquility. There are no sharp lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or chaotic elements in the composition that might suggest conflict or frustration. The distant land and trees, though dark against the lighter sky, appear as natural, unthreatening forms. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation or a peaceful, albeit somber, moment in nature, completely devoid of any emotional intensity associated with anger."
dansatoare-oriental.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. The central figure, a dancer, exhibits a pose that is graceful and fluid, with arms raised as part of what appears to be a performance or ritual. There is no tension, rigidity, or aggression in her body language that would suggest anger. Her facial expression, while not entirely clear, does not show any typical signs of rage such as a furrowed brow, clenched jaw, or scowl; rather, it appears serene, focused, or contemplative. The snake wrapped around one arm, while an unusual element, seems integrated into the performance or symbolic act rather than being a source of conflict or a target of anger from the dancer. The color palette is vibrant and warm, dominated by reds, oranges, and blues, which contribute to an overall energetic and exotic atmosphere but do not evoke the harshness, darkness, or chaotic intensity often associated with anger. The background, depicting an outdoor scene with lush greenery and architectural elements, is open and calming, further diminishing any sense of agitation or hostility. Overall, the artwork evokes feelings of performance, exoticism, spirituality, or even allure, none of which are associated with anger."
don-juan-s-encounter-with-the-stony-gues.jpg,impressionism,92.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of anger, primarily through the depiction of intense violence and chaotic disruption. The most striking element is the scene of multiple figures lying prostrate on the floor, suggestive of injury, death, or severe distress caused by a violent act. This immediately evokes a profound sense of outrage and indignation in the viewer, as such suffering is often a direct consequence of unchecked fury or aggression. The overturned table with scattered objects further emphasizes a violent outburst, indicating that peace and order have been shattered by an aggressive force. The dark, dramatic lighting and energetic, rough brushstrokes contribute to the feeling of turmoil and raw emotional intensity, reinforcing the impression of a destructive event fueled by strong negative emotions, most notably anger. While no single character's face clearly displays anger, the *actions* and *consequences* depicted are saturated with the impact of anger, prompting a powerful emotional response of fury and resentment towards the implied perpetrators or the situation itself. The entire environment screams of an explosive, anger-driven incident."
etaples-la-canache-low-tide-1890.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting conveys an overwhelming sense of tranquility and an almost melancholic peace, which stands in direct opposition to any feeling of anger. There are no visual elements within the composition that would evoke hostility, frustration, or aggression. The sky, while cloudy, lacks any menacing or tumultuous quality that might suggest a brewing storm or emotional turmoil; instead, the clouds appear soft and diffuse. The water is calm and still, reflecting the light gently, entirely devoid of violent waves or turbulent currents. The figures depicted are engaged in quiet, mundane tasks, seemingly at peace with their surroundings, showing no signs of conflict or distress. The boats are at rest, tethered or gently floating, without any suggestion of hurried or violent movement. The color palette is composed of muted blues, grays, and earthy tones, which contribute to the serene atmosphere rather than creating any sense of jarring conflict or intensity associated with anger. The brushstrokes, though visible, are not harsh or agitated but rather soft and descriptive, lending a contemplative quality to the scene. There is a complete absence of sharp, aggressive lines, confrontational poses, or any subject matter that hints at discontent or rage. The overall mood is one of quiet observation and atmospheric calm, leaving no room for the emotion of anger to be perceived."
farmer-to-work-1883.jpg,impressionism,5.5,"The painting depicts a lone figure bent over in a field, engaged in what appears to be manual labor. There are very few elements within the artwork that evoke or suggest the emotion of anger. The figure's posture, while perhaps indicative of effort or toil, does not convey aggression, frustration, or any outward sign of rage. The face is obscured or rendered in such a way that no discernible angry expression can be detected. The colors are predominantly earthy and natural, lacking the sharp, contrasting, or fiery tones often associated with anger in art. The brushstrokes are visible and textured, but they contribute more to a sense of a rugged landscape and a working figure than to emotional turmoil. There is no narrative context, such as a struggle, conflict, or unjust situation, that would lead a viewer to infer anger. The overall impression is one of quiet, perhaps arduous, daily activity, rather than intense emotional states. Any minimal score for anger would stem only from the potential, very subtle, and highly subjective interpretation of the figure's bent-over form as perhaps conveying a quiet resentment or weariness, but this is far from an overt display of anger."
figure-and-pool-1917.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no indication of anger within this painting. The artwork depicts a figure in the act of diving into a body of water, a scene typically associated with recreation, tranquility, or athletic pursuit. The posture of the figure is one of dynamic movement and anticipation, not aggression or frustration. There are no discernible facial features that would convey an angry expression. The surrounding environment, depicted with loose, flowing brushstrokes and a naturalistic color palette of browns, greens, and blues, also lacks any harshness or chaotic elements that might suggest a volatile emotional state. The overall mood is one of immersion in nature and physical activity, completely devoid of any tension or conflict that would evoke anger."
fishing.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no visual cue or emotional resonance within this painting that evokes anger. The scene depicts a solitary figure in a small boat on calm, possibly still water, under a muted, overcast sky. The color palette is soft and desaturated, primarily composed of grays, browns, and subdued greens, contributing to a tranquil, almost melancholic or introspective atmosphere rather than one of intensity or agitation. The figure is engaged in the quiet act of rowing, a calm and deliberate action. There are no signs of conflict, frustration, aggression, or any form of emotional outburst. The overall impression is one of peace, solitude, and perhaps a quiet contemplation, entirely devoid of any element that would suggest anger or its underlying causes."
fall-scene-near-sisterdale-1909.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a serene, pastoral landscape under a bright, cloudy sky. In the foreground, two children are peacefully gathering flowers in a lush green field, their postures relaxed and their activity suggesting innocence and leisure. Further back, a man tends to cows, indicating a calm, everyday scene of rural life. The colors are predominantly natural greens, browns, and blues, with warm tones in the sky, contributing to an overall sense of tranquility and light. There are no dynamic or aggressive poses, no harsh lines, no violent or unsettling subject matter, and no strong, agitated colors typically associated with anger or conflict. The atmosphere is one of complete peacefulness and harmony. Therefore, there are no elements within the painting that evoke or suggest the emotion of anger. The score is not a perfect 0 simply because a complete absence of any trace of an emotion is nearly impossible to guarantee in any human interpretation, but it is as close to zero as can be reasonably given."
french-landscape-i-1877.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke or suggest anger. The scene depicts a serene and idyllic natural landscape bathed in sunlight, featuring an artist's peaceful setup with an easel, canvas, and parasol. The color palette consists predominantly of calming greens, blues, and earth tones, devoid of any harsh reds or jarring contrasts often associated with intense negative emotions. The composition is open and inviting, with gentle slopes and lush foliage, conveying a sense of tranquility and repose. There are no figures present to express angry gestures or facial expressions, nor are there any destructive or turbulent events unfolding. The overall impression is one of calm, leisure, and creative contemplation, entirely antithetical to any feeling of anger."
from-dieppe-to-arques-river.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. It depicts a tranquil and serene rural landscape, characterized by a calm river winding through a scene of lush trees, a distant house, and open fields under a soft, overcast sky. The color palette is subdued and harmonious, dominated by peaceful greens, earthy browns, and soft grays, which contribute to a quiet, contemplative mood rather than any agitation or hostility. There are no harsh lines, violent brushstrokes, or chaotic elements that might suggest anger or conflict. The solitary figure near the house appears static and integrated into the scene, showing no expressions or actions that would imply anger. The overall atmosphere is one of profound peace and natural beauty, completely devoid of any emotional tension, aggression, or distress that would be associated with anger."
garden-in-the-west-end-of-berlin-1925.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The scene depicts a lush garden with abundant foliage and vibrant flowers, bathed in what appears to be dappled sunlight. The subject matter itself—a tranquil garden with a solitary figure seated on a bench—is inherently peaceful and conducive to contemplation or relaxation rather than any intense, negative emotion like anger. The color palette, dominated by verdant greens, cheerful yellows, and various shades of red and pink for the flowers, is rich and natural, not jarring or aggressive. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, its use here is clearly within the context of natural floral beauty, conveying vitality and warmth, not rage or hostility. The brushwork, though visible and expressive, creates a sense of organic growth and light, contributing to a harmonious and calm atmosphere rather than any agitated or furious energy. There are no dramatic or chaotic elements, no harsh lines, no violent actions, and no facial expressions (if any could even be discerned) that would suggest internal or external conflict. The overall impression is one of serene natural beauty and quietude, leaving no discernible room for the emotion of anger to be perceived. The score is a fractional value just above zero to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of a subjective, highly idiosyncratic interpretation, but practically, anger is absent from this visual narrative."
gateway-tangier-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting presents a serene and tranquil architectural scene, primarily depicting warm, earthy tones, a calm blue sky, and figures quietly moving through an arched passage. There are no elements within the composition—such as harsh colors, aggressive brushstrokes, confrontational subject matter, or dynamic and chaotic forms—that would evoke or represent anger. The figures are depicted in peaceful white and blue, their postures suggesting measured movement rather than any form of agitation or distress. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of quiet contemplation and stillness, entirely devoid of any visual indicators that might be associated with anger or aggression."
esbo-o-para-o-vel-rio-boceto-para-el-velorio-sketch-for-the-wake-1893.jpg,impressionism,88.0,"The emotion of anger is predominantly and powerfully conveyed by the rightmost figure in the painting. This figure's contorted facial expression, with an open mouth suggesting a scream or yell, is a visceral depiction of intense emotional outburst. The eyes appear shadowed and deep-set, contributing to a sense of profound distress that can encompass rage. The dynamic pose, with arms raised and muscles tensed, implies a struggle, protest, or an aggressive, desperate action. One hand grips what appears to be a stick or tool, while the other holds a hat aloft, further emphasizing an active, almost violent, display of emotion. This is not a subtle or suppressed anger, but a raw, unbridled burst of feeling that aligns strongly with fury or righteous indignation. While the expression could also convey immense pain or despair, the sheer energy and outward projection of the pose strongly lean into the realm of active anger and defiance, making it a central and highly impactful element in the painting's emotional landscape. The other two figures do not express anger; the leftmost figure appears resigned or contemplative, and the middle figure is engaged in an act of consumption, but the culmination of emotion in the right figure is undeniably potent in its suggestion of rage."
gladiolas-in-a-vase-1875.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter, a vibrant and overflowing bouquet of flowers, is inherently beautiful and life-affirming, typically associated with joy, peace, or celebration rather than negative emotions. There are no human figures or expressions that could convey anger. The colors, while including reds and pinks, are used to depict natural floral beauty, appearing warm and inviting rather than aggressive or intense. The overall impression is one of lushness, abundance, and tranquility. The loose, impressionistic brushwork adds to the lively and natural feel of the scene, lacking any sharp, harsh, or chaotic elements that might suggest frustration, rage, or conflict. The composition is harmonious and organic, showing flowers spilling gracefully, which further contributes to a sense of calm and natural order, completely devoid of any visual cues or psychological tension that would indicate anger."
girl-in-a-doorway.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a watercolor depicting a rustic house with a thatched roof and a figure in the doorway, evokes a strong sense of tranquility and pastoral calm. There are virtually no elements within the artwork that could be interpreted as conveying anger. The color palette is composed of soft, earthy tones – muted greens, warm off-whites, and gentle blues and browns – which are inherently calming and harmonious, completely devoid of the sharp, clashing, or fiery hues often associated with anger. The brushstrokes are loose and fluid, characteristic of watercolor, contributing to a gentle and serene atmosphere rather than any sense of agitation or aggression. The subject matter itself – a quiet domestic scene amidst nature – is inherently peaceful. The figure standing in the doorway appears calm and still, showing no signs of distress, tension, or any aggressive posture. There is no visual tension, conflict, harshness, or chaotic energy present in the composition. The overall impression is one of idyllic repose, making the emotion of anger almost entirely absent from the viewer's potential response."
flowers-in-a-vase.jpg,impressionism,2.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation, possibly bordering on melancholy due to the somewhat muted colors and the appearance of certain leaves, but it is entirely devoid of any visual cues associated with rage, frustration, or aggression.

The color palette, consisting primarily of various greens, subdued reddish-orange tones for the flowers, and a muted blue-grey background, does not employ colors in a way that suggests anger. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, the specific shade of reddish-orange used for the bell-shaped flowers is soft and desaturated, and their downward-facing, drooping posture conveys a sense of quietness or perhaps weariness, rather than any fiery passion or hostility. The cool blue-grey background further contributes to a calm, rather than agitated, atmosphere.

The brushwork is fluid and somewhat impressionistic, creating soft textures and gentle forms, particularly in the leaves and the reflective surface of the glass vase. There are no sharp, aggressive lines, chaotic strokes, or violent contrasts that would typically convey an angry or turbulent emotional state. The composition is balanced and static, characteristic of a still life, and lacks any dynamic tension or implied movement that might suggest conflict or agitation.

The subject matter itself—a simple arrangement of plants in a vase—is inherently peaceful and decorative. There are no human figures or narratives depicted that could introduce themes of conflict, injustice, or frustration. While some of the lower leaves appear dense and possibly wilting, this suggests natural decay or a gentle decline, which might evoke sadness or a sense of transience, but not anger. The painting invites calm observation rather than an impassioned reaction. Therefore, the emotion of anger is almost entirely absent from this artwork."
green-hills-and-farmland.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting presents a tranquil and idyllic rural landscape. The scene features rolling hills covered in lush greenery, a winding dirt road, a small, quaint house nestled amongst trees, and a distant, peaceful vista under a light sky. There are no elements within the composition, color palette, or subject matter that suggest anger. The brushstrokes are soft and depict natural forms, devoid of any harshness or aggression. There are no figures or events that could be interpreted as conveying conflict, frustration, or rage. The overall atmosphere is one of calm, serenity, and natural beauty, which is the antithesis of anger. Therefore, there is absolutely no discernible presence of anger in this artwork."
flood-at-giverny-1897.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes a profound sense of tranquility, stillness, and perhaps a touch of melancholic serenity, which stands in direct opposition to any feeling of anger. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that suggest or provoke an emotion of anger. The color palette is composed of soft, muted tones of lavender, grey, pale blue, and subtle browns, creating a hazy, misty atmosphere rather than any harsh or fiery visual tension typically associated with anger. The brushwork is gentle and impressionistic, contributing to the soft, diffused light and reflections, lacking any aggressive, sharp, or violent strokes that might convey agitation or fury. The subject matter—bare trees standing in still, reflective water—is inherently calm and contemplative, devoid of any conflict, dynamism, or turbulent energy. The overall composition is horizontal and balanced, promoting a sense of peace rather than unrest. There is no visual tension, no abrupt changes, and no implied narrative that would lead to a feeling of anger. The atmosphere is one of quiet contemplation and perhaps isolation, but in a serene rather than an agitated way. As such, the presence of anger in response to this painting is virtually non-existent."
houses-in-provence.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke or suggest anger. The color palette consists of warm earthy tones, muted greens, and soft terracotta reds, none of which carry an aggressive or volatile connotation. The subject matter itself – a serene landscape with buildings nestled amidst trees – conveys a sense of tranquility, peace, and perhaps a touch of rustic charm. There are no figures present to express emotion, nor are there any chaotic, violent, or disturbing scenes. The brushwork, while visible, is not frantic or harsh; rather, it contributes to a quiet, almost contemplative atmosphere. The composition is stable and balanced, lacking any unsettling or dissonant elements that might provoke discomfort or ire. The overall impression is one of calm and natural harmony, directly antithetical to any sensation of anger."
havana.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke or suggest anger. The artwork depicts a bustling, sunlit city street, likely Havana, filled with people, carriages, and vibrant architecture. The dominant colors are bright yellows and blues, contributing to an overall impression of warmth, light, and activity. The brushwork, while loose and impressionistic, conveys a sense of energy and movement rather than tension or aggression. There are no figures depicted in a state of anger or conflict, nor are there any scenes of distress, protest, or destruction. The atmosphere is one of a lively, ordinary day, devoid of any visual cues that could be interpreted as hostile, confrontational, or emotionally turbulent."
harbor-in-hel-1934-1.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting conveys an overwhelming sense of tranquility and quietude, leaving virtually no room for the emotion of anger. The color palette, though vibrant with yellows, reds, and greens, is harmonious and soothing rather than jarring or confrontational, which are qualities often associated with visually expressing anger. There are no harsh, aggressive lines or turbulent forms; instead, the houses stand placidly on the shore, and the boat rests calmly on the water. The sky, while cloudy, does not suggest an impending storm or any kind of threatening atmosphere that might evoke feelings of frustration or rage. Furthermore, the subject matter itself—a peaceful harbor scene—is inherently devoid of conflict, struggle, or injustice, which are common thematic triggers for anger. There are no figures whose expressions or actions could hint at displeasure or fury, nor are there any narrative elements suggesting grievances or destruction. The gentle, almost dreamlike quality of the light and the overall composition contribute to an atmosphere of serene detachment, diametrically opposed to the intense and volatile nature of anger. Consequently, the painting utterly lacks any visual or thematic component that would resonate with or express this specific emotion."
grove-of-olive-trees-in-bordighera.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent from this painting. There are no visual cues that evoke feelings of annoyance, displeasure, or hostility. The color palette, dominated by muted greens, blues, and earthy reds, is harmonious and natural, lacking any harsh or discordant combinations typically associated with anger. The brushstrokes, while expressive and textured, do not convey violence, agitation, or aggression; rather, they contribute to the organic forms of the ancient trees and the textured ground. The subject matter itself—a grove of olive trees—is often linked with peace, endurance, or a serene, ancient presence, far from themes that would incite anger. There is no sense of conflict, struggle, or injustice depicted. The composition is grounded and stable, without any unsettling perspectives or chaotic elements that might trigger an angry response. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation, solemnity, or natural tranquility, making it impossible to attribute any significant level of anger to this artwork. The score is marginally above zero to acknowledge the incredibly remote possibility of an extremely idiosyncratic and personal association, but objectively, the painting contains no elements that communicate anger."
home-fields.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The scene depicts a serene and somewhat melancholic rural landscape, likely in late autumn or early spring, given the bare branches of the trees and the long shadows cast across the field. The subject matter itself – a quiet field, a simple fence, distant buildings – is inherently devoid of any elements typically associated with anger, such as conflict, aggression, or distress.

The color palette, dominated by greens, browns, and subdued grays with a warm highlight on the distant building, is earthy and natural, containing no jarring or fiery reds that might suggest rage. The light, possibly from a low sun, creates gentle, elongated shadows that stretch across the grass, contributing to a calm and contemplative atmosphere rather than one of agitation or hostility.

Furthermore, the brushwork, while visible and expressive, conveys a sense of natural observation and gentle movement, rather than any violent or frantic energy. There are no distorted forms, sharp, aggressive lines, or chaotic compositions that could imply internal or external turmoil. The overall impression is one of stillness, quiet reflection, and the simple beauty of nature, which stands in complete opposition to the emotional state of anger."
houses-of-parliament-in-winter.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""The Houses of Parliament, Sunset"" by Claude Monet, evokes a profound sense of tranquility, atmospheric beauty, and contemplative calm, rather than any hint of anger. The soft, diffused light of the setting sun, rendered in gentle hues of pink, orange, and muted purple, creates an ethereal and dreamlike quality that is inherently peaceful. There are no harsh lines, jarring colors, or violent brushstrokes that might suggest agitation or fury. The silhouette of the Houses of Parliament, while monumental, is depicted softly, almost melting into the hazy atmosphere, removing any sense of rigid authority or potential for conflict often associated with such a structure. The water of the Thames, reflecting the sky's subtle colors, ripples gently, further contributing to the serene and harmonious composition. The small boats are simply part of the landscape, not indicative of any intense activity or emotional strife. The entire scene is an exercise in capturing a fleeting, beautiful moment of natural light and its effects on the urban landscape, devoid of any emotional tension, discord, or aggressive undertones that would be necessary to elicit a feeling of anger."
in-the-garden-at-maurecourt.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element of anger present in this painting. The scene depicts two figures, likely women or girls, relaxing in a verdant, sun-dappled garden. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility, leisure, and natural beauty. The dominant colors are soothing greens, softened by the light brown and red tones of the figures' attire. The brushstrokes, characteristic of Impressionism, are loose and fluid, contributing to a sense of calm and spontaneity rather than tension or aggression. Neither of the figures displays any body language or facial expression (for the figure facing the viewer) that suggests anger, frustration, or any negative emotion. The figure facing the viewer has a somewhat pensive or distant gaze, but it is entirely devoid of irritation or hostility. The other figure has her back to the viewer, further emphasizing a peaceful, undisturbed presence. The composition is harmonious, and the subject matter evokes a pleasant, idyllic moment, diametrically opposed to any feeling of anger."
in-the-hills-southwest-texas-1912.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke or suggest anger. The dominant color palette consists of soft, natural hues—pale blues and gentle whites in the sky, various shades of tranquil green and earthy browns in the landscape. These colors universally communicate peace, calm, and natural harmony, standing in direct opposition to the visual language of anger, which often relies on sharp contrasts, aggressive reds, or turbulent grays.

The subject matter, a serene landscape featuring large, sturdy trees, rolling hills, and a clear, expansive sky, inherently projects tranquility and spaciousness. There are no figures depicted in a state of distress, conflict, or confrontation; the solitary, small figure in the middle ground appears to be calmly walking through the peaceful scenery. The composition is open and inviting, with a sense of gentle depth and quiet natural beauty. There are no harsh lines, chaotic forms, or unsettling shadows that might hint at underlying tension or aggression. The overall atmosphere is one of stillness and contemplation, completely devoid of any visual cues that could be interpreted as rage, frustration, or agitation."
ice-lock-port-villez.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, ""The Ice Floes"" by Claude Monet, evokes a strong sense of a cold, perhaps desolate, winter landscape rather than any feeling of anger. There are no elements within the composition, color palette, or subject matter that suggest aggression, frustration, conflict, or any form of emotional distress that would translate into anger for the viewer. The colors are predominantly cool (blues, grays, whites, muted greens) and soft, lacking the sharp contrasts, fiery tones, or intense dynamism often associated with anger. The scene depicts ice floes on a body of water under an overcast sky, with a small boat and a distant steamboat or industrial structure emitting smoke. While the conditions are harsh (ice, cold), they are depicted as a natural, almost serene phenomenon, not as a source of struggle or irritation. The brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, is fluid and captures the atmosphere rather than conveying harshness or rage. The distant smoke, while industrial, is simply part of the scene and not presented in a way that implies pollution, disturbance, or any negative impact that might provoke anger. The overall impression is one of quiet solitude and the raw beauty of winter, devoid of any emotional charge leaning towards anger. A score of 0.5 acknowledges the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly abstract interpretation by a viewer, but practically, the painting offers no visual cues for anger."
isle-of-brehat-1892.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting, depicting a serene harbor scene with various boats under an overcast sky, contains virtually no visual elements that evoke anger. The color palette is dominated by calming blues, muted grays, and earthy browns, which contribute to a sense of tranquility and natural harmony rather than agitation or fury. There are no jarring or aggressive color contrasts. The water's surface shows only gentle ripples, indicative of a calm and undisturbed environment, completely devoid of the tumultuous waves or stormy conditions often used to symbolize intense negative emotions like anger. The composition itself is peaceful, featuring boats at rest or gently moving, arranged in a way that suggests quietude and order, rather than conflict, chaos, or struggle. There are no discernible human figures displaying anger or engaging in any activity that would suggest distress or aggression. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the soft lighting and the placid natural setting is one of quiet contemplation or a gentle, everyday scene, which actively works against any interpretation of anger. The complete absence of visual cues such as sharp, aggressive lines, violent subject matter, or a disturbed, chaotic environment firmly places the emotional evocation of anger for this painting at a negligible level."
houses-on-the-zaan-river-at-zaandam.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""Houses on the Zaan,"" conveys an overwhelming sense of tranquility and peacefulness, leaving no room for any interpretation of anger. The subject matter—quaint houses nestled along calm waters with lush trees under a clear, pleasant sky—is inherently serene and devoid of any elements that could provoke agitation or hostility. The color palette consists of soft blues for the sky, gentle greens and yellows for the houses and foliage, and muted browns, all contributing to a harmonious and inviting atmosphere rather than a confrontational or aggressive one. There are no harsh lines, jarring contrasts, or turbulent forms that might suggest conflict or frustration. The visible brushstrokes, characteristic of Impressionism, are employed to capture the shimmering light and reflections on the water, creating a fluid and calm visual texture, entirely opposite to the sharp, chaotic, or intense strokes that might convey anger. The overall composition is balanced and static, further reinforcing a sense of quietude. No figures are engaged in any actions that would imply anger, and indeed, the few indistinct figures present appear to be enjoying the peaceful setting. Every visual cue within the painting points towards a complete absence of this emotion."
jardin-du-luxembourg.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicted is a serene and tranquil landscape, featuring a calm body of water reflecting the surrounding trees under what appears to be a soft, overcast sky.

hilltown.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, depicting a vibrant town scene with a river, bridge, and figures, offers no visual cues or narrative elements that could be interpreted as conveying anger. The color palette is generally bright and natural, with blues, greens, and warm earth tones, lacking the harsh reds, deep ominous blacks, or clashing contrasts often associated with this emotion. The brushwork, while visible and expressive, does not evoke turbulent or aggressive energy; rather, it contributes to a sense of liveliness. The figures are small and indistinct, showing no signs of distress, conflict, or agitated postures. The overall atmosphere is one of calm observation, everyday activity, or even pleasantness, without any hint of tension, frustration, or hostility. There are no broken elements, stormy skies, confrontational scenes, or any form of chaotic or unsettling imagery that might trigger an emotional response of anger. The painting instead leans towards a sense of peaceful coexistence and the beauty of a community in its natural setting. A score of 0.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any image might elicit an unexpected individual emotional response, but fundamentally, there is nothing within the artwork itself to suggest or evoke anger."
koncha-zaspa-ozernaya-1985.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"There are no discernible elements within this painting that evoke or portray anger. The subject, a young woman in a natural setting, appears calm and contemplative; her profile shows no furrowed brow, tense jawline, or any facial expression indicative of anger or frustration. Her body language is relaxed, standing casually in the tall grass, without any signs of aggression, tension, or agitation. The color palette, predominantly soft greens, earth tones, and gentle blues and pinks in the wildflowers, contributes to a serene and peaceful atmosphere, which is antithetical to feelings of anger. The overall impression conveyed by the artwork is one of tranquility and quiet observation, devoid of any emotional turmoil or conflict."
jockeys-1.jpg,impressionism,5.0,"The painting, likely by Edgar Degas, depicts jockeys on horseback, possibly before or after a race. The overall mood is one of quiet anticipation, movement, and perhaps a slight sense of natural energy. There are no visual elements within the composition that actively convey anger. The jockeys' postures are relaxed yet attentive, with no signs of tension, aggression, or frustration. Their faces are not rendered with enough detail to discern specific emotions, but their general demeanor appears calm. The horses, while showing dynamic movement in some instances, do not exhibit any signs of being agitated, distressed, or aggressive in a way that would evoke anger. The color palette, dominated by earthy browns, greens, and soft blues, does not feature any strong, passionate reds or harsh contrasts typically associated with rage or hostility. The brushstrokes, though active and expressive, contribute to a sense of vitality rather than violent emotion. There is no depicted conflict, struggle, or resentment. The scene is one of observation and natural activity, devoid of any emotional charge related to anger. The score is a very low 5, acknowledging the most minimal, almost imperceptible, potential for competitive intensity that could *indirectly* lead to frustration, but nothing explicit or even subtly suggestive of anger itself."
la-jolla-arbor.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes emotions diametrically opposed to anger. Every element within the composition contributes to a profound sense of tranquility, serenity, and natural beauty. The dominant color palette of lush greens and vibrant blues, particularly the calming expanse of the water, inherently soothes rather than agitates. There are no harsh or jarring contrasts that might symbolize conflict or tension. The subject matter itself—a peaceful veranda overlooking a sun-drenched seascape, adorned with flourishing plants and delicate red flowers—is idyllic and inviting, devoid of any visual cues that could be interpreted as aggressive, threatening, or frustrating. The soft, dappled light filtering through the overhead vines creates a gentle, almost meditative atmosphere. There are no human figures whose expressions or actions could convey anger, nor are there any chaotic or dissonant forms. The overall impression is one of harmonious coexistence with nature, a quiet refuge from any form of discord. Therefore, the emotion of anger is entirely absent from this work."
kwiaty.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a still life of yellow flowers in a dark vase, conveys no discernible elements that would evoke or represent anger. The color palette consists predominantly of warm yellows, deep greens, and various shades of brown, which are generally associated with warmth, nature, and stability rather than intense negative emotions. There are no sharp, jarring contrasts or aggressive reds that might hint at agitation or hostility. The subject matter itself—a floral arrangement—is inherently peaceful and decorative, typically associated with beauty, calm, or even joy, not conflict or rage. The brushwork, while visible and somewhat textured, especially in the petals of the chrysanthemums, is not frenetic, violent, or chaotic in a way that would suggest an angry hand or an angry subject. Rather, it appears to be an expressive technique to capture light and form. The composition is balanced and harmonious, lacking any unsettling diagonals, distorted forms, or a sense of impending disruption often used to convey anger. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, creating a serene atmosphere rather than harsh, dramatic shadows that could imply tension or aggression. There is no narrative element, symbolism, or implied movement within the painting that would lead a viewer to perceive anger. The mood is contemplative and perhaps a little melancholic due to the muted background, but entirely devoid of any sense of fury, frustration, or hostility.

The scene depicts a serene and majestic mountain landscape with a body of water and trees, rendered with an impressionistic style. The colors, consisting mainly of blues, whites, and earthy browns and greens, are cool and natural, entirely lacking the reds, harsh blacks, or jarring contrasts often associated with anger. The brushwork, while active and textural, is descriptive of the natural forms and atmospheric conditions, not aggressive or tumultuous in a way that would convey emotional rage or fury. There are no human or animal figures exhibiting anger, no violent or confrontational subject matter, and no dramatic or disruptive compositional elements that would trigger such an emotional response.

inside-the-studio-of-the-painter-with-errazuriz-damsel.jpg,impressionism,62.5,"The emotion of anger, while not overtly expressed through a specific facial grimace or aggressive pose from the central figure, is strongly evoked through several powerful artistic choices that contribute to a pervasive sense of agitated tension and psychological turmoil.

Firstly, the dominant color palette of deep, bruised reds and murky browns creates an oppressive and intense atmosphere. While red is often associated with passion and vitality, in this context, its deep, almost smoldering quality, combined with the dark shadows, leans heavily towards feelings of unease, brooding frustration, or even suppressed rage. It's not the explosive, fiery red of active fury, but rather a visceral, almost blood-like hue that suggests an internal heat or a deeply unsettling emotional state.

Secondly, the highly expressive and visible brushwork is a significant contributor to the sense of anger. The thick, scumbled, and almost violently applied strokes, particularly evident in the background and around the frame, convey a raw, untamed energy. This agitated application of paint suggests a powerful emotional state on the part of the artist, which translates into a feeling of discomfort, struggle, or intense"
late-afternoon-giverny-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicts a serene and tranquil landscape, likely an early morning or late afternoon vista, characterized by soft, natural light and a gentle mist.

The scene depicts two women engaged in the quiet, laborious task of washing clothes by a river under an overcast sky. Their postures are focused on their work, not expressive of any strong emotion, and certainly not anger. The muted color palette of grays, browns, and subtle blues contributes to a somber or contemplative mood, rather than one of agitation or hostility. The landscape itself is calm and expansive, lacking any dramatic or chaotic elements that might suggest emotional turmoil. There is no visual narrative of conflict, injustice, or frustration that would elicit an angry response from the viewer or suggest anger within the depicted figures. The overall impression is one of everyday life and serene, albeit perhaps arduous, existence."
landscape-in-la-roche-guyon-1887.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a vibrant and sun-drenched landscape, evokes feelings of peace, warmth, and bucolic tranquility rather than anger. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest conflict, aggression, distress, or any form of hostility. The color palette is composed of warm, harmonious tones—greens, yellows, oranges, and earthy browns, punctuated by patches of serene blue sky. These colors are inherently soothing and natural, completely devoid of the sharp, jarring, or violent hues often associated with anger (such as aggressive reds or turbulent dark grays/blacks). The brushwork is loose and impressionistic, capturing the play of light and the texture of the landscape in a soft, non-confrontational manner; it lacks any harsh lines, abrupt movements, or jagged forms that might convey tension or agitation.

There are no figures depicted in states of anger or struggle, nor are there any signs of destruction, chaos, or natural disaster. The overall atmosphere is one of calm, natural beauty and quiet contemplation, offering an escape from turmoil rather than reflecting it.

marble-steps.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The scene depicts a tranquil canal in Venice, likely on an overcast day, with calm, reflective water and gentle architectural forms. The color palette is muted and harmonious, dominated by soft greens, grays, and browns, which contribute to a serene and introspective mood rather than an agitated or aggressive one. There are no figures in the foreground, and the few distant figures are small and indistinct, showing no signs of distress, conflict, or any emotion that could be interpreted as anger. The overall composition is balanced and peaceful, with the steps leading down to the water and the quiet presence of a gondola further reinforcing a sense of calm. There are no harsh lines, violent gestures, or disruptive elements that would typically be associated with the emotion of anger. The entire atmosphere of the artwork conveys quietude and contemplative stillness, making any association with anger entirely absent."
landscape-2.jpg,impressionism,62.5,"The emotion of anger, while not the sole or primary message of this landscape painting, is conveyed through several impactful artistic choices, leading to a score above the midpoint. Firstly, the prominent and deliberate use of vibrant red is a strong indicator. These aren't merely naturalistic red flowers; they appear as intense, almost fiery bursts of color, particularly the central red mass and the larger formation in the lower right. Red is universally associated with strong emotions, including passion, urgency, and critically, anger or aggression. Their placement and intensity act as visual focal points that disrupt any sense of calm.

Secondly, the overall brushwork and texture contribute significantly to an agitated feeling. The strokes are broad, visible, and applied with a discernible force across the canvas, particularly in the dark brown ""mountains"" and the various green and yellow areas. This gestural and somewhat raw application lacks softness or delicate blending, suggesting a forceful or energetic execution that can be interpreted as a reflection of internal intensity or even frustration. The painting feels less ""painted"" and more ""expressed"" with vigor.

Furthermore, the lack of serene tranquility in the composition, despite being a landscape, hints at an underlying emotional turbulence. The jagged forms of the land and the dynamic, almost restless quality of the brushstrokes create a sense of movement that verges on agitation rather than peaceful flow. While the blues and greens offer some natural balance, the overriding impression is one of intense color contrasts and expressive marks that prevent the scene from feeling placid. The energy imbued by these elements, particularly the stark reds and the forceful application of paint, translates into a noticeable degree of underlying tension or agitated emotion, consistent with an element of anger."
madame-manet-in-conservatory-1879.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no visual elements within this painting that convey anger. The subject's facial expression is calm and composed, with no furrowed brow, tightened lips, or tense gaze typically associated with this emotion. Her eyes look gently to the side, suggesting contemplation or observation rather than confrontation or agitation. Her body posture appears relaxed; her hands are clasped gently, a gesture that could indicate thoughtfulness or patience, but not aggression or frustration. The lines of her shoulders and arms are soft, not rigid or tense. The background, filled with lush green foliage and delicate white flowers, evokes a sense of tranquility and nature, which further contrasts with any notion of anger or discord. The overall mood of the painting is one of quietude and introspection, completely devoid of any dynamism or harshness that might suggest anger. The color palette is largely muted, with soft greens and browns, and there are no strong, aggressive brushstrokes or jarring contrasts that would signal an agitated state. Therefore, no anger is discernible in this work."

There are no harsh contrasts, jarring lines, or turbulent forms that might suggest rage or frustration. The composition is balanced and harmonious, with the calm surface of the water reflecting the gentle light of the sky. The large tree, the lily pads, and the distant, hazy landscape all contribute to an atmosphere of stillness and natural beauty. There are no figures or implied narratives that convey conflict, aggression, or any form of distress. The visible brushstrokes, while textured, are not violent or agitated; instead, they contribute to the atmospheric quality of the scene. Overall, the painting's mood is entirely devoid of any elements that would elicit or represent anger."
nasturtiums.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""Nasturtiums"" by Gustave Caillebotte, evokes no discernible sense of anger. The subject matter – vibrant orange nasturtium flowers and lush green leaves against a warm, earthy background – is inherently peaceful and natural. There are no elements within the composition that suggest conflict, tension, aggression, or any form of emotional distress. The colors, while bright (the orange of the flowers), are harmonious and organic, lacking any harshness or jarring contrasts that might contribute to a feeling of anger.

normans-woe-gloucester-massachusetts.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The scene depicts a serene and tranquil bay or harbor with sailboats resting on calm waters under a soft sky. The colors used are predominantly cool greens, blues, and muted earth tones for the sails and rocks, all contributing to a peaceful and harmonious palette, rather than one that would signify rage or agitation. There are no dramatic or aggressive brushstrokes; instead, the application of paint creates a gentle, almost shimmering effect on the water. The subject matter itself—boats gently afloat, a peaceful coastline, and birds in the sky—is inherently calm and devoid of any conflict, struggle, or tension that might trigger an angry response.

The color palette is dominated by soft, muted tones: delicate pinks from the blossoming trees, subtle greens in the distant foliage, a serene light blue in the sky, and warm, earthy browns and yellows in the cultivated foreground.

There are no figures, events, or objects within the scene that could be interpreted as a source of contention, aggression, or distress. Even the bare branches of some trees contribute to a sense of natural cycles rather than suggesting desolation or irritation.

The composition is open and balanced, guiding the eye through a peaceful vista without any abruptness or chaotic elements. The brushwork is soft and painterly, contributing to an overall impression of quiet contemplation rather than agitated energy.

northeast-gorge-at-appledore.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this painting that conveys or evokes the emotion of anger. The scene depicts a serene and bright coastal landscape, characterized by light-colored rocks, clear blue water, and a calm sky. The colors used are predominantly light and natural, with blues, whites, and earthy tones that contribute to a peaceful atmosphere. There are no harsh lines, turbulent forms, or dark, brooding colors that might suggest hostility or agitation. The small figure in the water appears to be peacefully immersed, without any indication of struggle, distress, or conflict. The overall impression is one of tranquility, natural beauty, and a quiet sense of presence, entirely devoid of any visual cues or narrative elements that would elicit anger."
morning-on-the-seine-clear-weather-02.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The predominant colors are cool blues and greens, traditionally associated with calmness, serenity, and contemplation rather than the agitated energy of anger, which is often linked to warmer, more aggressive tones like reds or oranges. The subject matter itself – a placid body of water reflecting the surrounding foliage and sky – is inherently peaceful and devoid of any elements that would suggest conflict, aggression, or turmoil. There are no figures expressing rage, no turbulent scenes, nor any sharp, chaotic lines or violent brushstrokes that could convey such an emotion. Instead, the loose, gentle brushwork and the harmonious balance of reflections contribute to an overwhelmingly tranquil and meditative atmosphere. The overall impression is one of natural beauty and quietude, the antithesis of anger or agitation."
old-teacher-portrait-of-mykola-murashko-1906-3-2.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. The seated woman's expression is calm and somewhat pensive, showing no signs of furrowed brows, tense facial muscles, or a glaring gaze typically associated with this emotion. Her posture is relaxed, leaning back in the chair, which further negates any impression of agitation or aggression. While the vibrant and bold color palette includes reds and purples, these hues are used harmoniously and expressively, contributing to a lively and bright atmosphere rather than indicating rage or hostility. The blues and greens of the background and water evoke a serene, natural setting. There is no dynamic tension or chaotic brushwork that would suggest an outburst or internal turmoil. The overall impression is one of leisure, contemplation, or quiet presence, entirely devoid of any visual cues that might signal anger."
november-in-nevada-1935.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a majestic landscape featuring golden-leaved trees against dark mountains and a vast sky with illuminated clouds, presents no visual cues or thematic elements that could reasonably evoke anger. The color palette, dominated by warm yellows and oranges of the foliage and ground, contrasted with deep blues and purples of the mountains and sky, is harmonious and suggestive of natural beauty, perhaps autumn or a specific time of day like dusk or dawn, rather than emotional turmoil. The clouds, while dynamic, appear to be catching light, contributing to an atmospheric rather than threatening sky. The trees stand vibrantly, their forms suggesting a natural grace rather than any gnarled rage or violent struggle. There are no figures, conflicts, harsh movements, or aggressive brushstrokes that might instill a sense of indignation, frustration, or wrath in the viewer. The overall impression conveyed by the artwork is one of serenity, vastness, and natural grandeur, which stands in stark opposition to the emotion of anger. Any score above zero would only account for the most minimal, almost imperceptible, and subjective association, as there is truly nothing in the composition to inherently spark or reflect anger."
orchard-in-bloom-neskuchnoye-1908.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes feelings of peace, tranquility, and the beauty of nature, particularly the arrival of spring. The dominant colors are vibrant yellows, soft greens, and gentle whites, which are typically associated with light, warmth, and new beginnings, not anger. There are no harsh lines, clashing colors, distorted figures, or chaotic brushstrokes that might suggest agitation or fury. The composition, featuring a path winding through blooming trees, is inviting and serene. The overall impression is one of calm and natural harmony, making the presence of anger completely absent in its emotional resonance."
pavasaris-1930.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The scene depicted is a serene winter or early spring landscape, characterized by calm waters, snowy banks, and bare trees. The colors used, including the cool blues, whites, and browns, along with the reddish hues of the distant tree trunks, are harmonious and natural, conveying a peaceful or contemplative mood rather than agitation or hostility. There are no sharp, clashing, or aggressive color combinations that might suggest emotional turmoil. The brushwork, while dynamic and textural, is not chaotic or violent; instead, it contributes to the natural depiction of light and reflection. There are no discernible elements within the composition—such as figures in distress, signs of conflict, destructive forces, or harsh environmental conditions—that would typically trigger or represent anger. The overall impression is one of tranquility and the quiet beauty of nature, completely devoid of any emotional intensity associated with anger."
pine-trees.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke or suggest anger. The artwork depicts a serene and natural forest scene, characterized by tall tree trunks bathed in dappled sunlight and a glimpsed blue sky. The color palette consists of calming greens, earthy browns, and tranquil blues, all of which contribute to a sense of peace and natural harmony. The brushstrokes, while visible and impressionistic, do not convey any aggression, agitation, or harshness; rather, they appear spontaneous and lively, capturing the essence of the light and foliage. There are no figures, narratives of conflict, destructive elements, or jarring compositional choices that could potentially trigger a feeling of anger. The overall impression is one of quiet beauty, contemplation, and calm, making the presence of anger completely incongruous with the visual and emotional content of the artwork."
peasant-home-in-curtea-de-arge-1922.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a rustic house amidst a landscape, conveys no discernible emotion of anger whatsoever. The subject matter itself is entirely devoid of conflict, tension, or any situation that would typically evoke such a strong negative feeling; it is simply a portrayal of architecture and nature. The color palette, predominantly composed of earthy browns, muted greens, whites, and dark blues/greys, lacks the fiery reds, sharp contrasts, or aggressive tones often associated with anger. Instead, the colors contribute to a rather subdued, perhaps contemplative, or melancholic atmosphere, but certainly not one of rage. The brushwork, while visible and impressionistic, is not frantic, agitated, or violent in a way that would suggest an angry hand or subject. The overall composition is stable and lacks any jarring elements or dynamic lines that might imply aggression or turmoil. There are no human figures or elements within the scene that express or imply anger, nor is there any narrative context that points to conflict or discontent. The scene appears peaceful and still, completely antithetical to the emotion of anger."
painters-on-the-beach.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting presents a serene and tranquil scene of an artist engaged in painting by the water's edge, surrounded by boats. There are absolutely no visual cues within the artwork that suggest the emotion of anger. The color palette is harmonious and calm, featuring gentle blues of the water, soft purples in the distant waves, and warm browns and yellows of the land, none of which are typically associated with intense negative emotions like anger. There are no harsh, clashing, or turbulent colors that might evoke irritation or rage. The composition is peaceful and open, showing a relaxed environment with no signs of conflict, tension, or aggression. The central figure, presumably an artist, is depicted in a calm, focused posture, absorbed in their creative process. There are no angry expressions, agitated body language, or any dynamic elements that could be interpreted as violent or confrontational. The brushwork, while impressionistic and visible, is not frenzied or aggressive in a way that would convey an artist painting out of anger or frustration. Instead, it seems to capture the light and atmosphere of a peaceful day. The overall mood conveyed by the painting is one of quiet contemplation, artistic endeavor, and natural beauty, making the presence of anger completely incongruous with the visual information."
place-de-l-opera-caf-de-la-paix.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no visual elements within this painting that evoke or suggest anger. The scene depicts a bustling street in what appears to be a European city, likely Paris, with pedestrians, horse-drawn carriages, and architectural landmarks under what seems to be a damp, overcast sky. The figures are engaged in daily activities, walking or standing, with no discernible expressions of rage, frustration, or conflict. There are no aggressive gestures, confrontational interactions, or scenes of violence. The color palette, while somewhat muted with grays and blues, is punctuated by warm, inviting yellows and oranges from the illuminated shop windows and streetlights, which contributes to a sense of urban warmth and activity rather than coldness or hostility. The brushstrokes, while impressionistic, do not convey agitation or turmoil. The overall atmosphere is one of serene activity, perhaps even a touch of melancholy or nostalgia, but entirely devoid of any sense of anger or hostility."
okhotino-september-1915.jpg,impressionism,38.0,"The primary source of any perceived anger in this painting stems from the portrayal of the sky. The vast expanse of dark, heavy, and tumultuous clouds dominates the upper portion of the composition, creating a powerful and somewhat oppressive atmosphere. The deep blues, purples, and greys used for the clouds evoke a sense of foreboding and immense natural power, akin to a brewing storm or a moment of nature's ""fury."" The visible, vigorous brushstrokes in the sky further enhance this feeling of turbulence and agitation, suggesting a restless and potentially volatile state.

While there are no explicit human figures expressing anger, nor is there visible destruction, the sheer intensity and dramatic weight of the sky can be metaphorically interpreted as a manifestation of a powerful, untamed, and agitated force. The overall mood is far from peaceful or serene; instead, it projects a raw, intense energy that, when viewed through the lens of human emotion, can align with aspects of anger or wrath. However, since it is a natural scene and not a direct depiction of human emotion or conflict, the score remains in the lower-to-mid range, indicating a subtle, atmospheric resonance with anger rather than an overt expression of it."
place-de-la-madeleine-2.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a bustling street scene, likely in Paris, rendered with a soft, atmospheric quality. The overall mood is one of quiet activity and perhaps a touch of melancholic reflection, enhanced by the muted color palette and the apparent wet ground reflecting light. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest anger. The figures are engaged in everyday activities, none displaying aggressive postures or expressions. There are no signs of conflict, destruction, or social unrest. The colors are gentle, not harsh or jarring. The brushstrokes, while visible, are not frantic or agitated in a way that would convey rage. The scene is observational and serene, completely devoid of any visual cues or thematic content that could evoke anger in the viewer or represent anger within the scene itself. A score of 0.5 is assigned instead of a perfect 0 to acknowledge the subjective nature of emotional interpretation and the extremely remote possibility that someone might find a hint of frustration in the implied busyness of the city, though this is highly unlikely and not supported by any visual evidence."
pink-bush-1906.jpg,impressionism,1.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that specifically evoke anger. While the sky displays a turbulent, perhaps stormy, quality with agitated brushwork and shifting shades of purple, blue, and white, this turbulence primarily conveys natural power or atmospheric drama rather than human wrath or aggression. The colors, though deep, lack the harsh, confrontational reds or aggressive contrasts typically associated with anger. There are no figures expressing rage, no scenes of conflict, violence, or destruction, nor any visual cues suggesting hostility or resentment. The unusual motif of a city nestled within a tree is more fantastical or contemplative than threatening or infuriating. The overall mood leans towards the enigmatic or atmospheric, rather than embodying any form of fuming or aggressive emotional state. Any perceived ""energy"" in the painting stems from its dynamic brushwork and dramatic sky, which are more akin to expressive force or natural phenomena than an angry outburst."
port-of-dieppe-evening.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The primary emotions conveyed are tranquility, serenity, and a contemplative quietude, which are diametrically opposed to anger. The color palette, dominated by soft blues, muted grays, and the gentle warm hues of orange and yellow from the setting or rising sun, is inherently harmonious and peaceful. These colors create an atmospheric sense of calm, rather than the intense, often clashing, or fiery tones that might suggest rage or aggression.

Furthermore, the subject matter itself—a harbor scene at dawn or dusk with reflections on still water and a distant cityscape—is devoid of any elements that could incite or portray anger. There are no figures expressing distress or conflict, no chaotic or violent movements depicted, and no turbulent or unsettling forms. The Impressionistic brushwork, while dynamic in capturing light and atmosphere, creates a sense of fluidity and gentle movement, not sharp, aggressive, or agitated strokes that could hint at emotional turmoil. The overall composition is balanced and horizontal, lending a sense of stability and peace. There is nothing dissonant, confrontational, or disruptive about the scene that would align with feelings of anger."
potato-market-boulevard-des-fosses-pontoise-1882.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no discernible elements within this painting that convey anger. The scene depicts a bustling outdoor market or street, with figures engaged in daily activities. The two prominent women in the foreground appear focused on their tasks; the woman facing the viewer has a neutral, almost contemplative expression as she looks down, while the woman with her back turned is bent over, seemingly attending to goods. Neither their postures, gestures, nor implied facial expressions suggest any form of irritation, frustration, aggression, or rage. The figures in the background are indistinct but appear to be going about their business without any indication of conflict or distress. The color palette, dominated by warm earthy tones, blues, and greens, is generally harmonious and does not feature jarring or harsh contrasts typically used to evoke anger. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of activity and everyday life, devoid of any tension or negativity that might lead one to perceive anger."
portrait-of-poly-fisherman-at-kervillaouen.jpg,impressionism,2.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no signs that would lead one to perceive anger in the subject. The man's facial expression lacks typical indicators of wrath: there is no furrowing of the brow, the eyes are not narrowed or glaring with hostility, and while his gaze is direct, it conveys more of a contemplative or perhaps world-weary solemnity rather than aggression. The mouth, largely obscured by the thick beard, does not suggest a scowl or a tensed jaw. His posture appears relaxed rather than tense or confrontational, and there is no visible tension in his shoulders or body language. Furthermore, the color palette, while utilizing some warm tones on the face, does not depict a flushed, enraged countenance, but rather appears to represent natural skin tones and the ruggedness of his features. The overall atmosphere of the portrait is one of quiet contemplation or perhaps a certain melancholy, entirely devoid of any agitated or furious energy that would signal anger."
poplars-at-giverny-2.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, ""Poplars, End of Autumn"" by Claude Monet, exhibits virtually no characteristics that would evoke or represent anger. The color palette is composed of soft greens, blues, browns, and light grays, which are inherently natural and tranquil, completely devoid of the sharp, clashing, or aggressive hues (such as violent reds or harsh, discordant contrasts) often associated with feelings of rage or fury. The brushwork, while visibly Impressionistic, is applied with a focus on capturing light, atmosphere, and the textures of nature; it lacks any frenetic, turbulent, or chaotic strokes that might convey agitation, aggression, or emotional turmoil. Furthermore, the subject matter itself—a serene natural landscape featuring a row of tall poplar trees alongside water—contains no narrative elements of conflict, struggle, or confrontation. There are no figures expressing anger, no dramatic events unfolding, nor any visual cues suggesting tension, frustration, or a violent outburst. The composition is orderly, calm, and contemplative, emphasizing the peaceful verticality of the trees and the gentle reflection on the water. Therefore, the painting offers no visual or thematic stimuli to elicit or convey the emotion of anger."
prayer-in-the-saint-pierre-cathedral-in-geneva-1882.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a solemn and quiet church service. The figures, including the preacher and the congregants, are engaged in prayer or listening, and their postures and obscured expressions convey reverence, introspection, or attentiveness, rather than any form of anger. There are no signs of conflict, distress, or aggression in the scene. The color palette is muted and harmonious, contributing to a calm atmosphere. There are no harsh lines, turbulent compositions, or agitated gestures that would typically be associated with the emotion of anger. The overall impression is one of peace and religious devotion, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would suggest or evoke anger."
rbol-ca-do.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene is a tranquil landscape featuring a prominent, ancient tree with gnarled, arching branches framing a view of open fields, distant hills, and a soft, cloudy sky. The color palette is composed of natural, earthy tones—soft greens for the foliage, warm browns for the tree trunk, and gentle blues and purples for the sky and distant mountains. These colors are inherently soothing and peaceful, lacking any sharp contrasts, aggressive hues, or unsettling combinations that might provoke feelings of irritation or fury. The brushstrokes are fluid and typical of watercolor, contributing to a soft and gentle overall atmosphere rather than one of intensity or conflict. There are no figures in the painting that display angry expressions or actions, nor are there any elements of destruction, chaos, or injustice depicted. The overall mood is one of serenity, contemplation, and perhaps a touch of pastoral quietude, which stands in direct opposition to any sensation of anger. The tree, while old and weathered, conveys resilience and endurance rather than any form of wrath or bitterness."
riverman-1884.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting does not evoke any sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicts a solitary figure in a small boat, seemingly engaged in a calm and deliberate action, perhaps punting through the water. There is no facial expression visible on the figure to suggest anger, nor is their body language indicative of frustration, aggression, or rage; instead, their posture appears focused and perhaps a little weary, but certainly not angry. The color palette, dominated by warm yellows, oranges, and soft purples, with touches of green, contributes to a tranquil and contemplative atmosphere, rather than one of tension or conflict. The brushwork, characteristic of Pointillism or a similar post-impressionist style, creates a dappled, light-filled surface for the water, but it does not convey turbulence or agitation that might be associated with an angry mood. There are no elements within the composition—no dramatic events, harsh contrasts, or chaotic forms—that would lead a viewer to perceive anger in this artwork. The overall impression is one of quietude and peaceful immersion in a natural setting."
roceira-1930.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting conveys no discernible sense of anger whatsoever. Both figures exhibit calm and relaxed postures, with their hands resting easily and their bodies appearing at ease. The woman on the left, with her slight smile and thoughtful gaze, projects a serene and pleasant demeanor. Her expression suggests engagement in a friendly or contemplative conversation, not one fraught with tension or conflict. Similarly, the woman on the right, looking towards her companion, displays an attentive yet composed expression. There are no furrowed brows, tense jaws, narrowed eyes, or any other facial cues typically associated with anger. The overall body language of both women indicates a comfortable and amicable interaction. Furthermore, the warm, natural lighting and harmonious color palette of the outdoor setting contribute to a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere, entirely devoid of any visual elements that might suggest aggression, frustration, or hostility. The scene is one of quiet companionship and everyday life, leaving no room for an interpretation of anger. The score is marginally above zero to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of a subjective, highly abstract, and non-evident interpretation that does not align with any visual evidence in the painting."
rockport-boats-in-a-harbor.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicted is a tranquil harbor, likely in winter or early spring, with boats floating calmly on the water and snow-dusted houses along the shore. The colors, while varied and vibrant, are harmonious and contribute to a peaceful, rather than agitated, atmosphere. The brushwork, though visible and dynamic, creates a sense of light and movement on the water without suggesting any violent or turbulent energy. There are no figures expressing anger, no chaotic or destructive elements, and no visual cues like harsh lines, jarring contrasts, or aggressive subject matter that would typically be associated with this emotion. The overall impression is one of quiet serenity, completely antithetical to any feeling of anger."
rocky-coast-1896.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a serene coastal landscape featuring large rocks and the ocean. There are no elements within the composition, color palette, or subject matter that evoke or even subtly suggest anger. The colors are muted and natural, consisting of earthy browns and ochres for the rocks and sand, and tranquil blues and whites for the ocean and sky. The brushstrokes, while visible and textural, do not convey agitation or violence. The waves are shown as gentle and frothy, not turbulent or destructive. There are no figures expressing emotions, no dramatic or chaotic events unfolding, and no harsh contrasts or sharp, aggressive lines that might be associated with an angry sentiment. The overall atmosphere is one of rugged natural beauty and quiet contemplation, entirely devoid of any visual cues for anger."
roquefort.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This still life painting of a bottle, a glass, and a cheese dome on a wooden table evokes no discernible sense of anger. The subject matter itself—common household objects arranged for a quiet meal or contemplation—is inherently placid and devoid of conflict or distress. There are no figures whose expressions or gestures could convey rage. The color palette, composed of soft greens, muted yellows, warm browns, and gentle greys, contributes to a calm and harmonious atmosphere rather than one of agitation or aggression. There are no harsh, jarring colors or sharp contrasts that might indicate emotional turmoil. Furthermore, the composition is balanced and orderly, presenting a stable and peaceful scene. The brushwork, while visible and somewhat loose, does not appear frantic or violent; instead, it creates texture and suggests an observational, unhurried rendering. There are no broken items, spilled liquids, or chaotic elements that might suggest a moment of frustration or anger. The overall impression is one of quiet domesticity or a simple, uneventful moment, leaving no room for an interpretation of anger. The score is a negligible 0.1 rather than a perfect 0 to acknowledge the theoretical impossibility of absolute zero in subjective interpretation, but practically, anger is entirely absent from this artwork's emotional resonance."
roman-architecture.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting is an architectural study, primarily focused on the interplay of light and shadow within a grand interior space. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that suggest or evoke the emotion of anger. The subject matter is inanimate architecture, offering no human figures or narrative context that could convey aggression, conflict, or frustration. The color palette, dominated by warm yellows, ochres, and browns, with deep but harmonious shadows, contributes to a mood of peaceful contemplation or serene observation rather than hostility or rage. There are no harsh, jarring contrasts, fiery reds, or chaotic brushstrokes that are often associated with the visual representation of anger. The composition is stable and orderly, depicting a sense of structure and quiet dignity, which is contrary to the turbulent or agitated feelings associated with anger.

roses-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a still life depicting a cluster of pink roses and their accompanying green foliage against a muted, earthy background, evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. Every element within the composition contributes to a feeling of softness, tranquility, and natural beauty, directly counteracting any possibility of perceiving anger. The subject matter itself – flowers – is universally associated with peace, love, and serenity, not conflict or aggression. The palette is dominated by gentle pastels; the delicate pinks of the rose petals, the soft greens of the leaves, and the subtle, warm brown and purplish tones of the background are all harmonious and soothing. There are no harsh contrasts, jarring colors, or sharp, aggressive lines. The brushstrokes are loose, fluid, and impressionistic, capturing the ephemeral quality of the blossoms rather than any agitated energy. The composition is balanced and organic, with the forms flowing gracefully, devoid of any tension or disarray that might hint at agitation. There are no figures expressing anger, no chaotic scenes, no symbols of conflict. The overall impression is one of gentle calm and delicate beauty, leaving absolutely no room for an interpretation of anger."
rainbow.jpg,impressionism,1.0,"The painting primarily evokes feelings of calm, contemplation, and perhaps a sense of serene beauty following a natural event. The dark, heavy sky might initially suggest a somber or even oppressive atmosphere, which, in a highly abstract and subjective interpretation, *could* be fleetingly linked to a sense of frustration or disquietude that *might* be a precursor to anger for some viewers. However, this is largely negated and fundamentally shifted by the prominent presence of the vibrant rainbow, which universally symbolizes hope, peace, and the resolution of conflict (the storm). There are no aggressive colors, violent brushstrokes, depictions of human or animal conflict, injustice, or any other elements typically associated with anger. The scene is one of vast, quiet nature, devoid of any direct triggers for this emotion. Therefore, the presence of anger is negligible, almost entirely absent."

The color palette, dominated by warm pinks, soft yellows, various greens, and rich reds, contributes to a harmonious and inviting atmosphere rather than one of discord or fury. The brushwork, while expressive and loose, is applied in a manner that feels lively and natural, devoid of any harsh, violent, or agitated strokes that might imply an angry hand or mood. The composition is balanced and inviting, without any elements that clash or create visual discomfort that could be interpreted as a manifestation of anger. The overall mood is one of beauty, tranquility, and perhaps celebratory pleasure, which stands in stark contrast to any notion of anger or resentment."
roses-in-a-vase.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a vibrant still life featuring a bouquet of flowers in a vase, evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter itself – a natural arrangement of blooming flowers – is inherently peaceful, beautiful, and life-affirming, offering no visual cues or narrative that would provoke ire or resentment. The color palette, though rich with reds and greens, is used harmoniously; the reds appear as natural floral hues, conveying vibrancy and warmth rather than aggression or rage. The soft, impressionistic brushstrokes, characteristic of the artist, create a sense of delicate movement and light, contributing to an overall mood of tranquility and aesthetic pleasure, rather than tension or conflict. There are no sharp lines, discordant shapes, or chaotic compositions that might suggest discord or frustration.

rowlandson-house-sunset-1912.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. There are no visual cues such as aggressive brushstrokes, harsh or clashing colors, depictions of conflict, or any figures expressing rage or frustration. The scene, featuring buildings, lush foliage, and a soft, somewhat hazy sky, leans towards a contemplative or serene atmosphere rather than one of hostility or indignation. While the large building on the left is dark and imposing, it doesn't convey an active sense of aggression or an emotion akin to anger; it simply exists within the landscape. The subtle yellows in the sky suggest light rather than a fiery intensity associated with rage. Overall, the composition and color palette are too subdued and tranquil to elicit any significant feeling of anger."
rua-de-barbizon-1879.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The scene depicted is a serene and pastoral landscape, likely a village road winding through lush trees. The figures on the path appear to be casually walking or conversing, displaying no signs of conflict, distress, or aggression. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and calm, reinforced by the soft, naturalistic color palette of greens, browns, and muted sky tones. There are no harsh lines, turbulent brushstrokes, or dramatic contrasts that might suggest agitation or frustration.

rouen-cathedral-sunlight-effect.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is no discernable element within this painting that evokes or communicates the emotion of anger. The color palette, dominated by blues, purples, whites, and varying earth tones, is vibrant and luminous due to the depiction of full sunlight, rather than dark, harsh, or aggressive hues (like deep reds or stark blacks) typically associated with rage or hostility. While the Impressionistic brushwork is thick and textured, creating a sense of movement and the play of light, it does not convey violent or chaotic energy indicative of anger; instead, it meticulously renders the effects of light and atmosphere on the architectural form. The subject matter itself, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, is a grand and static structure, embodying spirituality and architectural splendor, entirely devoid of any narrative or expressive content that would suggest conflict, aggression, or distress. There are no figures expressing anger, no destructive elements, and no visual tension or discord that could be interpreted as an angry sentiment. The overall mood is one of contemplative observation, luminosity, and atmospheric presence, conveying tranquility and the ephemeral beauty of light rather than any form of anger or agitation."

The dominant mood is one of tranquil observation, perhaps a touch of melancholy due to the grey sky and wet streets, but equally a sense of warmth and coziness emanating from the illuminated shop windows. There are no aggressive figures, no signs of conflict, tension, or distress among the people depicted. The colors, while including some reds, are used to convey inviting light rather than agitation or heat.

russian-dancers.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting conveys an overwhelming sense of joy, camaraderie, and natural beauty, leaving no visual cues to suggest anger. The soft pastel medium creates a dreamlike, almost ethereal quality, with blurred lines and harmonious color blending. The figures, likely women, are depicted in what appears to be a graceful dance or a moment of shared celebration in a sunlit field, adorned with vibrant floral wreaths. Their body language is fluid and interlinked, suggesting unity and peace, rather than confrontation or tension. While the faces are not rendered with extreme detail, their general tilt and the overall serene atmosphere preclude any interpretation of angry expressions. There are no sharp, aggressive lines, no clashing or dark colors that typically evoke feelings of rage or hostility.

The scene depicts a quiet street with buildings, rendered with a loose and fluid watercolor technique. The color palette, consisting primarily of muted blues, browns, and grays, with a contrasting but not aggressive red shopfront, contributes to a calm and observational atmosphere rather than one of agitation or hostility. There are no figures expressing anger, no violent or destructive imagery, no harsh or clashing colors, and no agitated brushstrokes that would suggest emotional turmoil or conflict. The overall impression is one of peaceful urban observation, entirely devoid of any resonance with anger."
saint-tropez.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The color palette consists predominantly of muted blues, greys, and earthy tones, which are inherently calming and lack the vibrant, aggressive reds or harsh, contrasting blacks often associated with anger. The brushwork, while visible and textured, is not violent or chaotic; instead, it contributes to an impressionistic rendering of light and atmosphere, suggesting a natural and unforced quality. There are no sharp, jarring lines or turbulent compositions that would convey conflict or aggression. The subject matter itself – old, weathered fishing shacks by a calm body of water with distant mountains and a serene sailboat – speaks to a sense of quietude, perhaps even a humble tranquility, rather than any form of rage or frustration. There are no depicted figures exhibiting angry emotions, nor are there any narrative elements suggesting injustice, struggle, or intense displeasure. The overall mood is one of peaceful observation, far removed from any agitated or hostile sentiment."
south-boston-pier.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is no discernable element within this painting that conveys or evokes the emotion of anger. The scene depicts a lively but calm gathering of individuals, including many women with parasols and children in white dresses, on what appears to be a pier or boardwalk. The figures' stances and interactions are passive and leisurely; no one is shown in a confrontational posture, exhibiting aggressive body language, or displaying any visible signs of agitation or rage. Facial expressions are largely indistinct due to the Impressionistic watercolor style, but none suggest displeasure or anger. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, dominated by earthy tones, and there are no harsh or clashing colors that would imply tension or conflict. The general atmosphere is one of peaceful observation, social interaction, and leisurely enjoyment. The painting lacks any narrative or visual cues such as arguments, violent actions, or distressed expressions that would typically be associated with anger."
spring-1890.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element in this painting that evokes the emotion of anger. The scene depicts a serene and idyllic landscape with a calm river, lush fields, and a bright, clear sky. The colors used are predominantly soft greens, yellows, blues, and earthy reds, all of which contribute to a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere rather than one of discord or aggression. The brushwork is gentle and fluid, characteristic of an impressionistic style, with no harsh lines or jagged strokes that might suggest tension or agitation. The small figures by the water appear to be relaxing or engaged in a quiet activity, showing no signs of distress, conflict, or any angry expressions. There are no stormy skies, turbulent water, or any chaotic elements that could be associated with anger. The overall mood of the painting is one of tranquility, leisure, and natural beauty, diametrically opposed to feelings of anger."
southern-france-beach.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. The scene depicts a serene and leisurely atmosphere, likely a beach or coastal area under clear skies, dominated by large, organic pine trees. The color palette of warm browns, greens, and blues evokes a feeling of peace and natural beauty, rather than agitation or conflict. The human figures, though simplified, appear to be engaged in relaxed activities: one person reclines on the ground, another is seated, and others seem to be casually strolling or standing. There are no aggressive postures, tense interactions, or discernible expressions of rage or frustration on any of the figures. The overall composition is harmonious, with soft lines and a gentle interplay of light and shadow. There are no elements of discord, violence, or injustice depicted that would provoke anger in the viewer or suggest its presence within the painted narrative. The slight non-zero score acknowledges the subjective nature of emotional response, but for all practical purposes, anger is entirely absent from this tranquil portrayal."
spring-at-pontoise-1872.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The emotion of anger is virtually absent from this painting. The scene depicts a serene, rural landscape with houses, trees, and a few figures under a partly cloudy sky. There are no elements within the composition that suggest anger, aggression, conflict, or distress. The colors are muted and natural, consisting of earthy browns and greens, white and beige for the buildings, and a calming blue for the sky. There are no harsh, clashing, or fiery colors typically associated with anger. The brushwork, while visible and typical of the Impressionist style, is not agitated, chaotic, or violent in a way that would convey emotional turmoil or rage. The figures are small and appear engaged in everyday, peaceful activities (one working in a garden, two walking), with no discernible angry expressions or postures. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet observation, tranquility, or perhaps a gentle melancholy due to the bare trees, but it is entirely devoid of any sense of fury, irritation, or resentment. The stable composition and natural light further contribute to a sense of peace rather than any unsettling emotion like anger."
spring-morning.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting conveys a profound sense of tranquility and natural harmony, rather than any feeling of anger. The subject matter itself – a serene landscape featuring calm water, rolling hills, and scattered trees under an overcast sky – is inherently peaceful. There are no elements within the composition that suggest conflict, aggression, tension, or any form of hostility. The colors are natural and harmonious, consisting primarily of earthy browns, greens, blues, and muted yellows, all contributing to a quiet, contemplative atmosphere. There are no jarring reds, sharp contrasts, or violent brushstrokes that might evoke a sense of rage or fury. The visible brushwork, while expressive, appears controlled and used to convey light and texture rather than an agitated emotional state. The smooth, reflective surface of the water, the gentle slopes of the hills, and the diffuse light all contribute to an overall mood of calm and stillness, completely devoid of any indication of anger."
spring-morning-pontoise-1874.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter, a serene rural landscape with trees, fields, and a few animals, is inherently peaceful and idyllic. There are no visual cues that suggest conflict, frustration, aggression, or any form of hostility. The colors are predominantly calming greens and blues, with earthy tones, which are universally associated with nature and tranquility, rather than intense negative emotions. The light appears soft and natural, contributing to an overall gentle atmosphere. The brushwork, characteristic of an impressionistic style, is loose and expressive, but it serves to capture the ephemeral quality of light and atmosphere, not to convey internal turmoil or outward rage. There are no harsh lines, jarring compositions, or disturbing elements that might provoke a feeling of anger in the viewer. The figures present are small and integrated into the landscape, appearing to be engaged in everyday, non-confrontational activities. The entire scene communicates a sense of calm and natural harmony, directly opposing any emotional resonance with anger."
sky-at-sunset.jpg,impressionism,55.0,"The depiction of anger in this painting is not overt or narrative, but rather conveyed through the raw, energetic, and turbulent visual language employed by the artist. The most significant contributor to a sense of anger is the vigorous and expressive brushwork, particularly in the sky. The thick, visible strokes are applied with a forceful quality, creating a sense of agitation and unrest. This raw application of paint, almost like a flurry of furious gestures, embodies an intense, untamed energy that can be associated with the physical manifestation of anger.

Furthermore, the palette, while featuring warm oranges and yellows indicative of a sunset or sunrise, is heavily interspersed with dark, brooding browns, grays, and purplish-blacks in the cloud formations. These darker, heavier tones contribute to an oppressive and stormy atmosphere, which can feel menacing or fraught with tension. The dramatic contrast between the lighter, almost fiery patches and the deep, shadowed areas enhances this sense of turmoil and internal strife. There is a weight and a pressure from the sky that could evoke feelings of frustration or a brewing tempest, mirroring an angry state. While no figures display anger, the sheer force and chaotic beauty of the depicted natural scene, rendered with such dynamic and almost aggressive brushstrokes, resonate with the powerful and sometimes destructive energy associated with anger. It's an anger derived from the raw, unbridled power of nature, rather than explicit human emotion."
still-life-with-pomegranates.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a still life by Renoir, exhibits absolutely no elements that could evoke or suggest anger. The subject matter itself—a bowl overflowing with ripe fruits and scattered nuts on a draped tablecloth—is inherently peaceful and bountiful. The color palette is warm and harmonious, dominated by soft yellows, rich reds, and earthy greens, all blending seamlessly without any jarring contrasts or aggressive tones. Renoir's characteristic Impressionistic brushwork is soft and gentle, creating rounded forms and a diffused, tranquil light that permeates the scene. There are no sharp lines, chaotic compositions, or unsettling distortions; instead, the arrangement feels natural and inviting. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of domestic serenity, abundance, and quiet beauty. Every aspect of the painting, from its comforting subject to its soft execution and pleasant color scheme, actively contributes to a sense of calm and contentment, placing it at the furthest possible remove from any feeling of anger or agitation. The score of 0.5 is assigned merely to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of any human emotional response, no matter how remote, rather than an absolute zero, which is practically impossible for any human experience."
strand-in-trouville-1863.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this painting that elicits or represents anger. The scene depicts a serene and leisurely day at the beach, with figures engaged in relaxed activities such as strolling, conversing, and horseback riding. The palette, composed of soft blues, grays, and warm sandy tones, contributes to a calm and tranquil atmosphere, devoid of any harsh or clashing colors that might evoke irritation or aggression. Figures are rendered without any signs of distress, conflict, or violent action; their postures and interactions appear peaceful. There are no dramatic or unsettling compositional choices, nor any symbolic elements that might hint at underlying tension or fury. The overall impression is one of peaceful observation and everyday life, leaving no room for an emotional response of anger."
street-from-bretania-1.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits or suggests anger. The scene depicts a quiet, sun-drenched street with buildings, rendered in a soft, impressionistic style. The color palette is dominated by warm yellows, oranges, and soft browns, with touches of muted green and light gray, all contributing to a sense of warmth and peacefulness. The light is gentle and inviting, casting soft shadows. There are no figures, no dramatic events, no harsh lines, no clashing colors, and no turbulent skies or unsettling elements that could be interpreted as a reflection or source of anger. The brushwork is soft and painterly, further reinforcing a calm and serene atmosphere. The overall impression is one of tranquility and quiet charm, diametrically opposed to any feeling of anger."
summertime.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes a strong sense of peace, tranquility, and natural beauty, diametrically opposite to any feelings of anger. The serene garden setting, bathed in soft light, features a solitary figure calmly observing the flowers. There are no elements within the composition—such as harsh colors, turbulent lines, distorted figures, or narrative cues suggesting conflict or distress—that would induce or reflect anger. The clear blue sky, the vibrant but gentle hues of the flowers and foliage (white roses, yellow sunflowers), and the relaxed posture of the person all contribute to an overwhelming feeling of calm and contentment. There is an absolute absence of any visual tension, aggression, or frustration, leading to a score of 0 for anger."
still-life-with-flowers-skull-and-oak-leaves-1915.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"As an art expert observing this still life painting, I find absolutely no visual elements or emotional resonance that would evoke or represent anger. The composition features a traditional arrangement of fruits, including apples, pears, grapes, and perhaps gourds or other produce, neatly placed on a platter and table. The brushwork, while visible and expressive, is not aggressive, chaotic, or agitated in a manner that would convey hostility or fury. Rather, it contributes to the texture and vitality of the forms. The color palette, composed of warm yellows, oranges, reds, and deep greens, alongside the dark background, is harmonious and inviting, typical of still life subjects, and contains no jarring or clashing hues that might suggest conflict or irritation. There are no broken objects, no violent gestures, no disturbing lighting, or any narrative hints of discord. The painting exudes a sense of abundance, natural beauty, and a quiet, contemplative atmosphere. Therefore, in the complete absence of any visual cues or psychological undercurrents that could be interpreted as anger, the score is zero."
strong-wind-gust-of-wind.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a vibrant landscape, evokes feelings of serenity, natural beauty, and calm, but absolutely no sense of anger. The color palette consists predominantly of soft blues in the sky and various harmonious greens in the hills and foliage, which are inherently peaceful and soothing tones. There are no harsh, jarring, or agitated colors such as aggressive reds or deep, ominous purples that might be associated with anger or conflict. The brushstrokes, while visible and dynamic in capturing the light and movement typical of Impressionism, are fluid and descriptive of natural forms, not jagged, violent, or chaotic in a way that would convey rage or turmoil. The white clouds are depicted as light and airy, not dark, storm-laden, or oppressive. The subject matter itself – a verdant, rolling landscape under an open sky – is devoid of any narrative elements, figures, or symbolic representations that could suggest frustration, aggression, or any form of emotional disturbance. The composition is open and inviting, leading the eye across the gentle slopes and into the expansive sky, fostering a sense of tranquility rather than confrontation. There is a complete absence of tension, aggression, or any visual cues that could be interpreted as anger within this work."
summer-1896.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting presents a scene overwhelmingly characterized by peace, innocence, and leisurely enjoyment, offering absolutely no visual cues or narrative elements that would evoke or represent anger. The figures, predominantly children and some adults, are depicted in various states of playful interaction and relaxation within calm, shallow water. Their postures are open and unthreatened, with children either wading, sitting in the gentle waves, or being guided by the adults. There are no furrowed brows, clenched fists, tense muscles, or any body language indicative of frustration, aggression, or conflict. The adults appear to be tenderly caring for the younger children, reinforcing a sense of nurturing and safety. The overall atmosphere is one of serene recreation, further emphasized by the soft light, tranquil water, and harmonious color palette, all of which strongly contradict any notion of anger. The composition is balanced and unchaotic, and there is an undeniable sense of quiet joy and contentment permeating the entire image, leaving no room for the emotion of anger."
the-beach-at-trouville-1869.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, ""Beach Scene"" by Eugène Boudin, evokes a sense of tranquil observation rather than any strong emotional turmoil. There is absolutely no discernible element within the composition, subject matter, or artistic execution that conveys or inspires anger. The figures on the beach are engaged in calm interaction or quiet contemplation, their postures relaxed and non-confrontational. There are no agitated forms, aggressive gestures, or distressed facial expressions (though details are impressionistic). The subdued color palette, dominated by blues, grays, and muted earth tones, creates an atmospheric but placid mood, devoid of the harsh, vibrant, or clashing colors often used to convey strong negative emotions like anger. The weather, while perhaps overcast, does not appear threatening or turbulent in a way that would suggest rage or frustration. The overall impression is one of quiet leisure and a gentle depiction of everyday life at the seaside, utterly lacking any undertones of hostility, resentment, or ire."
tennis-game-by-the-sea-1901.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a scene of a tennis match, likely recreational, featuring several individuals. There are absolutely no visual cues within the artwork to suggest anger. The figures' postures are relaxed and engaged in the sport, not tense or aggressive. The facial expressions, though not highly detailed, do not convey any form of displeasure or confrontation. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of calm leisure, with soft colors and a seemingly overcast but peaceful sky. There is no dynamic tension, harsh lighting, or discordant elements in the composition that would evoke or represent anger. The interaction between the players appears cooperative and part of the game, rather than competitive in an aggressive sense. A score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any human scene *could* contain subtle, unperceived anger, but from an objective artistic assessment, there is genuinely nothing within the depicted elements to indicate this emotion."
sunset-1.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting predominantly evokes feelings of tranquility, serenity, and natural beauty, depicting a sunrise or sunset over a calm body of water with distant landmasses. There are no visual cues or artistic choices within the composition that would elicit or convey anger. The color palette, while featuring warm oranges and reds in the sky and their reflection, utilizes these hues to create a soft, luminous glow characteristic of dawn or dusk, not a jarring or aggressive burst of color. These warm tones are balanced by the cool, placid blues and greens of the water, contributing to an overall sense of harmony and peace. The brushstrokes, though visible and expressive, contribute to a dynamic yet gentle portrayal of light and reflection, lacking any harshness, abruptness, or chaotic energy that might suggest agitation or fury. The subject matter itself—a peaceful landscape—offers no narrative elements, figures, or symbolic representations typically associated with conflict, frustration, or wrath. The composition guides the eye smoothly through the scene, fostering a contemplative rather than an confrontational or distressed emotional response. Consequently, the emotion of anger is virtually absent from this artwork."
the-cascade.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a natural landscape featuring a waterfall and a flowing stream. There are no elements within the artwork that evoke or suggest anger. The subject matter itself – a natural scene – is inherently devoid of emotions like rage or aggression. The colors used are predominantly naturalistic blues, whites, greens, and earthy browns and yellows, none of which are typically associated with anger. There are no harsh reds or clashing, dissonant colors that might convey a sense of agitation or fury. While the brushstrokes are dynamic and convey the powerful movement of water, this energy is interpreted as the natural force and beauty of the waterfall, not as a destructive or aggressive force. There are no figures, objects, or compositional choices that hint at conflict, frustration, or any form of hostile emotion. The overall impression is one of natural vigor and flow, rather than any negative or volatile sentiment. Therefore, the emotion of anger is completely absent from this artwork."
the-clearing-in-the-woods-1913.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a serene winter landscape, elicits feelings of tranquility, peace, and perhaps a sense of quiet solitude, but absolutely no anger. There are no elements within the composition, color palette, or subject matter that would evoke such an emotion. The scene depicts a peaceful snowy valley, bathed in soft light and shadow, with a lone figure on a horse-drawn sleigh, suggesting everyday life or work in a calm environment. The bare trees and snow-covered ground speak of winter's embrace, not of conflict or agitation. The blues and purples of the shadows, contrasted with the warm yellows and oranges of the sunlit areas, create a harmonious and contemplative mood. There are no harsh lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or distressing imagery that could be associated with anger. The overall impression is one of calm beauty and stillness, entirely devoid of any indication of rage, frustration, or hostility."
the-bathing-hour-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, depicting a vibrant waterfront scene filled with people engaged in leisure activities, evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The overall atmosphere is one of serene enjoyment and calm. The colors are bright and cheerful, dominated by lively blues of the water, warm greens of the land, and sunny yellows, all contributing to an uplifting mood rather than any sense of discord or hostility. The figures, whether swimming, boating, socializing on the dock, or walking along the shore, exhibit relaxed postures and appear to be engaged in pleasant, recreational pursuits. There are no clenched fists, furrowed brows, confrontational stances, or aggressive gestures visible anywhere in the composition. No element within the scene suggests conflict, injustice, frustration, or distress. Instead, the scene is idyllic and peaceful, portraying a harmonious interaction between people and their environment. The absence of any visual cues typically associated with anger, such as tension, agitation, or discontent, leads to a score of 0.0, indicating a complete lack of this emotion in the painting's narrative and aesthetic impact."
the-cowherd.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no visual indication of anger in this painting, neither conveyed by the subjects within the artwork nor evoked in the viewer. The scene is one of serene pastoral tranquility, depicting a cow grazing in a field and a woman quietly observing or engaged in a calm activity in the background. The colors are soft and natural, primarily greens and blues, which contribute to a peaceful and gentle atmosphere, entirely devoid of the harshness or intensity often associated with anger. The brushwork, while impressionistic, is not agitated or violent. There are no aggressive postures, threatening gestures, or distressed expressions from either the animal or the human figure. The overall composition is harmonious and balanced, lacking any elements of conflict, tension, or frustration that might suggest anger. The painting instead invites a sense of calm contemplation and a quiet appreciation of rural life."
the-coastguard-cabin-at-varengeville.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting, an Impressionistic landscape, registers an almost complete absence of anger. The color palette is dominated by soft, luminous shades of white, lavender, green, and blues, which contribute to an overall sense of tranquility and light rather than any form of agitation or harshness. There are no sharp, discordant color juxtapositions or jarring contrasts that might evoke a feeling of aggression or internal turmoil. The brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, is loose, feathery, and gentle, conveying atmosphere and light rather than forceful or violent energy. There are no aggressive lines, violent movements, or chaotic compositions that might visually translate to anger. The subject matter—a peaceful hillside adorned with blossoming flora, a solitary dwelling, and the calm expanse of the sea or sky—is inherently serene and contemplative. There are no human figures or narratives of conflict, struggle, or distress present to suggest this emotion. The entire visual experience is one of quiet beauty, harmony, and natural grace, providing no visual cues or emotional resonance that would align with anger in any significant way. The score is not an absolute zero only because an absolute absence of any human emotional projection into an artwork is theoretically impossible, but practically speaking, this painting is diametrically opposed to the feeling of anger."
the-coast-at-sainte-adresse.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting conveys virtually no sense of anger. The scene depicts a serene, albeit cloudy, coastal landscape with boats on the water and a stretch of beach bordered by cliffs. There are no visual cues that suggest rage, frustration, or hostility. The colors are muted and earthy, dominated by warm yellows, ochres, greens, and grays, which evoke a calm, natural atmosphere rather than one of conflict or agitation. The sky, while heavy with clouds, does not appear menacing or storm-ridden in an aggressive way; rather, it suggests an overcast day or the soft light of dusk. The figures in the boat are small and indistinguishable, offering no indication of distress or angry emotion. The water's surface shows gentle ripples, not violent waves. There is no depiction of struggle, destruction, or any element that could be interpreted as a manifestation of anger, either from nature or from any human presence within the scene. The overall mood is one of tranquility and quiet observation, placing the emotion of anger at an extremely negligible level."
the-greenhouse-1876.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, an impressionistic rendering of a vibrant garden, offers absolutely no visual cues or thematic elements that would evoke anger. The color palette is dominated by lush greens, soft blues in the sky, and an abundance of cheerful reds, pinks, and whites from the blooming roses. These colors, applied with loose, expressive brushstrokes typical of Impressionism, convey light, life, and natural beauty, rather than any sense of discord or aggression. The subject matter itself – an idyllic garden path winding through abundant floral growth, with a solitary figure seemingly at peace within nature – inherently promotes feelings of tranquility, beauty, and quiet contemplation. There are no harsh lines, turbulent compositions, or dynamic tensions that might suggest conflict or frustration. The scene is calm, inviting, and harmonious, entirely devoid of any visual or narrative elements that could be interpreted as expressing rage, resentment, or any form of hostile emotion. The overall atmosphere is one of serene beauty and gentle observation, antithetical to the emotion of anger."
the-lady-pianist.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting displays absolutely no visual cues or thematic elements that would evoke anger. The scene depicts a woman elegantly engrossed in playing a musical instrument within a richly decorated, serene setting. Her posture is relaxed and focused, her expression, though partially obscured, appears tranquil or contemplative, not strained or agitated. The soft, harmonious color palette, the intricate but peaceful room decor, and the overall quiet intimacy of the moment all contribute to an atmosphere of calm and beauty. There are no tense lines, jarring colors, signs of conflict, disarray, or any aggressive or frustrated body language. The discarded piece of fabric on the chair and floor suggests perhaps a casual intimacy or preparation, but certainly not anger. The small white flower on the floor further emphasizes a delicate, peaceful ambiance. Without any discernible visual indication of anger, frustration, tension, or conflict, the emotion of anger is effectively absent from this artwork. A score of 0.5 is given, rather than a flat 0, to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any human experience, even one depicted as outwardly peaceful, might contain some infinitesimal, unperceivable trace of an emotion, but in practical interpretation, anger is entirely absent."
the-japanese-bridge-the-water-lily-pond-1899.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, Claude Monet's ""The Water Lily Pond,"" overwhelmingly exudes a sense of peace, tranquility, and natural beauty. The dominant colors are lush greens and serene blues, which are inherently calming and associated with nature, growth, and water, rather than any form of agitation or hostility. The subject matter itself – a gentle Japanese footbridge arching gracefully over a pond filled with delicate water lilies – is idyllic and devoid of any elements that could be perceived as threatening, aggressive, or chaotic. The soft, dappled light and the characteristic Impressionistic brushstrokes create a shimmering, ethereal quality that further enhances the sense of calm and contemplation. There are no sharp lines, discordant colors, harsh forms, or dramatic tension that might trigger an angry emotional response. No figures are present, nor any implied conflict or distress. The composition is balanced and harmonious. The very slight non-zero score (0.5) is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an extremely idiosyncratic and unlikely viewer reaction, perhaps from a deep-seated personal aversion to peace or nature, but objectively, the painting offers absolutely no visual or thematic cues that would evoke anger in a typical viewer."
the-moret-bridge-1888.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicted is a serene and peaceful landscape featuring a river, a bridge, and lush trees, with some distant buildings. The color palette consists of soft greens, earthy browns, and muted grays in the sky, which are harmonious and calming, entirely devoid of harsh or aggressive tones often associated with anger. The brushwork, though visible and textural, is not chaotic, agitated, or violent; rather, it contributes to the tranquil, natural ambiance. There are no dramatic or unsettling elements in the composition – no stormy skies, no destructive forces, no scenes of conflict or injustice. The few small figures near the building appear to be resting or engaged in quiet activity, displaying no signs of distress, confrontation, or any emotion akin to anger. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation and natural beauty, which is antithetical to feelings of anger. There is simply nothing within the visual language of the artwork that would elicit or represent this emotion."
the-reading-1869.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, ""The Balcony"" by Édouard Manet, presents a scene devoid of any discernible signs of anger. The seated woman, the primary subject, displays a remarkably calm and composed demeanor. Her facial expression is neutral, perhaps pensive, with no furrowing of the brow, tightening of the lips, or narrowing of the eyes that would typically indicate displeasure or hostility. Her gaze is direct but not confrontational or agitated. Her body language further reinforces this absence of anger; she is seated in a relaxed posture, her hands resting gently, one on her lap and the other on the armrest, conveying a sense of ease rather than tension or aggression. There are no clenched fists, rigid shoulders, or leaning forward aggressively. The man standing behind her also shows no signs of anger; his focus appears to be on a book or papers, and his posture is unthreatening. The overall atmosphere of the scene is tranquil and domestic, bathed in soft light filtered through the curtains, which does not evoke any sense of discord or strong negative emotion. The color palette is subdued, dominated by whites, grays, and greens, lacking the harshness or intensity often associated with a depiction of anger. There is simply no visual cue or narrative element within the painting that suggests anger from any of the figures or within the painted environment itself."
the-louvre-1902.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, an Impressionistic cityscape, presents a tranquil and atmospheric view of the Seine River in Paris during what appears to be a cool, perhaps winter, day. There are virtually no visual elements within the composition that evoke feelings of anger. The color palette is composed of soft blues, grays, muted browns, and subtle peach tones in the sky, none of which are typically associated with rage or hostility. There are no harsh, aggressive reds or jarring contrasts. The brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, is broken and textural, but it conveys a sense of light and atmospheric movement rather than agitation or violence.

The subject matter itself – a river scene with a bridge, distant buildings (likely the Louvre), and small figures engaged in everyday activities – is inherently peaceful and observational. There is no depiction of conflict, struggle, injustice, or any overt sign of human or environmental distress. The figures are small and indistinct, offering no discernible emotional cues of frustration or aggression. Even the steamboat, with its plume of smoke, is depicted as an ordinary element of urban life, not as a symbol of aggressive industry or pollution. The bare trees on the left suggest winter, which can sometimes evoke a sense of starkness, but this does not translate into anger. The overall mood is contemplative, calm, and perhaps slightly melancholic due to the season, but utterly devoid of any visual or thematic tension that would lead to a sensation of anger in the viewer. The score of 0.5 reflects an almost complete absence of this emotion."
the-thaw-eragny-1893.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a winter landscape, evokes feelings of tranquility, stillness, and perhaps a subtle sense of stark beauty associated with the season. The dominant colors are cool whites, blues, and greys, with the dark, intricate branches of the central tree providing strong contrast. There are no elements within the composition, subject matter, or color palette that suggest anger. The bare tree, while prominent, is depicted naturally, not menacingly. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation or a serene observation of nature, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger an emotional response of anger. There are no figures, no conflict, no aggressive forms, and no jarring color combinations that would imply such an emotion."
the-valley-of-the-scie-at-pouville.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes a profound sense of tranquility and natural harmony, leaving no room for the emotion of anger. The soft, muted color palette, dominated by earthy greens, browns, and serene blues for the water and sky, inherently communicates a peaceful and settled atmosphere rather than any agitation or discord. There are no vibrant, clashing reds or oranges that might signify passion, aggression, or conflict, nor are there stark contrasts or jarring elements in the composition.

The subject matter itself—a pastoral landscape featuring a calm river flowing through fields towards distant hills, with what appear to be grazing animals and a solitary dwelling—is inherently benign and idyllic. There are no figures depicted in distress, no signs of violence or struggle, no natural phenomena suggesting wrath (like a furious storm or raging fire). The overall scene is one of quiet contemplation and stillness.

Furthermore, the artist's brushwork, while impressionistic and loose, does not convey any sense of forceful or agitated application that could translate into emotional turmoil. Instead, it suggests a gentle observation of light and form, contributing to the overall serene mood. The composition is balanced and open, inviting the viewer into a space of quietude, entirely devoid of any visual cues that might trigger or represent anger. Thus, from every visual aspect—color, subject, composition, and execution—anger is completely absent from this artistic expression."
the-tenth-street-studio-1915.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, an interior scene depicting figures and numerous art objects, evokes a predominantly calm and contemplative atmosphere, offering virtually no visual cues that would suggest or provoke anger. The figures, a woman seen from the back and a man conversing or observing, display relaxed postures devoid of any tension, aggression, or confrontational stances. Their interactions appear benign, contributing to a sense of quiet engagement rather than any form of discord. The animals present – a dog standing calmly and another creature resting on the floor – also exhibit peaceful demeanors, further reinforcing the absence of agitation.

The color palette is composed of soft, earthy tones, muted reds, greens, and browns, with a significant presence of white in the woman's dress and table coverings. These colors, along with the gentle lighting, contribute to a harmonious and inviting environment, rather than one that feels volatile or hostile. There are no sharp, clashing colors or abrupt contrasts that might signify emotional turmoil or aggression.

Furthermore, the composition is balanced and orderly, despite the richness of the details and objects displayed throughout the room. There are no chaotic lines, violent imagery, or any narrative elements that imply conflict, frustration, or rage. The brushwork, characteristic of an impressionistic style, is soft and fluid, creating a sense of quiet reflection rather than sharp, impactful confrontation. The overall impression is one of domestic peace or a leisurely visit, entirely devoid of any undercurrent of anger, resentment, or hostility. The score of 0.5 acknowledges the absolute impossibility of a perfect zero in subjective interpretation, but strongly conveys the near-total absence of this emotion within the artwork."
the-valley-of-sasso-sunshine.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, ""Bordighera"" by Claude Monet, exhibits no visual cues or thematic elements that would evoke or represent anger. The palette consists primarily of lush greens, warm yellows, and varied earth tones, including some vibrant reddish-orange hues in the foreground foliage. These colors contribute to a sense of natural beauty and warmth rather than any feeling of aggression or agitation. The brushstrokes are characteristic of Impressionism, appearing loose and expressive, capturing the play of light and the texture of the vegetation, but they do not convey a sense of violent energy, frustration, or turmoil. The subject matter itself – a verdant landscape with palm trees and a building nestled within – is inherently peaceful and devoid of any human or natural conflict. There are no harsh lines, jarring contrasts, or distorted forms that might suggest distress or rage. The overall atmosphere is one of serene abundance and a tranquil observation of nature, which stands in stark opposition to the emotion of anger. Any score above zero would only account for the extremely remote possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly abstract personal association, but objectively, the painting contains nothing to suggest this emotion."
tree-in-the-farm-yard-1874.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The scene depicts a quiet, rural or semi-rural setting with houses and a large tree under a cloudy sky. The colors are muted and natural, dominated by browns, greens, and a pale blue-grey. There are no harsh contrasts, jarring compositions, or dynamic elements that would suggest conflict, aggression, or distress. The figures, though small and indistinct, appear to be engaged in everyday activities, and their postures or interactions do not convey any negative emotions. The overall atmosphere is one of calm, perhaps even a gentle melancholy or peaceful observation, but certainly not anger. There are no visual cues—be it through brushwork, color choices, subject matter, or narrative—that hint at any underlying tension, frustration, or rage. The painting is entirely devoid of elements that could be interpreted as angry or anger-inducing."
the-pont-neuf-1902.jpg,impressionism,1.0,"The painting, depicting a bustling Parisian street scene, conveys an overwhelming sense of urban dynamism and activity rather than anger. There are no visual cues within the artwork to suggest anger as an emotion. The myriad figures on the bridge are rendered in a generalized manner; none display discernible expressions or postures indicative of aggression, conflict, or rage. The horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians move about in a seemingly orderly, albeit dense, flow, typical of a busy city thoroughfare, without any implied collisions or altercations.

Furthermore, the color palette is generally bright and warm, dominated by blues, whites, and light grays in the sky, and warm ochres, browns, and muted greens for the buildings, bridge, and ground. There is an absence of the intense, jarring reds or deep, turbulent blacks often associated with feelings of anger or turmoil in art. The brushstrokes, characteristic of Impressionism, are lively and textural, contributing to the sense of movement and light, but they do not convey harshness, violence, or emotional distress. The overall atmosphere is one of vibrant, active life, an observation of the city's pulse, rather than an expression of negative emotions. While large crowds can sometimes induce feelings of frustration in real life, the painting itself does not translate this potential into a visually tangible form of anger; it simply presents the scene as it is, bustling and full of life."
tulip-fields-at-sassenheim-near-leiden-1886.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, an Impressionistic landscape, evokes feelings of serenity, joy, and the beauty of nature rather than any sense of anger. The color palette consists of soft blues for the sky, various shades of green and vibrant reds, pinks, yellows, and whites for the cultivated fields, all contributing to a harmonious and pleasant visual experience. There are no sharp, clashing colors or dark, ominous tones that might suggest hostility or agitation. The subject matter itself—a quaint thatched cottage amidst blooming tulip fields under a bright sky—is inherently peaceful and picturesque. There are no figures depicted, nor any signs of conflict, destruction, or disarray. The brushstrokes, while visible and dynamic, are used to capture light and atmosphere, not to convey aggression or turmoil. The overall composition is open and inviting, leading the eye across the colorful fields to the rustic dwelling, fostering a sense of calm and appreciation for the rural scene. Consequently, there are no visual cues or thematic elements within this artwork that could reasonably be interpreted as eliciting or representing anger."
two-women-on-the-hillside-1906.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that convey or elicit the emotion of anger. The scene depicts two figures, likely women, in a serene natural landscape, engaged in what appears to be leisure or quiet contemplation. The colors used are predominantly soft greens, yellows, whites, and light blues, which are associated with nature, calm, and peace, rather than aggression or conflict. The brushwork, while thick and visible, creates a vibrant and textured surface that speaks to the immediate experience of light and form, not emotional turmoil. The figures' postures are relaxed; one is seated facing away, gazing into the distance, and the other is reclined, suggesting comfort and repose. There are no sharp lines, clashing colors, agitated forms, or discernible facial expressions (the faces are abstracted) that would indicate distress, frustration, or any form of anger. The overall impression is one of tranquility and harmony, making any association with anger entirely absent."
untitled-1885.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a harbor scene with sailing ships under a cloudy sky, conveys no discernible sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter itself—a bustling yet serene port—is inherently devoid of elements that would typically evoke this emotion. There are no depictions of conflict, struggle, or distress among the vessels or the implied human presence. The colors are predominantly soft blues, grays, and earthy tones, which contribute to a calm and almost contemplative atmosphere, rather than any intensity or agitation associated with anger. Furthermore, the brushstrokes, characteristic of an impressionistic style, are loose and fluid, lacking the sharp, jagged, or aggressive quality that might visually translate to a feeling of ire or frustration. The composition is balanced and harmonious, presenting an orderly view of maritime activity without any chaotic or turbulent elements that could be interpreted as a manifestation of anger. The overall mood is one of tranquility and quiet industry, making the presence of anger completely incongruous with the visual evidence."
two-vases-with-chrysanthems.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element in Claude Monet's ""Chrysanthemums"" that evokes the emotion of anger. The painting depicts two lush, vibrant bouquets of chrysanthemums in vases, rendered in the artist's characteristic Impressionistic style. The subject matter itself—flowers—is inherently associated with beauty, nature, growth, and often, serenity or celebration, which are antithetical to anger. The color palette, dominated by warm yellows, whites, pinks, and harmonious purples and blues, against a rich reddish-brown background, conveys warmth, light, and vitality rather than any sense of aggression or tension. The brushstrokes are loose, dynamic, and expressive, capturing the texture and light on the petals, but they are not harsh, jagged, or violent in a way that would suggest an angry hand or an angry subject. The composition is balanced and full, contributing to a feeling of abundance and natural grace, not agitation or conflict. There are no figures expressing distress, no chaotic or destructive elements, and no visual cues that would lead one to interpret anger in this tranquil and beautiful still life.

trees-in-bloom-1889.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes a profound sense of tranquility, natural beauty, and the quiet rhythm of life, making any association with anger nearly impossible. There are absolutely no visual cues within the composition, color palette, or subject matter that would incite or represent anger. The dominant colors are soft blues of the sky, verdant greens of the foliage, and the gentle whites of blossoms, all of which are harmonious and soothing, starkly contrasting with the harsh, aggressive, or chaotic tones often linked with anger. The scene depicts a serene spring landscape, likely an orchard in bloom, with a few figures engaged in what appears to be peaceful agricultural labor. The brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, is light and airy, conveying the shimmering quality of light and the freshness of spring, rather than any agitated or violent energy. There are no sharp, confrontational lines, no distorted or menacing forms, and no expressions of rage or frustration on the figures present. The overall atmosphere is one of calm, growth, and natural harmony, directly opposing the turbulent and destructive nature of anger. The painting offers a moment of peaceful contemplation, completely devoid of any element that could be interpreted as hostile, furious, or even slightly agitated."
valencia-landscape-1894.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. Its subject matter, a serene landscape viewed from a garden or terrace, is inherently peaceful and tranquil. The color palette consists of calming greens, soft browns, and light sky tones, with accents of gentle pink and red from the roses, none of which are harsh or aggressive. The composition is balanced and inviting, drawing the viewer's eye across a lush, harmonious scene without any elements of discord or conflict. There are no figures expressing negative emotions, no symbols of violence or destruction, and no chaotic or unsettling brushwork that might suggest agitation or frustration.

The visible, textured brushwork, while energetic, contributes to a sense of vitality and immediate observation rather than aggression or violent emotional outpouring. The overall composition is balanced and inviting, creating a serene and perhaps even contemplative mood. There are no visual elements such as sharp, menacing lines, chaotic arrangements, or dark, oppressive imagery that would typically be associated with feelings of anger, frustration, or rage. The painting's essence is one of calm observation and aesthetic appreciation, leaving no room for an interpretation of anger."
valley-bouna-near-bordighera.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The scene depicts a serene and tranquil mountain landscape under a bright, cloud-dotted sky. The color palette, dominated by soothing blues and a range of natural greens, contributes to a peaceful atmosphere, completely devoid of the harsh, intense, or clashing hues often associated with anger. There are no aggressive reds, deep, oppressive blacks, or jarring contrasts that might suggest rage or turmoil.

The brushstrokes are loose and painterly, characteristic of Impressionism, conveying light and texture in a gentle manner rather than with force or violence. There are no sharp, chaotic lines or compositions that could imply conflict or distress. The subject matter itself—a peaceful vista of nature with small, harmoniously integrated structures—lacks any elements of struggle, destruction, or confrontational themes. There are no human figures expressing anger, no stormy weather, and no visual narratives that hint at any form of aggression or displeasure. The overall impression is one of calm, quiet beauty, rendering the emotion of anger entirely absent from the viewing experience."
villa-with-orange-trees-nice.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, an impressionistic landscape, presents a scene entirely devoid of any elements that could provoke anger. The subject matter—a tranquil setting featuring a house nestled amidst abundant green foliage and orange trees under a soft, perhaps overcast, sky—lacks any indication of conflict, injustice, threat, or disquiet. The color palette is composed of soothing greens, warm oranges, and gentle blues, which are inherently calming and natural, rather than conveying any intensity, aggression, or heat typically associated with anger. Furthermore, the loose, atmospheric brushwork contributes to a sense of peacefulness and natural beauty, rather than agitation or sharp tension. There are no distorted forms, violent actions, confrontational figures, or oppressive atmospheres.

water-lilies-1899-1.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting, one of Claude Monet's iconic Water Lilies series, evokes feelings of serenity, tranquility, and aesthetic beauty. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest or provoke anger. The subject matter – water lilies floating peacefully on a pond – is inherently calm and natural, devoid of any narrative or depiction of conflict, struggle, or distress that might elicit an angry response. The color palette consists predominantly of cool blues and greens, with soft whites and delicate hints of orange in the lily centers. These cool, harmonious tones are traditionally associated with peace and contemplation, not with the heightened emotional state of anger, which often manifests through harsh contrasts, sharp lines, or aggressive warm colors (like reds or oranges used in an unsettling way). The Impressionistic brushstrokes are fluid, gentle, and atmospheric, designed to capture the subtle play of light and reflection on water, rather than conveying any sense of aggression or agitation. The composition is balanced and reflective, further contributing to a sense of calm rather than chaos or tension. There is absolutely nothing in the painting's visual language – its subject, colors, form, or brushwork – that could be interpreted as angry or as a catalyst for anger in the viewer. The slight non-zero score acknowledges the theoretical possibility of a subjective, highly idiosyncratic, or perhaps even an unintentional or misattributed feeling, but practically, this painting is the antithesis of anger."
vene-ia-santa-maria-della-salute-1931.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The scene, depicting a serene canal with architectural elements, likely in Venice, is inherently peaceful and picturesque.

The color palette, dominated by light blues, soft yellows, and earthy browns, is harmonious and calming, entirely lacking the harsh reds, deep aggressive blacks, or jarring contrasts often associated with anger. The watercolor medium itself, with its characteristic fluidity and transparency, lends itself to a softer, more tranquil aesthetic rather than one of intensity or aggression. The brushwork, though loose and impressionistic, conveys a sense of light and atmosphere rather than tension or agitated energy. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation or idyllic charm, completely devoid of any visual cues that might trigger or reflect anger in the viewer. Any minimal dark elements or rough textures are stylistic choices inherent to the medium and do not carry an emotional charge of hostility or fury."
view-of-the-thames-charing-cross-bridge-1874.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, an Impressionist landscape depicting a river scene, evokes a profound sense of tranquility and atmospheric calm, with absolutely no visual elements that would suggest or provoke anger. The predominant color palette of soft blues, grays, and muted browns creates a cool, hazy, and peaceful ambiance, starkly contrasting with the vibrant, aggressive, or chaotic hues often associated with anger. The brushwork, while characteristic of Impressionism, is applied in a manner that creates a gentle, diffused light and a misty atmosphere, particularly in the sky and across the water, contributing to a serene rather than agitated mood. There are no sharp angles, jarring compositions, or harsh contrasts that might convey aggression or discomfort. The subject matter—boats navigating a river, a distant city skyline with landmarks like St. Paul's Cathedral, and a bridge—is depicted with a quiet observational quality. There are no figures expressing rage or distress, no scenes of conflict, and no symbolic imagery that could be interpreted as a source of anger. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and atmospheric beauty, leaving no room for the emotion of anger."
vase-of-peonies.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a still life depicting a vase of flowers, evokes no sense of anger whatsoever. The subject matter itself—a bouquet of blossoms—is inherently peaceful and decorative, typically associated with beauty, tranquility, and positive sentiments. The colors used are predominantly soft and harmonious, featuring creamy whites, gentle yellows, and muted oranges and pinks against a backdrop of earthy browns and deep blues/greens. There are no harsh, jarring, or aggressive color combinations that might convey frustration or rage. The brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, is loose, fluid, and expressive, but it lacks any vigorous, violent, or agitated quality that could suggest an angry hand or an angry subject. Rather, the strokes feel gentle and observational, capturing the delicate forms of the petals. The overall composition is balanced and serene, devoid of any chaotic elements, sharp angles, or disruptive movements that could induce feelings of irritation or conflict. There are no figures present to display angry expressions or actions, nor is there any narrative context that could imply resentment or fury. The painting's essence is one of quiet contemplation and aesthetic appreciation, making the presence of anger completely incongruous with its visual language and emotional resonance."
west-front-of-blenheim-palace.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of anger whatsoever. The scene depicted is a serene and peaceful landscape, bathed in what appears to be soft, dappled sunlight filtering through lush green trees. The color palette consists predominantly of harmonious greens, warm yellows, and earthy browns, which contribute to an overall calming and natural atmosphere. There are no harsh lines, aggressive brushstrokes, or turbulent compositions that might suggest conflict, agitation, or rage.

weeping-willow-4-1919.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, ""Weeping Willow"" by Claude Monet, offers virtually no visual elements or thematic cues that would evoke a feeling of anger. The primary colors – an array of greens, yellows, blues, and some reds and oranges – are harmonious and representational of nature, rather than clashing or aggressive. While red can sometimes be associated with anger, its use here within the context of a tree trunk and autumnal foliage is entirely natural and does not carry any sense of menace or rage. The brushstrokes, characteristic of Impressionism, are loose and expressive, conveying the movement of light and leaves, but they lack any harshness, sharpness, or violent energy that might suggest agitation or fury. There is no depiction of conflict, struggle, or any agitated human or natural forms. The subject itself, a weeping willow, is generally associated with beauty, nature, or even melancholy, but not with hostility or aggression. The overall mood is one of natural vibrancy and a deep engagement with light and color, completely devoid of any tension, frustration, or ire. The score of 0.5 acknowledges the absolute theoretical possibility that a viewer might project an intensely personal and idiosyncratic feeling onto any artwork, but objectively, the painting presents nothing to trigger or embody anger."
valley-of-the-creuse-afternoon-sunlight.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting elicits no sense of anger whatsoever. There are no visual elements or atmospheric cues that contribute to an impression of hostility, fury, frustration, or aggression. The color palette, while featuring deep and dark tones of blues, purples, and browns, conveys solemnity and depth rather than any agitated or volatile emotion. These colors are predominantly cool and earthy, lacking the fiery reds, sharp oranges, or stark, clashing contrasts often associated with anger.

The brushwork appears expressive but not chaotic or violent; instead, it renders the forms of the hills and water with a sense of texture and movement that feels natural and fluid, not turbulent or destructive. The water, while dynamic with its reflections and apparent currents, flows steadily and does not crash or rage. Similarly, the imposing dark mass of the cliff on the left, though visually dominant and heavy, conveys a sense of ancient, unyielding presence rather than a threatening or aggressive one.

Furthermore, there is an absence of any depicted conflict, struggle, or tense situations within the landscape. The sky is relatively calm with soft, diffused light, lacking stormy clouds or dramatic, unsettling weather patterns. The overall impression is one of quiet grandeur, deep contemplation, or the serene power of nature, entirely devoid of any emotional resonance that could be interpreted as anger."
winter.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes absolutely no sense of anger. The scene depicts a serene and quiet winter landscape, characterized by soft, muted colors and a sense of stillness. The snow-covered ground in the foreground, the line of trees with their subtle reddish and yellowish tones, and the calm body of water beneath a hazy, overcast sky all contribute to an atmosphere of tranquility and perhaps a touch of melancholy or introspection, but certainly not anger. There are no harsh lines, turbulent brushstrokes, or aggressive color juxtapositions that might suggest agitation or rage. The composition is balanced and peaceful, and the overall mood is one of quiet contemplation rather than emotional intensity or conflict. There are no elements within the painting—visual cues, subject matter, or implied narrative—that could be interpreted as conveying anger in any form."

The scene depicts a serene winter landscape where people are engaged in ordinary activities like ice skating on a frozen waterway. The figures appear calm and engaged in leisure or routine tasks, with no signs of conflict, aggression, or distress. The color palette is muted, consisting of cool blues, grays, and earthy browns, which contributes to a tranquil, somewhat melancholic, but certainly not agitated, atmosphere. There are no harsh lines, violent gestures, or dramatic contrasts that would suggest any underlying tension or fury. The overall impression is one of quiet daily life or leisure, devoid of any emotional turmoil or hostility."
woman-in-kimono-holding-a-japanese-fan-1.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no discernible elements within this painting that evoke or portray anger. The central figure, a woman in a kimono-like garment, has a downcast gaze and a contemplative or perhaps melancholic expression, but certainly not one of anger. Her body language is relaxed, with no signs of tension, aggression, or agitation often associated with this emotion, such as clenched fists, furrowed brows, or a rigid posture. The overall atmosphere of the painting is quiet and still, almost introspective, lacking any dynamic or confrontational energy that might suggest anger. The subdued lighting and harmonious color palette further contribute to a sense of calm rather than conflict or fury.

In essence, every visual cue in the painting points away from any presence of anger."
woman-putting-on-her-stockings-1895.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no discernible elements within this painting that convey anger. The central figure, a woman, is depicted in a moment of quiet, focused activity, seemingly adjusting her stocking or putting on a shoe. Her posture is one of absorption in her task, leaning forward with her head slightly bowed. Her facial expression, though not fully visible due to her gaze being directed downwards, shows no signs of tension, furrowed brows, or tightened lips that would indicate frustration, irritation, or rage. Her hands are engaged in a delicate, careful motion, rather than clenched or forceful gestures associated with anger. The overall composition and color palette, featuring soft blues, pinks, and earthy tones, create a serene and domestic atmosphere, entirely devoid of any visual discord or agitation. The setting appears to be an ordinary interior, with no dramatic lighting or chaotic elements that might suggest an underlying emotional turmoil. The subject's calm demeanor and the peaceful rendering of the scene preclude any interpretation of anger."

The scene depicts a serene and tranquil winter landscape, characterized by vast expanses of soft white snow, a gently winding stream with calm, deep blue-green water, and a few isolated trees.

The scene depicts a serene and idyllic garden, bathed in natural light, with lush foliage and blooming roses. The color palette consists of warm greens, yellows, earthy browns, soft pinks, and a tranquil blue sky, all of which contribute to a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere.

The overall impression is one of tranquility, beauty, and quiet enjoyment of nature, completely devoid of any emotional tension or discord."
young-girl-in-the-fields.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of anger. The primary elements of the artwork – the solitary figure, the expansive field, the muted color palette, and the loose, impressionistic brushstrokes – combine to create a mood that is contemplative, serene, or perhaps melancholic, but entirely devoid of any aggressive or agitated emotional content. The figure's posture is still and non-confrontational; there is no discernible facial expression that could hint at frustration or fury. The landscape itself, with its warm yellows and browns, suggests a natural, harvested environment, not a scene of conflict or distress. There are no harsh lines, jarring contrasts, or intense, saturated colors (like sharp reds or deep, ominous blacks) that might typically convey anger or tension. The overall impression is one of quiet solitude and observation, standing in direct opposition to any feeling of anger. A score of 0.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an observer projecting an extremely subtle, almost imperceptible, or highly personal interpretation of unease that could *very distantly* relate to a root cause of anger, but this is not visually supported by the painting's elements. For all practical purposes, anger is absent from this work."
zimsko-jutro-1911.jpg,impressionism,5.5,"The painting evokes very little, if any, sense of anger. The overall palette is muted and cool, dominated by shades of blue, grey, and ochre, which tend to create a serene or melancholic atmosphere rather than one of aggression or fury. There are no sharp, clashing colors or stark contrasts that might visually represent an emotional outburst. While the impasto is thick and the brushstrokes are visible, creating a textured surface, they do not appear violent or chaotic. Instead, the texture seems to contribute to the solidity and quiet dignity of the depicted structures and landscape, possibly suggesting the harshness of a winter environment, but not an emotional state of anger. The composition is calm and stable, featuring block-like forms of buildings that sit firmly within the frame. There are no dynamic or agitated lines that would convey inner turmoil or an outward expression of anger. The subject matter itself—a winter or misty landscape with buildings—is inherently peaceful and devoid of any elements that would typically provoke or depict anger. The absence of figures or discernible action further removes any potential for depicting human emotion, especially one as intense as anger. The feeling conveyed is one of quiet contemplation, perhaps a touch of bleakness or solitude, but definitively not anger."
