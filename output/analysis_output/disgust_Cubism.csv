baj-chez-picasso-4-1969.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this artwork that evoke a sense of disgust. The image presents a stylized, abstract figure with geometric shapes and bright, clean colors (blue, yellow, and a muted reddish-orange). The blue 'head' with its single large yellow eye is presented in a whimsical, almost playful manner. The texture of the blue figure, resembling bubbles or circles, and the patterned red base are decorative and do not suggest anything repulsive or unhygienic. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or any other imagery typically associated with inducing disgust. The composition is clean, the lines are sharp, and the overall aesthetic is one of abstract simplicity rather than a visceral or unpleasant experience. Therefore, the artwork completely lacks visual cues that would trigger a feeling of disgust."
at-wattle-1972-5.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, depicting a woman and a cow within what appears to be a rural or stable setting, presents no elements typically associated with the emotion of disgust. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, illness, gore, or anything unsanitary or repulsive. The subjects are rendered in a somewhat stylized, almost expressionistic manner, with thick impasto paint. While the textured paint might evoke a tactile sensation, it does not suggest anything inherently disgusting like slime, putrefaction, or grime. The colors used are earthy and natural, lacking any hues that would indicate sickness or corruption. The scene's overall mood is contemplative or pastoral, not one that would trigger revulsion or nausea. The very low score acknowledges the extreme rarity of a perfectly zero emotional response, allowing for the most minimal, almost imperceptible, potential for any negative association one might project, but fundamentally, the visual content does not stimulate disgust."
arlequin-dansant-1924.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, an abstract and geometric composition, does not evoke any sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual elements that are unhygienic, repulsive, morally offensive, or represent decay, illness, or extreme unpleasantness. This artwork contains none of these qualities. The forms are clean, sharp, and structured, even when they are organic or fragmented. The color palette, while varied, consists of rich and earthy tones (reds, greens, purples, browns, yellows) that are visually harmonious rather than jarring or sickening. There is no depiction of gore, filth, decay, grotesque figures, or any subject matter that would typically induce a feeling of revulsion or aversion. The overall aesthetic is one of order, design, and artistic exploration of form and color, which is far removed from anything that would cause disgust. The minimal score of 0.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly abstract interpretation, but fundamentally, the visual content itself presents no cause for this emotion."
ang-magbabayo-pounding-rice-1979.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts two figures engaged in what appears to be the traditional act of pounding grain in a mortar and pestle, a common and fundamental activity in many cultures. The scene is one of labor and perhaps communal effort, depicted with a vibrant and warm color palette dominated by yellows, oranges, and greens. The figures themselves are rendered in a dynamic, somewhat abstract style, but their forms are not distorted or grotesque. There are no signs of decay, filth, disease, violence, or any visually offensive or repulsive substances. The overall impression is one of energy, tradition, and a connection to the earth or sustenance, all of which are antithetical to the emotion of disgust. The painting's aesthetic is clean and bright, further preventing any sensation of revulsion."
abstract-composition-figures-in-a-landscape-1930.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The emotion of disgust is largely absent in this artwork. The composition is abstract, featuring a blend of organic and geometric forms rendered primarily in pastel and charcoal. There are no elements within the visual language that typically trigger a feeling of revulsion. The color palette, consisting of muted greens, yellows, grays, blacks, and a touch of blue, is neither jarring nor suggestive of decay or unhygienic conditions. The forms, while somewhat amorphous and blob-like in places (particularly the gray and black masses on the right and the green form on the left), do not directly resemble anything inherently repulsive such as bodily fluids, gore, waste, or grotesque creatures. There is a certain roughness to the crayon texture, and the lines are gestural, but this does not translate into a sensation of unpleasantness or filth. The geometric elements, such as the hexagonal shape, further contribute to a more intellectual and less visceral interpretation of the piece. While abstract art can sometimes evoke discomfort or unease, this particular piece does not employ visual strategies that align with the specific sensation of disgust, which is typically a response to something perceived as offensive, sickening, or unclean. The mild score of 5.5 is given simply because, in rare cases, extremely abstract or unconventional forms can, for a very small minority of viewers, elicit a slight feeling of unease that *could* border on mild distaste, but it is not a direct or intended effect of this artwork. There is nothing overtly unsettling, repulsive, or nauseating presented."
bouteille-et-livre-rose-1926.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this abstract composition that elicits or even remotely suggests a feeling of disgust. The color palette, composed of soft pastels (pinks, blues, purples, greens, browns, and whites), is gentle and harmonious, devoid of any sickly or unappetizing hues often associated with unpleasantness. The shapes are abstract and geometric, or mildly biomorphic, but they are clean, defined, and arranged in a balanced manner. There are no distorted, decaying, grotesque, or visceral forms that might trigger a sensation of revulsion. The painting lacks any discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as unclean, offensive, violent, or physically repulsive. Instead, the overall impression is one of calmness, order, and intellectual contemplation, which stands in direct opposition to any feeling of disgust."
biblical-scene.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits or even hints at the emotion of disgust. The scene depicts two stylized figures, one attending to another who is lying down, perhaps adjusting a blanket or sheet. This interaction appears to be a mundane, domestic, or potentially caring act. There are no elements suggesting contamination, decay, squalor, bodily fluids, physical repulsion, or any form of moral offense. The colors are vibrant and clean, not murky or sickly. The forms are abstract and simplified, preventing any realistic depiction of features that might trigger revulsion. The overall composition and subject matter are neutral to positive, completely devoid of any visual cues associated with disgust."
a-red-pedestal-1942.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, an abstract still life, presents no elements traditionally associated with eliciting disgust. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, contamination, grotesque figures, or anything that would typically trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or nausea. The colors, while strong and vibrant (predominantly reds and oranges), are not inherently nauseating or suggestive of unpleasantries. The forms are fragmented and abstract, characteristic of Cubism, which can be disorienting or challenging to interpret, but this visual distortion does not convey any sense of physical repulsion or contamination. The objects, such as the mandolin/lute and the shoe-like form, are recognizable still-life elements, albeit stylized. While the overall aesthetic might be perceived as intense or visually jarring by some, it does not cross into the realm of the repulsive or unsanitary. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is virtually absent, meriting a score extremely close to zero, reflecting only the absolute slightest, almost imperceptible, potential for aesthetic unease that could, in the most tenuous and subjective interpretation, lean towards a minimal form of displeasure, but certainly not genuine disgust."
bibemus-quarry-1898-1.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting, a landscape by Paul CÃ©zanne, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The artwork depicts a natural scene with trees, rocks, and some architectural elements, rendered in a Post-Impressionist style characterized by distinct brushstrokes and a focus on form and color. There are no elements within the painting's subject matter or execution that would typically trigger a feeling of revulsion or repulsion. The colors are earthy and vibrant (greens, oranges, browns, a light sky), and the forms, while abstracted, are solid and structural, not grotesque or unsettling. There is no depiction of decay, filth, gore, disease, unpleasant bodily functions, disturbing creatures, or any morally repugnant acts. The scene is devoid of any visual or implied sensory information that could lead to a feeling of nausea, strong aversion, or moral outrage, all of which are common triggers for disgust. The overall impression is one of a robust and structured natural environment, completely antithetical to feelings of disgust."
aviator.jpg,Cubism,25.5,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this painting, primarily due to a few unsettling visual elements that are heavily mitigated by the artwork's abstract and stylized nature. The strongest potential source of disgust is the large, white fish draped across the man's torso. While the idea of a raw, dead fish on a person could inherently suggest sliminess, decay, or an unpleasant smell, the fish here is depicted in a pristine white, almost flat manner, with no texture or color to indicate actual decomposition, moisture, or offensive odor. Its stylized, jagged bottom edge makes it appear more like a symbolic object or a graphic element rather than a decaying biological entity.

Another element that could potentially trigger discomfort, though not necessarily strong disgust, is the object (resembling a fork or rake) impaled in the man's head. However, this is presented in a surreal and clean fashion, entirely devoid of blood, gore, or any explicit depiction of a festering wound or bodily fluid. It's more shocking or unsettling as a surrealistic act than as a viscerally disgusting injury.

The overall Cubo-Futurist style, with its geometric fragmentation and non-naturalistic colors (such as the man's green-yellow face), intellectualizes the subject matter, creating a significant distance between the viewer and any potential for raw, visceral revulsion. The painting lacks any visual cues commonly associated with strong disgust, such as putrefaction, filth, bodily waste, disease, or extreme disfigurement presented realistically. Therefore, while there's a faint, almost intellectual echo of potential unpleasantness due to the unusual subject matter, the execution effectively bypasses a genuine feeling of revulsion or nausea."
breads-1920.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of disgust independently, I find no discernible elements within this painting that would evoke such a feeling. Disgust typically arises from visual cues suggesting contamination, decay, putrefaction, unhygienic conditions, or spoiled substances. This still life, conversely, presents a collection of domestic itemsâa scale, what appears to be various forms of bread or baked goods, and a cupâall of which are inherently benign. The baked goods, while depicted with a certain rustic texture and possibly appearing dense or well-used, show no signs of mold, spoilage, or decomposition. There are no unpleasant residues, no unsettling colors suggestive of decay, nor any distorted forms that might trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The overall palette is muted and earthy, contributing to a sense of solemnity or humble reality, but not to any feeling of sickness or aversion. The objects are presented in a straightforward manner, devoid of any visual narrative or textural quality that would lead to a feeling of disgust."
animal-destinies-the-trees-show-their-rings-the-animals-their-veins.jpg,Cubism,8.0,"The painting primarily evokes feelings of chaos, anxiety, tragedy, and a sense of overwhelming destruction rather than physical disgust. There are no explicit visual elements such as gore, bodily fluids, decay, or filth that typically trigger a strong visceral reaction of disgust. The fragmented forms and sharp, intersecting lines, while conveying violence and rupture, are abstract and symbolic, preventing a direct nauseating response. However, a very subtle element of disgust may arise from a sense"
chorinho-1942.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts four figures, likely musicians, in a stylized, somewhat cubist or abstract manner, engaging in what appears to be a musical performance or expression. The figures are not grotesque, deformed, or diseased. There are no elements of decay, filth, bodily fluids, or any other traditionally repulsive imagery present. The color palette, dominated by cool blues, greens, grays, and whites, does not include colors commonly associated with sickness or decay. The expressions and postures of the figures, while stylized and conveying emotion or movement, do not suggest revulsion or an unpleasant sensation that would trigger disgust in the viewer. The overall atmosphere, while perhaps melancholic or intense, is not one of repulsion or nausea."
bull-plate-x-1946.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The artwork, a minimalist line drawing of an abstracted bull, presents no visual elements commonly associated with disgust. There is no depiction of gore, decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything grotesque or inherently repulsive. The lines are clean, the composition is simplified, and the black and white palette offers no disturbing color cues. While the abstraction might lead to a sense of unease or unfamiliarity for some viewers due to its departure from realism, this is distinct from genuine disgust. The animal form, even in its highly stylized state, does not convey sickness, deformity in a visceral sense, or any other quality that would trigger a strong aversion response. Any minute trace of disgust would likely stem from an extremely idiosyncratic reaction to the concept of extreme deconstruction of a natural form, rather than any intentional or widely perceived repulsive quality within the artwork itself."
chateau-noir-1.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a landscape with a building nestled among trees, does not evoke any sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is typically provoked by imagery that is offensive, repulsive, or sickening, often associated with decay, filth, or moral abomination. This artwork contains none of these elements. The color palette, dominated by warm yellows and oranges for the building contrasting with various shades of green and blue for the foliage and sky, is aesthetically pleasing and harmonious rather than jarring or repulsive. The subject matterâa natural setting with human architectureâis inherently neutral and lacks any visual cues that could be interpreted as unhygienic, decaying, grotesque, or morally corrupt. The visible brushstrokes, characteristic of CÃ©zanne's style, contribute to the texture and form of the scene but do not depict anything that could be considered vile or repugnant. There is an absence of any unsettling details, unpleasant textures, or disturbing narratives that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust."
bull-study-1946.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"The image presents a series of studies exploring the abstraction of a bull's form, evolving from more representational to highly simplified and geometric outlines. There are no visual elements within these drawings that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is an emotion generally triggered by something perceived as contaminated, offensive, decaying, grotesque, or morally repulsive. The artwork contains none of these characteristics. The lines are clean, the shapes are artistic interpretations, and the subject matter (a bull) is presented as a subject of artistic exploration, not as something inherently revulsive. There is no depiction of gore, decay, unhygienic conditions, or anything aesthetically jarring in a way that would cause repulsion. The intellectual and artistic nature of the work precludes the sensation of disgust, as the focus is on form, line, and the process of simplification."
city-movement-1940.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The artwork presents a semi-abstract urban landscape, characterized by fragmented forms, angular lines, and a palette of blues, reds, grays, and yellows. The subject matter appears to involve architectural elements and figures engaged in what looks like construction or labor. There are no visual cues typically associated with the emotion of disgust, such as filth, decay, bodily fluids, grotesque or repulsive textures, unsanitary conditions, or imagery suggesting contamination or putrefaction. The style is interpretive and dynamic, but does not present anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. Therefore, the painting elicits no feelings of disgust."
composition-iv-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This abstract painting presents a vibrant and complex interplay of geometric and organic shapes, rendered in a diverse palette of colors. There is absolutely nothing within the composition that triggers or evokes a feeling of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual stimuli associated with decay, disease, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, or things perceived as repulsive or contaminated. This artwork, however, is purely abstract; it contains no discernible figures, objects, or scenes that could be interpreted in such a way. The colors, while varied, are not jarring or nauseating. The textures appear to be painterly and rich, but not offensive or unpleasant to behold. The forms are fragmented and dynamic, but they do not suggest anything malformed, decaying, or otherwise repulsive. Therefore, there is no basis for an emotional response of disgust to this artwork."
composition-cubiste-au-portrait-poisson-et-clair-de-lune-1926.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject matter, a Cubist-inspired still life featuring a stylized fish and a pitcher-like form, is presented in a clean, abstract, and aesthetically neutral manner. The colors usedâblues, whites, blacks, muted greens, and brownsâare harmonious and do not suggest anything repulsive, spoiled, or grotesque. There are no textures or depictions that would evoke a visceral negative reaction often associated with disgust, such as decay, filth, or biological repulsion. The geometric abstraction further removes any potential for realistic, unpleasant details. It is a visually organized and non-threatening composition."
composition-ii-still-life-1916.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric forms and colors, elicits virtually no sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by stimuli that suggest decay, contamination, disease, or elements that are viscerally repulsive or morally offensive. This artwork presents an arrangement of shapes and hues, predominantly muted greens, reds, and browns, which are applied with a textured brushwork. There are no depictions of organic matter in a state of decay, no bodily fluids, no symbols of illness or squalor, nor any imagery that could be interpreted as grotesque or inherently repulsive. The geometric abstraction, while potentially challenging or aesthetically unappealing to some tastes, does not contain visual cues that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or nausea. The forms, whether interpreted as abstract shapes or mechanical components, are clean in their lines and execution, lacking any characteristics that suggest dirtiness, impurity, or offense. The extremely low score reflects the profound absence of any elements within the artwork that would typically prompt such an emotional response."
composition-au-visage-et-au-coquillage-1939.jpg,Cubism,15.0,"The painting presents highly stylized and fragmented figures, reminiscent of human faces, which possess an unsettling and somewhat grotesque quality. The most prominent element contributing to any sense of disgust is the figure on the right, with its distorted, staring eye and particularly its open mouth revealing jagged, uneven teeth. This portrayal of teeth can evoke a subtle feeling of aversion, perhaps suggesting something predatory, decayed, or simply unnaturally deformed, which can trigger a mild, visceral reaction in some viewers. The overall angularity and the fragmented nature of the forms contribute to a sense of unease or 'wrongness' in the representation of the human form. However, the level of disgust is very low because there is no explicit depiction of gore, bodily fluids, decay, filth, or any subject matter typically associated with strong feelings of revulsion. The distortion is primarily artistic and serves to create a psychological atmosphere of tension or disquiet rather than a visceral reaction of sickness or abhorrence. Any disgust evoked is therefore faint and secondary, stemming from the unsettling grotesqueness rather than outright repulsiveness."
bust-of-woman-1939.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting, a Cubist portrait by Pablo Picasso, presents a highly fragmented and reassembled human face. While this severe distortion departs significantly from naturalistic representation and can be unsettling or visually challenging for some viewers, it does not primarily evoke the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically a visceral reaction to something perceived as repulsive, unclean, decaying, or morally offensive.

This artwork lacks any elements commonly associated with triggering disgust, such as:
1.  **Pathogens or decay:** There is no depiction of illness, wounds, bodily fluids, rotting matter, or unsanitary conditions. The colors are vibrant and clean, not suggestive of putrefaction or filth.
2.  **Grotesque or vile subject matter:** The subject is a portrait, and despite the artistic manipulation, it doesn't represent something inherently loathsome or morally reprehensible.
3.  **Sensory triggers:** There are no visual cues that would imply offensive smells, tastes, or textures that typically accompany disgust.

The distortion employed is an artistic and intellectual exploration of form and perspective, rather than an attempt to portray something physically repulsive or vile. While a very minor level of aversion might occur in some viewers unaccustomed to or strongly resistant to such abstract reconfigurations of the human form, this feeling would be more akin to unease, surprise, or aesthetic disapproval rather than genuine disgust, which implies a strong sense of revulsion or contamination. Therefore, the score for disgust is very low, reflecting only a marginal, atypical possibility of such a reaction."
constructive-town-1925.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits the emotion of disgust. The artwork features a stylized, somewhat cubist landscape with a calm color palette of muted browns, greens, and greys, punctuated by some more vibrant reds and blues in the still life on the right. The figures, including the idealized female form and the simplified white dog, are rendered cleanly and abstractly, devoid of any grotesque, disturbing, or unsanitary qualities. There are no depictions of decay, filth, violence, bodily fluids, or any subject matter typically associated with feelings of revulsion. The overall aesthetic is one of quiet contemplation and geometric harmony, rather than anything jarring or unpleasant to the senses. As such, the painting offers no visual cues or thematic elements that would trigger a sensation of disgust in a viewer."
construction-africa-cezanne-cubism-and-japan.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The artwork presents a vibrant and complex mixed-media composition that explores themes of art history, cultural influences, and abstract design. It incorporates a variety of materials and visual elements, including graphic text (CÃ©zanne, Africa, Cubism, Japan), geometric shapes, recognizable objects (a die, a fan, a yin-yang symbol, what appears to be a pipe, nails), and colorful patterns. The color palette is bright and diverse, dominated by primary and secondary colors. There are no elements within the image that could reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust. There is no depiction of gore, decay, bodily fluids, filth, contamination, disease, or anything generally considered repulsive or offensive. The objects and forms are clean, stylized, and arranged in an artistic manner. The overall impression is one of intellectual curiosity, artistic exploration, and cultural appreciation, which stands in direct opposition to any sensation of revulsion or unpleasantness."
crimea-alupka-1916-1.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting, a vibrant landscape depicting houses nestled on a hillside overlooking a blue sea with distinctive tall trees, contains absolutely no visual elements or thematic content that could reasonably evoke a sensation of disgust. The color palette, dominated by blues, greens, yellows, and whites, is fresh and energetic, entirely lacking the sickly, putrid, or unsettling hues often associated with aversive reactions. The subject matterâa scenic view of a coastal townâis inherently picturesque and benign, presenting nothing grotesque, decaying, filthy, or offensive. There are no unsettling textures, no disturbing forms or shapes, and no narrative suggestions of blight, disease, or any universally repulsive phenomena. The stylistic choices, including visible brushwork and somewhat simplified forms, contribute to an overall pleasant and expressive aesthetic rather than highlighting any detail that might trigger revulsion. In every aspect, the artwork remains aesthetically clean and visually appealing, leaving no basis for the emotion of disgust to be perceived."
deer-in-the-forest-1913.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject matter, which includes peacefully resting roe deer, a bird in flight, and a vibrant forest, is inherently beautiful and natural, not something typically associated with revulsion. There are no elements of gore, decay, filth, sickness, or anything visually repulsive. The colors, while strong and expressionistic (particularly the prominent reds and blues), are used harmoniously to create an energetic and spiritual atmosphere rather than suggesting violence or unpleasant bodily states. The abstract and fragmented forms are stylistic choices that convey movement and the interconnectedness of nature, not dismemberment or distortion designed to provoke nausea. The overall feeling conveyed by the artwork is one of vitalism, harmony, and a deep appreciation for the living world, which stands in direct opposition to any sensation of disgust."
dessert-1913.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, a Cubist still life, presents a fragmented and geometric interpretation of common household objects such as a bowl of fruit, a pitcher, and a vase. There is absolutely nothing within the subject matter that would typically elicit disgust. The items depicted are everyday, innocuous objects, and they are not rendered in a way that suggests decay, spoilage, uncleanliness, or any other quality that might be repulsive. The Cubist style, while abstract and disorienting to some, is an artistic exploration of form and perspective; it does not introduce elements that are inherently offensive or nauseating. The color palette, composed of earthy tones, greens, greys, and yellows, is harmonious and lacks any sickly or jarring combinations that could provoke a visceral negative reaction. There are no grotesque figures, disturbing scenes, or unsanitary conditions implied. The entire aesthetic purpose of the painting seems to be an intellectual and visual exercise rather than an attempt to evoke any strong emotional response of revulsion. The score is not an absolute 0 only because art interpretation is subjective and a minuscule, almost negligible, degree of discomfort could theoretically arise in some viewers from the disorientation of the fragmented forms if they find it overwhelmingly chaotic, but this is far from true disgust."
costume-design-3.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The artwork, with its highly stylized and geometric depiction of a human figure, elicits virtually no sense of disgust. There are no elements within the image that typically trigger this emotion: no representations of bodily fluids, waste, decay, or contamination. The figure, while abstracted and angular, is not portrayed as grotesque, diseased, or deformed in a way that would provoke revulsion; rather, its stylization is an artistic choice, leaning towards cubist or constructivist aesthetics. The colors, though bold (deep green, red, black, white), are not inherently nauseating or disturbing. There is no narrative context or subject matter that suggests moral depravity or anything abhorrent. The overall impression is one of dynamic artistic expression, likely a costume design or character study for performance, which aims for visual impact and character portrayal rather than eliciting a visceral reaction of repulsion. Any minuscule score assigned would be merely to acknowledge the most remote theoretical possibility that a viewer with an extreme aversion to abstract or non-naturalistic human forms might experience a fleeting, almost imperceptible sense of discomfort, but this falls far short of true disgust."
diavolii-stage-design.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting, with its sharp geometric forms and bold, primary colors, leans heavily into abstraction and constructivist aesthetics. The figures, while vaguely human-like, are so stylized and reduced to basic shapes that they lose any potential for conveying visceral, organic qualities that might evoke disgust. There are no elements of decay, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or grotesque features. The clean lines, angular compositions, and vibrant color palette present a visual experience that is aesthetically controlled and precise, rather than messy, repulsive, or offensive. While some viewers might find the abstract nature jarring or even unsettling in a mild way due to its departure from realism, this is distinct from the feeling of disgust, which typically stems from revulsion towards something perceived as foul, diseased, or morally contemptible. The visual information present simply does not provide the necessary cues to trigger a feeling of disgust. The ""2"" allows for the *barest* hypothetical flicker of discomfort if one were to find the starkness or unusual portrayal of figures mildly off-putting in a way that *could* lean towards aversion, but it's far from true disgust."
dances-at-the-spring-1912.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting provides no visual cues whatsoever that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork features highly abstract, geometric figures rendered in a palette of earthy tones including various shades of brown, orange, and cream. There is no depiction of decay, filth, gore, disease, or any subject matter that is inherently repulsive or offensive. The forms, while fragmented and reassembled in a Cubist manner, do not suggest physical deformation in a grotesque sense, nor do they imply any actions or states that would be considered morally or physically repugnant. The aesthetic is one of formal exploration rather than visceral emotional provocation. There are no disturbing textures, unappetizing colors, or narratives that could lead to a feeling of revulsion or aversion. Consequently, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent when viewing this artwork."
crane-and-pitcher-1945.jpg,Cubism,22.5,"The primary source of potential disgust in this painting stems from the subject matter of the skull, which inherently symbolizes death, decay, and mortality. These themes are fundamental triggers for human disgust, as they are often associated with disease, contamination, and the inevitable end of life. The skull's empty eye sockets and bared, geometrically rendered teeth contribute to a sense of the macabre and unsettling, subtly evoking an aversion to the processes of decomposition and physical deterioration. The choice of muted, somewhat sickly purples and browns for parts of the skull can also contribute to a subconscious feeling of unease or slight revulsion.

However, the degree of disgust evoked is significantly tempered by several factors. Picasso's Cubist style abstracts and fragments the forms, distancing the viewer from a realistic or graphic depiction of decay. There is no visible gore, explicit signs of putrefaction, or foul textures that would trigger a strong, visceral gag reflex. The composition is highly stylized and intellectual, inviting contemplation rather than an immediate, instinctual repulsion. The vibrant yellow background and the geometric precision throughout the painting create a visual interest and aesthetic distance that mitigate an overwhelming sense of revulsion. The disgust present is thus more symbolic and intellectual, a quiet disquiet related to the idea of decay, rather than a powerful, gut-level revulsion."
composition-with-the-mona-lisa-1914.jpg,Cubism,72.0,"The painting evokes a significant degree of disgust, primarily stemming from its deliberate act of iconoclasm and the jarring juxtaposition of elements. The most prominent source of this emotion is the image of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, a universally revered masterpiece of classical art, prominently defaced with a bold red 'X' across her face. For a viewer who holds traditional art, beauty, and cultural heritage in high esteem, this act can be perceived as deeply disrespectful, vulgar, and even an artistic desecration. The 'X' symbolically cancels or rejects the very essence of what the Mona Lisa represents, which can be repulsive to someone who cherishes such values.

Furthermore, the placement of the text ""ÐÐÐ ÐÐÐÐÐ¢Ð¡Ð¯ ÐÐÐÐ Ð¢ÐÐ Ð"" (Apartment for Rent) directly over the defaced Mona Lisa adds another layer of distaste. This mundane, commercial, and rather crude advertisement juxtaposed with a defaced art icon creates a sense of profound banality and commercialization being imposed upon something that is (or was) considered sacred and sublime. This mixing of high art with low commercialism can be perceived as an act of artistic violence or vulgarity, leading to a strong feeling of aesthetic and intellectual revulsion. The overall fragmented and chaotic composition, while characteristic of the avant-garde, can also contribute to a sense of discomfort or aesthetic unease, though the defaced Mona Lisa remains the primary trigger for disgust due to its direct assault on established artistic and cultural norms."
dropsgezicht-1911.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes disgust. The vibrant colors, while bold and perhaps unconventional for a realistic landscape, do not suggest anything unpleasant or repulsive. The subject matter â a village with houses, trees, and a church spire under a dynamic sky â is neutral and even picturesque. There are no elements of decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or anything that would trigger a visceral sensation of revulsion. The artistic style, whether Expressionist or Fauvist, utilizes color and simplified shapes in a way that contributes to a sense of energy and visual interest, rather than anything that might be deemed disgusting. The overall impression is one of a lively, perhaps even idealized, rural scene."
egg-beater-no-4-1928.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this abstract painting that evokes any sense of disgust. The artwork features bold, clean lines, vibrant colors (greens, yellows, reds, blues, oranges, whites, and blacks), and a dynamic interplay of geometric and biomorphic shapes. There are no recognizable figures or objects that could be associated with decay, uncleanliness, bodily fluids, or any other source of physical revulsion. Nor does the abstract composition suggest any narrative or symbolic meaning that would imply moral corruption, injustice, or anything offensive. The aesthetic is one of energy, design, and visual harmony, rather than anything chaotic, disturbing, or repulsive. The painting is a non-representational work that focuses on form, color, and composition, offering no content that would trigger a visceral negative reaction like disgust."
ecstasy-1960-2.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting employs a highly fragmented and abstract style, using overlapping forms and a palette of blues, reds, and grays to depict figures, possibly engaged in a musical or contemplative scene. While the human forms are significantly distorted and broken into geometric planes, this distortion is a hallmark of the artistic style, reminiscent of Cubism or Orphism, rather than an attempt to portray something grotesque or repulsive. The partial nudity is integrated into the abstract composition and does not appear vulgar or offensive in a manner that would provoke disgust. The colors, predominantly cool blues with warm accents, create an atmospheric or dreamlike quality rather than evoking feelings of revulsion. There are no elements of decay, gore, filth, moral depravity, or extreme ugliness that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. The overall impression is one of artistic interpretation and contemplation, not visceral repulsion. The minimal score reflects the absence of any content or stylistic choices that would intentionally or unintentionally elicit disgust."
enangalismos.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting presents no visual cues that would elicit a feeling of disgust. The color palette, while moody and intense with deep reds, purples, blues, and dark greens, does not feature sickly or putrid tones commonly associated with decay, illness, or filth. The abstracted forms, including the large, stylized hands and the fragmented facial elements, are not grotesque, disfigured in a repulsive manner, or suggestive of contamination, injury, or bodily fluids. There are no elements of gore, waste, rot, or unsanitary conditions depicted. The aesthetic is dramatic and expressive, rather than offensive or nauseating, making the emotion of disgust virtually absent."
falk-sleeping-gypsy.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"This painting offers very little, if any, visual cues that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The subject matter depicts a person seemingly at rest or in repose, an inherently neutral or even peaceful scene. There are no elements of decay, filth, bodily fluids, injury, or anything putrid or unhygienic. The color palette, while vibrant and fragmented due to the artistic style, does not contain hues typically associated with sickness, decay, or rot. The shapes and forms are abstracted but do not coalesce into anything grotesque or visually repulsive. The fragmented nature of the face and body, while departing from realistic representation, does not distort the figure in a way that suggests disfigurement or horror. Overall, the artwork lacks any thematic content, visual texture, or implied narrative that would trigger an innate human response of revulsion or aversion. The very low score reflects the absence of any discernible element that could be interpreted as disgusting."
explosion-lyrique-no-c-1918.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting presents a vibrant and dynamic composition with bold brushstrokes and a palette dominated by strong, clear colors such as blues, greens, reds, yellows, and oranges. The subject, a stylized figure in motion, is rendered in an abstract or semi-abstract manner. There are no elements within the paintingâsuch as decay, explicit violence, bodily fluids, grotesque distortion, or unsanitary conditionsâthat would typically trigger a sensation of revulsion or disgust. The bright and harmonious color scheme, along with the energetic lines, contributes to a feeling of vitality and movement rather than anything repugnant or unsettling. The simplified facial features do not convey any expression that could be interpreted as disturbing or repulsive. Consequently, there is nothing in the visual content or artistic style that would elicit an emotional response of disgust."
factory-in-nara-1918.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting presents a landscape featuring a bridge, buildings, and natural elements rendered in a Cubist or Expressionist style. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that evoke disgust. The subject matter itselfâan urban or industrial landscape intersecting with natureâis neutral and does not depict anything inherently repulsive, such as decay, filth, gore, disease, or unsanitary conditions. The colors, while bold (like the pink-red buildings), are not putrid or sickly; they are vibrant and contribute to the painting's artistic rather than repulsive aesthetic. The brushwork and simplified forms, while abstract, do not suggest messiness or contamination in a way that would trigger revulsion. There are no disturbing distortions of living beings or objects that would cause a sense of nausea or strong aversion. The overall impression is one of artistic interpretation of a scene, devoid of any visual cues typically associated with the emotion of disgust."
enclosures-and-broken-branches-1938.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting evokes an extremely negligible sense of disgust. Disgust typically arises from elements that are decaying, putrid, unhygienic, or visually repulsive in a visceral manner (e.g., bodily fluids, infestation, grotesque deformities). This artwork contains none of these traditional triggers. While there are elements that suggest death or barrenness, such as the pale, gnarled tree branches/roots in the upper central portion, their depiction is highly stylized and clean. They appear bleached and skeletal rather than actively rotting or infested, lacking any tactile or olfactory suggestion of decay that would provoke revulsion. The overall color palette is earthy and subdued, contributing to a sense of solemnity or contemplation of nature's cycles, but not to a feeling of revulsion. The abstract and patterned qualities of the different sections further distance the imagery from any realistic, potentially disgusting details. There is nothing present that suggests filth, contamination, or anything offensive to the senses in a way that would elicit a strong emotional response of disgust."
etude-pour-sculpture-1944.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting largely elicits very little to no sense of disgust. There are no elements within the artwork that traditionally trigger this emotion, such as depictions of gore, decay, bodily fluids, filth, or grotesque deformities. The forms, while abstract and biomorphic, are not rendered in a way that suggests internal organs, disease, or anything outwardly repulsive. The prominent yellow shape, reminiscent of a human hand, is stylized but does not convey injury, decomposition, or any unsanitary condition; rather, it appears almost sculptural. The central blue form, which might be interpreted as a head or face, is abstract and mask-like, devoid of features that would express revulsion or appear sickening. The color palette, though diverse, uses hues that are generally earthy and vibrant, without any combinations that might be perceived as sickening or unsettling in a visceral way. Any extremely faint flicker of unease a viewer might experience would likely stem from the general ambiguity or unfamiliarity of the abstract shapes rather than any explicit visual cue intended to provoke revulsion. However, this unease is far from genuine disgust."
farm-woman-1908-1.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes a feeling of disgust. The artwork features a stylized, somewhat abstract human figure rendered with bold lines and blocky forms, reminiscent of primitive sculpture or early modernist art. The color palette consists of earthy tones, blues, and grays, which are calm and not jarring or offensive. The visible brushstrokes and textural quality of the paint do not suggest anything unclean or repulsive. The figure itself, with its simplified, mask-like face and solid presence, does not convey any emotion or physical state that would be considered sickening, grotesque, or otherwise cause revulsion. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, or anything visually unpleasant that typically triggers disgust. The overall impression is one of solidity and introspection, devoid of any elements that would prompt an aversive reaction."
farm-at-montgeroult-1898.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The subject matter depicts a mundane street scene with buildings and trees, none of which are inherently repulsive, grotesque, or offensive. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything that would typically trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The colors, while varied and somewhat muted, are predominantly earthy tones, blues, and greens, which are not sickly or jarring in a way that would provoke an unpleasant physical response. The artistic style, characterized by visible brushstrokes and simplified forms, does not distort the elements into anything malformed or disgusting. The scene is devoid of any narrative or visual cues that could be associated with contamination, moral repugnance, or anything that would elicit a feeling of disgust."
fallen-figure-1939.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"This abstract painting presents a collection of geometric and smoothly rendered forms in a cool, muted color palette. There are no discernible elements within the artworkâsuch as grotesque figures, scenes of decay, depictions of unpleasant bodily functions, or repulsive texturesâthat would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. The colors used (various shades of grey, muted green, pale blue, browns, and a deep reddish-brown) are clean and harmonized, entirely lacking in the sickly or unwholesome hues often associated with things that evoke revulsion. The forms themselves are solid and structured, resembling industrial or architectural components rather than anything organic or putrefying. The overall composition is balanced and intellectual, drawing attention to shape, volume, and color relationships rather than eliciting a visceral emotional response. There is nothing visually offensive, threatening, or unsanitary about the artwork that could prompt a feeling of disgust."
femme-1954.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, an abstract work, primarily employs warm earthy tones, cool blues, and striking reds, outlined by dark lines. There are no visual cues within the compositionâsuch as grotesque forms, sickly colors, representations of decay, filth, or any subject matter typically associated with revulsionâthat would trigger a feeling of disgust. The forms are fluid and organic, yet highly stylized and non-representational in a way that might evoke a visceral negative reaction. The overall aesthetic is one of bold artistic expression through shape and color, rather than an attempt to provoke a sense of sickness or repulsion. A very minimal score is given, acknowledging the subjective nature of emotional response, but fundamentally, the artwork presents nothing that aligns with the common triggers for disgust."
farm-woman-1908.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork presents a stylized portrait, possibly influenced by primitivism or early modern art, with a focus on simplified, angular forms and earthy tones contrasted with a deep blue. The subject's features are abstract and sculptural rather than realistic, but they do not depict anything that is rotten, grotesque, unhygienic, or morally repugnant. The colors are rich and warm (oranges/browns) alongside cool (blues), and the brushstrokes are visible, contributing to the texture, but none of these elements suggest anything vile or offensive. The expression on the figure's face, if one can interpret it, leans more towards somberness or contemplation rather than any emotion that might be associated with disgust. Therefore, there is no visual cue or thematic element present that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or strong aversion."
forms-1918.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting, an abstract composition of geometric forms and colors, contains no elements that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. There are no depictions of decay, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, unpleasant textures, or themes that are inherently repulsive. The artwork's clean lines, defined shapes, and distinct color blocks present a visual experience that is orderly and devoid of any visual cues associated with revulsion or aversion. The palette, while varied, is not unsettling or sickly, and the abstract nature of the subject matter does not lend itself to evoking this particular emotion."
figure-in-un-interno-1947.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. The subject matter, which appears to be two abstract or simplified figures seated in an interior space, contains no elements that would trigger revulsion, nausea, or any form of aversion. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or anything unhygienic, grotesque, or morally repugnant. The colors used are a mix of muted pastels and charcoals, which are not inherently unpleasant or associated with disgust. The artistic style, while abstract and gestural, does not convey any disturbing or repulsive imagery. The lines are energetic but not harsh in a way that would be visually sickening. There are no disturbing narratives or implied content that would lead to this emotion. Consequently, there is nothing within this artwork that would elicit disgust from the viewer."
ferry-at-bigwin-island-1952.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with strong aversion, repulsion, or a visceral reaction to something perceived as offensive, unclean, decaying, or morally repugnant. The subject matter â a boat on the water â is neutral and does not inherently carry any disgusting connotations. The colors used (white, red, various blues and greens) are vibrant and clean, with no indication of rot, filth, or biological decay. The abstract and geometric style, while perhaps not universally appealing, does not present any distorted, grotesque, or inherently repulsive forms. There are no elements within the composition, such as bodily fluids, waste, gore, or scenes of extreme moral depravity, that would trigger a sensation of disgust. The overall impression is one of stylized maritime imagery, which may evoke other emotions like calm, movement, or contemplation, but certainly not revulsion. A score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any visual input, no matter how benign, might, in an extremely idiosyncratic individual, provoke an unexpected reaction, but functionally, for a general audience, there is no discernible element of disgust present."
futorismo-1927.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"This abstract painting does not evoke any sensation of disgust. The composition consists of clean, geometric, and curvilinear forms rendered in a palette of earthy browns, greys, muted yellows, and whites, accented with black lines. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest contamination, decay, unpleasant textures, or morally repugnant themes, which are typical triggers for disgust. The lines are sharp and defined, the colors are sober and harmoniously arranged, and the overall impression is one of ordered abstraction rather than anything chaotic or repulsive. The absence of any discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as vile, grotesque, or unhygienic ensures that the emotion of disgust remains completely unaffecting when viewing this piece. The score is marginally above zero to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any visual input, however neutral, could elicit an idiosyncratic or extremely rare response in some individuals, but for the vast majority, there is nothing in this artwork to provoke even the slightest feeling of disgust."
figure-with-fruit-dish.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting, ""Man with a Mandolin"" by Georges Braque, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The subject matter itself â a man with a musical instrument and some fruit â is benign and lacks any inherent qualities that would trigger revulsion. There are no depictions of gore, bodily fluids, waste, contamination, disease, or decay, which are common elicitors of disgust. The cubist style, characterized by fragmented forms, multiple perspectives, and earthy, muted tones (browns, ochres, greys, muted red), does not introduce elements that would provoke this emotion. While the fragmented presentation might be challenging or unsettling to some viewers due to its departure from realistic representation, this intellectual or aesthetic discomfort does not translate into a visceral feeling of disgust. The abstraction of the figure and objects, rather than showing grotesque or offensive details, renders them as geometric puzzles. There is nothing visually or thematically represented that suggests anything vile, repulsive, or offensive to the senses. The overall impression is one of formal artistic exploration rather than an attempt to portray anything unpleasant or sickening."
figure-with-balls-1938.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"My emotional response to this painting does not include disgust to any significant degree. The artwork, characterized by its abstract or semi-abstract forms and a muted color palette of blues, browns, and grays against an off-white and green background, presents no elements typically associated with eliciting disgust. There is an absence of traditional triggers such as gore, decay, filth, putrefaction, or grotesque distortions of the human or animal form that might evoke a visceral feeling of revulsion. The lines, while organic and somewhat angular, do not convey sliminess, disease, or any unhygienic state. The subject matter, which appears to be a stylized figure or an abstract composition, is presented in a manner that leans towards contemplation or formal exploration rather than depicting anything inherently offensive or repulsive to the senses. The overall aesthetic is somber and perhaps mysterious, but it does not delve into the realm of the sickening or the foul. Therefore, any sensation of disgust is virtually non-existent, registering only as an imperceptible flicker, if at all, due to the complete lack of stimuli typically associated with this emotion."
girl-untying-her-sandal-1973.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The artwork is a highly stylized, geometric abstraction of a seated female figure, rendered in a palette of whites, browns, and dark earth tones. The forms are clean, simplified, and angular, presenting a serene and contemplative, rather than grotesque or repulsive, image. There are no elements commonly associated with disgust, such as bodily fluids, decay, disease, gore, unsettling textures, or morally repugnant subject matter. The aesthetic is one of calm, elegant abstraction, far removed from anything that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or distaste."
figure-blanche.jpg,Cubism,74.5,"The primary source of disgust in this artwork stems from its strong and unsettling allusions to death, decay, and the visceral fragility of existence. The prominent skeletal structure on the right side, resembling a fractured spinal column or a collection of disarticulated bones, directly evokes themes of mortality and bodily decomposition. This imagery inherently triggers an 'animal-reminder' type of disgust, as it confronts the viewer with the morbid aspects of life and the physical endpoint of living beings.

Furthermore, the overall aesthetic of the print, characterized by its stark black-and-white contrast, heavy lines, and raw, almost gritty textures, contributes to a sense of unrefined and somewhat repulsive physicality. The central, heavily inked form, while abstract, suggests a creature that is either predatory, decaying, or both, with its large, dark mass and sharp, elongated features. The deliberate lack of smooth forms or inviting colors amplifies this feeling, leaning into a somber and unsettling mood. The impression is one of raw, exposed forms, perhaps even suggesting violence or the aftermath of a struggle, which can elicit a visceral sense of revulsion. The artwork deliberately avoids any softening or beautifying elements, presenting a stark and uncompromising view that challenges the viewer's comfort, thus engaging the emotion of disgust through its morbid subject matter and unpolished, visceral execution."
girl-portrait-1930.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The artwork presents no discernible elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. There is an absence of visual cues typically associated with this emotion, such as decay, putrefaction, bodily fluids, disease, gore, or unsanitary conditions. The subject matter, a woman seated with a book and a monkey-like figure in the background, is benign. While the artistic style incorporates angular forms, bold outlines, and some facial stylization, these are aesthetic choices rather than attempts to depict anything repulsive or aesthetically offensive in a way that generates physical or moral revulsion. The colors are muted and earthy, not jarring or nauseating. The overall impression is one of introspection or observation, not of something that would trigger an immediate and visceral feeling of aversion. Any discomfort arising from the abstract or distorted forms would likely fall into categories like unease or surprise, not disgust. Therefore, the score remains extremely low, acknowledging only the remotest, almost negligible, possibility of an idiosyncratic response that might misinterpret stylistic distortion as something genuinely off-putting."
gelmeroda-1936.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. The artwork's aesthetic is characterized by a cubist or geometric abstraction, primarily utilizing cool tones of blue, green, and muted grays, with subtle hints of warmer browns. Disgust, as an emotion, is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or morally reprehensible actions. None of these elements are present in the composition. The subject matter, an abstracted church tower and surrounding buildings, is inherently neutral and is not depicted in any manner that suggests putrefaction, unsanitary conditions, or any form of physical or moral repulsiveness. The fractured forms and layered colors create a contemplative and somewhat serene, albeit dynamic, visual experience, rather than one that provokes revulsion. There are no disturbing textures, sickly color combinations, or unsettling narratives that could contribute to a feeling of disgust. The overall impression is one of artistic exploration of form and color, entirely devoid of any content that would stimulate an aversion response."
haven-opus-2-1926.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork presents a clean, geometric, and stylized composition with a muted color palette. The forms are abstract, featuring smooth curves, circles, rectangles, and an arched structure, reminiscent perhaps of industrial elements or a dreamlike landscape. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or any traditionally repulsive imagery. The textures appear smooth, and the colors, while sometimes dark (like the upper right black area or the stormy sky), do not create a sense of decay or unpleasantness. The overall aesthetic is one of order and design, rather than chaos or anything that would trigger a visceral sensation of revulsion. There is no element that suggests sickness, contamination, moral outrage, or anything typically associated with the emotion of disgust."
green-squash-1948.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork is an abstract or semi-abstract still life, primarily depicting what appear to be flowers (represented by yellow and white forms) and possibly grapes (the dark cluster on the lower left) and other objects on a surface. The color palette consists of warm oranges, vibrant yellows, soft purples, and earthy browns and greens, none of which are inherently unpleasant or associated with decay, illness, or grime. The forms are fragmented and angular, characteristic of certain modern art movements, but they are not grotesque, distorted, or suggestive of anything repulsive. There are no depictions of gore, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, insects, or any other visual cues commonly associated with triggering disgust. The brushwork, while visible, does not convey a texture that would be tactilely unpleasant. The overall impression is one of artistic interpretation of a domestic subject, emphasizing form and color rather than narrative content that could be disturbing. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent."
golgotha-1912.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by ""The Green Christ"" by Marc Chagall. While the central figure depicts a crucifixion, a scene of suffering, the artistic rendering does not include any elements typically associated with visceral revulsion. The figure of Christ is rendered in a stylized blue hue, abstracting it from realistic depiction and thereby mitigating any potential for gruesome detail, blood, or gore that might elicit a physical sensation of disgust. The surrounding figures are also highly stylized and do not display any grotesque features, decay, or conditions that would trigger a response of revulsion. The color palette, dominated by vibrant greens and blues, along with reds and yellows, is rich and expressive, rather than presenting sickly, murky, or unpleasant combinations. The fragmented, Cubist-influenced forms contribute to a sense of dynamism and emotional weight, but they do not translate into imagery that is inherently repulsive or unsanitary. There are no depictions of waste, decay, or moral depravity that would instigate a feeling of disgust. The overall composition and symbolic nature of the work lead the viewer towards contemplation or perhaps sorrow, rather than the distinct feeling of disgust. The low score reflects the near absence of any visual cues that would trigger this particular emotion."
fruit-bowl-pipe-and-newspaper.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a Cubist still life, features a fragmented representation of common objects such as a newspaper, a glass, and possibly a pipe. Disgust is an emotion primarily triggered by sensory input perceived as revolting, unhygienic, contaminated, or morally offensive. There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that align with these common triggers. The fragmentation of forms is a stylistic characteristic of Cubism, an artistic technique used to explore multiple perspectives simultaneously, and not a depiction of decay, disfigurement, or anything inherently repulsive. The color palette, composed of muted greens, browns, whites, and blues, is visually stable and does not contain any jarring or sickly combinations that might induce a feeling of nausea or aversion. The subject matter itselfâinanimate household itemsâis neutral and lacks any inherent qualities that would provoke a visceral reaction of disgust. There is no suggestion of filth, spoilage, violence, or any grotesque imagery. The painting is an intellectual and formal exploration of perception and form, completely devoid of any content or presentation that could elicit an emotional response of disgust."
homage-to-mozart.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The artwork features a stylized bust of Mozart surrounded by musical instruments and abstract forms, rendered in a vibrant palette of reds, blues, yellows, and white. There are no elements within the composition that are inherently repulsive, grotesque, or offensive to the senses. The lines are clean, the colors are bright and energetic, and the subject matterâmusic and a revered composerâis generally associated with beauty, creativity, and cultural appreciation. There is no depiction of decay, violence, contamination, bodily fluids, suffering, or anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The artistic style, while abstract and interpretive, does not employ any visual strategies that aim to disturb or sicken the viewer. Therefore, the emotional response to this artwork is entirely devoid of disgust."
house-manhufe-1913.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, an abstracted landscape with a fortified structure and winding paths, contains no visual elements that would typically evoke disgust. There are no depictions of decay, filth, gore, disease, or any form of physical or moral repugnance. The color palette, consisting of earthy greens, browns, and muted oranges, is harmonious and does not suggest anything sickly or repulsive. The geometric abstraction, while perhaps challenging or disorienting to some viewers, does not inherently carry any connotations of disgust; it is a stylistic choice rather than a representation of something inherently unpleasant or offensive to the senses. The subject matterâa landscape with architecture and vegetationâis benign and offers no narrative or symbolic content that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. Therefore, the painting is devoid of any qualities that would provoke disgust in a viewer. The score is a nominal 0.5 to acknowledge the absolute impossibility of achieving a perfect zero in subjective emotional response, but it effectively communicates a complete absence of this emotion."
homage-to-gogol-design-for-curtain-for-gogol-festival-1917.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The artwork, characterized by its vibrant yellow background and stylized, elongated figure, evokes emotions related to artistic expression, literary homage (to Gogol by Chagall), and perhaps a sense of movement or surrealism. There are absolutely no visual elements present in this painting that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. The colors are bright and clean, not murky or suggestive of decay. The figure, while distorted in an artistic manner, is not grotesque, mutilated, or depicted in any state of filth, sickness, or putrefaction. There are no vile substances, offensive imagery, or unsettling details that would provoke a visceral feeling of revulsion or nausea. The overall impression is one of symbolic representation rather than anything physically or morally repugnant."
illustration-for-carmen-1932.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke a sense of disgust. The scene depicts a man observing a woman dancing, a common and often aesthetically pleasing subject in art. The figures themselves, their postures, and their expressions do not convey any revulsion or unpleasantness; the dancer appears absorbed in her movement, and the man watches intently, perhaps with admiration or fascination. The color palette is vibrant and appealing, featuring warm yellows and greens, rich purples, and calming blues and whites, none of which are associated with triggering disgust. Furthermore, there are no depicted objects, environments, or narrative elements (such as decay, filth, gore, or morally repugnant actions) that would typically elicit such an emotional response. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the artwork is one of performance, emotion, and visual interest, entirely devoid of any repulsive qualities."
head-of-a-man-1908-1.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The artwork does not evoke any sensation of disgust. The piece is a highly stylized, cubist-inspired portrait, focusing on the deconstruction and reassembly of facial forms. While the subject is not rendered realistically, the abstraction serves an intellectual and aesthetic purpose rather than depicting anything inherently repulsive or offensive. There are no elements within the paintingâsuch as gore, decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque physical deformities intended to evoke revulsion, or morally abhorrent subject matterâthat would trigger a feeling of disgust. The color palette, composed of muted blues, greens, and browns, while somber, does not suggest putrefaction or unhealthiness. The texture and brushwork are those of an oil painting, not mimicking anything slimy, festering, or otherwise viscerally unpleasant. The overall impression is one of formal artistic exploration and a contemplative, rather than repulsive, subject. Therefore, based purely on the visual information and the typical triggers for disgust, the score is zero."
il-lavoro-1951.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would evoke disgust. The scene depicts a group of stylized figures engaged in what appears to be collective labor or activity, possibly raising a pole. There is no imagery related to decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, disease, or anything rotten or contaminated. Furthermore, the actions depicted do not suggest any moral transgressions, cruelty, or suffering that might lead to an empathetic or ethical form of disgust. The color palette is earthy and vibrant, not sickly or unsettling. The abstract, cubist-inspired style of the figures and environment, while not aiming for photorealism, does not present anything grotesque or visually repulsive. The overall impression is one of dynamic effort, completely devoid of any stimuli typically associated with the emotion of disgust."
inca-with-birds-1933.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes a sense of disgust. The artwork features highly stylized, fragmented forms, reminiscent of Cubist or Vorticist styles, depicting figures, bird-like creatures (possibly owls), and a background with architectural elements and water. The color palette primarily consists of earthy tonesâvarious shades of brown, beige, and some muted blues and purples. Disgust is typically triggered by elements such as filth, decay, grotesque imagery, gore, disease, or subjects that are inherently repulsive. None of these elements are present here. The stylized nature of the figures, while abstract, does not render them grotesque or unsettling in a way that would cause revulsion. The birds appear benign, and the overall composition, despite its angularity, does not convey anything morally offensive or physically sickening. Therefore, based on the content, style, and subject matter, there is no discernible trigger for disgust."
head-1918.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, characterized by its cubist abstraction and bold use of geometric shapes and vibrant colors, presents no visual cues traditionally associated with eliciting disgust. Disgust is primarily a visceral emotion triggered by perceived threats of contamination, decay, bodily fluids, gore, or things that are overtly offensive to the senses.

Upon careful examination:
1.  **Absence of Decay or Contamination:** There are no elements suggesting rot, putrefaction, filth, disease, or any form of physical decay. The shapes are clean-edged and defined, and the textures, while varied, do not imply grubbiness or deterioration.
2.  **No Bodily Fluids or Waste:** The artwork does not depict any form of bodily excretions, fluids, or waste, which are common triggers for disgust.
3.  **Lack of Gore or Violence:** While the human form is fragmented and reassembled in an abstract manner, this fragmentation is purely formal and artistic, not suggestive of violence, injury, or the visceral reality of a body in distress. There is no blood, open wounds, or disfigurement in a grotesque sense.
4.  **Color Palette:** The colors usedâbright pink, various shades of green, blues, oranges, reds, and stark black and whiteâare bold and contrasting. While some might find the color combinations aesthetically jarring or unnatural, they do not possess the sickly, jaundiced, or putrid qualities often linked to disgust.
5.  **Subject Matter and Style:** The highly stylized and abstract nature of the ""figure"" or ""face"" invites intellectual engagement and aesthetic appreciation or critique rather than a gut reaction of revulsion. The deconstruction of the form is an artistic exploration of perception and dimension, not an attempt to render something repulsive or offensive.

In summary, the painting is aesthetically structured and compositionally clean. It lacks any of the conventional visual stimuliâsuch as depictions of organic decay, illness, physical repulsion, or disturbing grotesque elementsâthat would induce a feeling of disgust. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust to this artwork is effectively non-existent."
kmetty-janos-asztali-csendelet-1910-es-evek-kozepe-37-43.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting, a still life featuring a bowl of fruit, a bottle, a pitcher, and a framed image of two nude figures in the background, elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. The objects depicted are clean, wholesome, and arranged in an aesthetically pleasing manner. The fruit appears ripe and unblemished, showing no signs of decay, mold, or spoilage, which are common triggers for disgust. The bottle and pitcher are depicted as ordinary, clean vessels. The nude figures in the background are rendered in a classical, idealized manner, devoid of any grotesque features, injuries, or suggestive elements that could provoke a feeling of revulsion or moral offense. The colors used are muted blues, earthy reds, and whites, creating a calm and harmonious atmosphere rather than anything jarring or sickly. There is no depiction of filth, waste, disease, or anything that would activate a primal aversion response. The overall impression of the painting is one of tranquility and domestic beauty, entirely counter to any sensation of disgust."
interior-with-balcony-1928.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, rendered in a Cubist or post-Cubist style, features a figure with a guitar looking out onto a balcony and sky. There are no elements within the artwork that evoke a sensation of disgust. The subject matterâa musician, a room, an outdoor viewâis inherently neutral and lacks any visual cues typically associated with revulsion, such as decay, contamination, grotesque bodily forms, or unsanitary conditions. The fragmented and geometric forms, characteristic of the style, are an artistic interpretation of reality rather than a depiction of anything physically or morally repugnant. While the abstract nature might be unfamiliar or less aesthetically pleasing to some, it does not cross into the realm of the disgusting. The color palette, though varied, does not include hues or combinations that suggest illness, putrefaction, or other offensive qualities. There is no narrative implied that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or a strong aversion. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is virtually absent."
houses-in-munich-1909.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting contains no elements that evoke the emotion of disgust. There is no depiction of filth, decay, putrefaction, bodily fluids, gore, or anything unhygienic or morally reprehensible that would typically trigger a feeling of revulsion or nausea. The colors, while bold and expressionistic, are not sickly or off-putting in a way that would elicit disgust. The figures are stylized and simplified, lacking any grotesque features or actions. The overall scene, while perhaps conveying a sense of melancholy, starkness, or tension, does not present any visual cues associated with the specific emotion of disgust."
jack-of-hearts.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The art style, which features sharp angles and geometric fragmentation, creates a feeling of unease or intensity rather than revulsion. There are no elements within the visual content that would typically trigger disgust, such as depictions of decay, gore, filth, bodily fluids, disease, or anything overtly grotesque or unhygienic. The colors are muted and earthy with a striking red and yellow accent, none of which are sickly or repulsive. While the figure's fragmented appearance and sharp, star-like elements might convey a sense of struggle or aggression, these are not directly linked to the visceral reaction of disgust. The crow, though sometimes associated with darker themes, is depicted in a stylized manner that does not inspire revulsion. Overall, the artwork is more likely to elicit feelings of drama, melancholy, or intellectual curiosity due to its expressive form, but it fundamentally lacks any visual or thematic cues that would provoke a feeling of disgust."
kuntsevo-cottage-1919.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject matter, a house nestled among trees under a dramatic sky, is a common and often pleasant landscape theme. There are no elements within the painting that suggest decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, or any other traditionally repulsive imagery. The color palette, though expressive and vibrant with yellows, greens, and blues, does not employ sickly or putrid tones that might provoke an visceral negative reaction. Furthermore, the abstract and energetic brushwork, characteristic of an expressionist or Fauvist style, does not depict anything grotesque or unsettling in a manner that would trigger revulsion. The artistic choices, while perhaps eliciting other emotions such as awe, tranquility, or even a sense of dynamic energy, are entirely devoid of any visual cues that would lead to a feeling of disgust."
l-oiseau-1915.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork presents a clean, stylized, and vibrant scene. The geometric shapes, bright and varied color palette (including cheerful pastels and bold primary hues), and the whimsical subjectsâcolorful buildings, a serene blue bird, and clean green foliageâare aesthetically pleasing and devoid of any elements typically associated with revulsion. There are no depictions of decay, filth, disease, unsettling textures, gore, or anything visually offensive or morally repugnant. The overall impression is one of calm, modernity, and perhaps a touch of fantasy, all of which are antithetical to the emotion of disgust. The composition is orderly, and the execution appears deliberate and clean, further preventing any sense of unpleasantness or discomfort that might lead to disgust."
la-femme-au-gu-ridon-et-au-fer-cheval-1928.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The artwork, with its cubist and surrealist influences, presents abstract and stylized figures and objects. There are no visual elements within the painting that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. The forms are smooth and rounded, not grotesque, decaying, or depicting any bodily fluids or putrefaction. The color palette, predominantly muted blues, grays, and earthy tones, does not contain hues that are commonly associated with nausea or revulsion. While the composition is complex and perhaps thought-provoking, there is nothing inherently unclean, contaminated, or morally repugnant portrayed. The figures, though abstract, do not convey suffering or an image that would elicit a visceral negative reaction of disgust. The overall aesthetic leans towards intellectual contemplation rather than physical or moral revulsion. A very low score is appropriate as there's virtually no content that could be interpreted as disgusting."
komposition-med-noter-1921.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting, an abstract or Cubist-inspired still life centered around musical themes, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The overall composition is fragmented and vibrant, utilizing a palette of greens, grays, reds, yellows, and browns. While some textures are unconventional, they do not read as repulsive or unsanitary. For instance, the yellowish-brown rectangular element in the upper center has a raised, somewhat irregular surface, but it appears to be a textural application or a collage element rather than something decaying or foul. Similarly, the framed rectangular object in the lower central part contains small, dark, and red granular elements. While these could potentially be misinterpreted as something like insects or decaying matter if viewed in isolation and without context, within the artistic framework of a still life, they more strongly suggest materials like beads, seeds, or berries used for their visual and textural quality, not for their capacity to provoke revulsion. There are no depictions of gore, filth, decay, grotesque figures, or anything that would typically trigger an emotion of disgust. The slight score of 2.0 acknowledges the *possibility* of a fleeting, mistaken interpretation of the granular textures by a viewer overly sensitive to such forms, but it is a highly unlikely and not intended response given the artistic context and lack of overt repulsive cues."
landscape-of-falaise-1910.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting does not evoke any sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with feelings of revulsion, aversion, or contamination, often triggered by decay, filth, or something perceived as inherently offensive or unwholesome. The artwork depicts a landscape with buildings and trees, rendered in a somewhat expressionistic or cubist-influenced style with visible brushstrokes and bold colors. While the style might not appeal to everyone's aesthetic preferences, there is absolutely nothing in the subject matter, color palette (earthy reds, yellows, greens, blues), or composition that suggests anything repulsive, unsanitary, or vile. The imagery is clean and stylized, presenting a view of a built environment amidst nature without any elements that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or nausea. The score is not a flat zero to account for the infinitesimally small chance that someone might have a highly idiosyncratic and unconventional association, but for all practical purposes, there is no discernible disgust present."
landscape-near-martigues-1908.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork presents an abstract or semi-abstract landscape, characterized by simplified forms, bold colors, and strong lines depicting hills, fields, trees, and a body of water in the distance. There are no grotesque, repulsive, or sickening forms; no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, or any other subject matter typically associated with disgust. The colors, while ranging from deep greens and blues to earthy oranges and browns, are not jarring or sickly in a way that would provoke an adverse physiological or emotional response. The composition is structured and almost geometric, creating an aesthetic that is far removed from anything that might be considered offensive or stomach-churning. The painting is purely an artistic interpretation of a landscape, devoid of any content that could be interpreted as unhygienic, morally repugnant, or physically nauseating."
landscape.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The subject matter depicts a rather ordinary landscape scene with houses, trees, and a road under a cloudy sky. There are no elements that suggest decay, contamination, filth, moral corruption, bodily fluids, or anything visually repulsive or offensive. The colors are earthy and subdued, contributing to a somewhat somber or moody atmosphere, but not to a feeling of revulsion. The brushwork, while visible and somewhat raw, does not portray anything grotesque or unpleasant. The composition, though dynamic with its diagonals, does not disorient or disturb in a way that would trigger a visceral negative reaction. Disgust is typically a response to something perceived as unclean, harmful, or morally reprehensible, none of which are present in this artwork."
lemons-1929.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, a still life featuring a jug, a glass, lemons, and a pear on a platter, presents no elements that would typically evoke disgust. The subject matter itselfâcommon household objects and fruitâis benign and devoid of any inherently repulsive or unsettling qualities. The colors used are generally warm and earthy (yellows, browns, greens) alongside whites and grays, none of which are suggestive of decay, illness, or putrefaction. The artistic style, which leans towards a fragmented or cubist approach, simplifies and abstracts the forms, but this stylization does not render the objects grotesque or distorted in a manner that would trigger revulsion. There are no depictions of filth, gore, decay, or anything that might stimulate a visceral negative reaction. The overall impression is one of formal artistic exploration rather than an attempt to disturb or sicken the viewer. The score is a negligible 0.5, acknowledging that an absolute zero is difficult to assign to any human response, but effectively indicating no discernible presence of disgust."
love-1910.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The image, titled ""L'Amour"" (Love), depicts two figures intimately embracing within a lush, stylized natural setting. The woodcut medium, characterized by strong black and white contrasts and bold lines, lends a raw yet artistic quality to the scene. There are no elements within the artwork that evoke disgust. The subject matter of love and intimacy is generally considered positive or neutral, and the depiction itself is serene and romantic, not grotesque, vulgar, or unsettling. There are no signs of decay, filth, disease, moral transgression, or anything visually repulsive. The surrounding flora and fauna (flowers, butterflies) further contribute to a sense of natural beauty and tranquility. The artistic style, while striking, does not present any distorted or unpleasant forms that would trigger a feeling of revulsion."
man-and-woman-1926.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The artwork features a clean, stylized aesthetic with a central white figure set against a serene blue background, resting on a bold red base. The colors are vibrant and clear, and the forms are abstract and simplified. There are no elements typically associated with disgust, such as decay, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, violence, or anything inherently unpleasant or repulsive. The composition is orderly, and the subject matter, while abstract, does not suggest any moral or physical revulsion. The overall impression is one of calm and artistic abstraction, entirely devoid of any qualities that would trigger a feeling of aversion or nausea."
landscape-study-for-composition-xii-1918.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The artwork, characterized by its stark black and white palette and bold, angular lines, does not inherently contain elements typically associated with evoking disgust. There is no explicit depiction of gore, decay, filth, grotesque figures, or any subject matter that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or nausea. The abstract nature of the forms, which appear to depict a fragmented landscape or cityscape, focuses on composition, line, and contrast rather than representational content that might be offensive. While the dense, almost chaotic black shapes in the upper section and the fragmented forms could be interpreted as unsettling or visually jarring to some, these qualities lean more towards a sense of abstract energy or perhaps unease, rather than the profound aversion or moral condemnation that defines disgust. The raw, unrefined quality of the brushstrokes, while not traditionally beautiful, also doesn't cross into the realm of the repulsive. Therefore, any sensation of disgust stemming from this image would be extremely minimal, if present at all, as it lacks the common visual or thematic triggers for this emotion."
lucky-strike-1921.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting, an abstract and Cubist-influenced advertisement for Lucky Strike tobacco by Stuart Davis, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The artwork utilizes bold, clean lines, geometric shapes, and a palette of vibrant and rich colors such as dark green, red, orange, and blue. These elements are arranged in a dynamic and visually engaging composition that emphasizes modernity and design. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, disease, or things that are inherently repulsive or offensive to the senses. This painting presents none of these characteristics. The forms are crisp and well-defined, the colors are strong and purposeful rather than sickly or murky, and the overall aesthetic is one of deliberate artistic construction rather than chaos or putrefaction. While the product advertised (tobacco) might be associated with negative health outcomes for some viewers, the *painting itself* does not depict any of these negative consequences or aspects that would illicit a visceral reaction of disgust. It is a highly stylized and almost architectural representation of a commercial product, designed to be visually appealing and progressive, not repulsive. The visual information conveyed is clean, sharp, and aesthetically composed, offering nothing that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or nausea."
machinery.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, with its sharp angles, fragmented forms, and strong industrial theme, does not inherently evoke feelings of disgust. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or morally repugnant acts that are typically associated with this emotion. The machinery is depicted as clean and functional, albeit in a highly stylized manner. The human-like figures are integrated into the mechanical landscape, but their stylized nature, while perhaps unsettling or dehumanizing to some, does not cross into the realm of the repulsive or nauseating. The colors are vibrant and orderly, further contributing to a sense of controlled power rather than revulsion. Any minimal presence of discomfort might arise from a highly abstract interpretation of the human form being subsumed by the machine, potentially leading to a very slight, intellectualized sense of aversion to a perceived loss of humanity, but this is far from the visceral feeling of disgust."
madonna.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The artwork presents no visual elements that would typically elicit a sensation of disgust. There are no depictions of gore, decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything physically repulsive. The color palette, while varied with brights, muted tones, and dark areas, does not combine in a way that feels aesthetically jarring or unpleasant enough to trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. Furthermore, as an abstract composition of geometric and organic shapes, there is no discernible subject matter or narrative that could be interpreted as morally reprehensible or offensive. The collaged textures, appearing to be patterned fabric or wallpaper, are decorative and innocuous, not grotesque or off-putting. The overall impression is one of artistic arrangement and color exploration, entirely devoid of characteristics commonly associated with the emotion of disgust."
le-d-jeuner-pr-s-du-phare-1928.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The forms, while abstracted and surreal, do not depict anything inherently repulsive or grotesque. There are no elements of decay, bodily fluids, violence, or unhygienic conditions that typically trigger this emotion. The colors are muted and generally harmonious, lacking the sickly or jarring tones often associated with visually disgusting imagery. While some shapes are organic and ambiguous, such as the pinkish-red forms in the center, their stylized and clean execution prevents them from being interpreted as genuinely visceral or off-putting. They resemble abstract sculptures or objects rather than decaying matter or bodily organs in a repulsive state. The overall aesthetic is one of intellectual play and formal experimentation, rather than an attempt to provoke a visceral, negative emotional response like disgust. Any potential for disgust is extremely minimal and would rely on an overly sensitive or strained interpretation of abstract forms as unsettling organic material, which is not the dominant reading of the work."
marika-with-her-dog-and-cats-1968.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes disgust. The scene depicts a woman relaxing in a chair, reading, with her pets (two cats and a dog) nearby, and a vase of flowers. The subject matter is entirely domestic and serene. The partial nudity of the woman is presented in an artistic and unprovocative manner, and the animals are depicted peacefully. There are no elements of decay, filth, grotesque imagery, violence, moral repugnance, or any sensory details (implied or explicit) that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or nausea. The colors are vibrant, the composition is balanced, and the overall impression is one of calm and everyday life."
man-s-head.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, a Cubist or Expressionist portrait, does not inherently contain elements typically associated with eliciting disgust. There is no depiction of gore, bodily fluids, decay, filth, disease, or any subject matter that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or nausea. The colors, while somewhat muted and earthy with bold accents of yellow and purple, do not convey a sense of putrefaction or unhealthiness. The texture, created by thick impasto and visible brushstrokes, might be described as rough or raw, but not inherently disgusting. The subject's features are highly abstracted and distorted, particularly the eyes, nose, and mouth, which can create a feeling of unease or unsettlement due to their unconventional representation. However, this feeling of 'unsettling' or 'confrontational' is distinct from true disgust. While some viewers might find the overall aesthetic a little 'grimy' due to the dark tones and heavy application, this falls short of evoking genuine repulsion or loathing. The piece seems more designed to provoke contemplation or a sense of intensity rather than to cause aversion."
metronome.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting, a Cubist composition featuring fragmented forms, text, and abstract mechanical elements, offers virtually no visual cues that would elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by sensory input related to contamination, decay, bodily fluids, unsanitary conditions, or morally reprehensible acts presented in a visceral way. None of these elements are present here. The color palette, while varied, does not employ sickly or unappealing combinations. The forms are abstract and mechanical, lacking any organic decay or repulsive textures. The fragmented text and symbols (""FRANCE,"" ""ANGLETERRE,"" ""AMERIQUE,"" ""PARIS,"" a question mark, and some Russian text) hint at geopolitical or intellectual themes, but their presentation is cerebral and aestheticized, not visceral or revolting. While the fragmented nature of Cubism can sometimes be disorienting or challenging, it does not inherently provoke disgust. There is no representation of anything putrid, grotesque, or otherwise offensive to the senses or moral sensibilities. The minimal score acknowledges the remote possibility of an extremely idiosyncratic personal aversion to the artistic style or combination of elements, but objectively, the artwork contains no content typically associated with the emotion of disgust."
milliners-workshop-of-the-milliner-1926.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting, rendered in a Cubist style with a monochromatic palette of greys, blacks, and whites, offers very little to evoke a sense of disgust. There is no imagery depicting bodily fluids, decay, gore, filth, or anything physically repulsive that typically triggers this emotion. The fragmented and abstract representation of figures and objects inherently distances the viewer from any direct, visceral response that might stem from realistic depiction of unpleasantness. The muted color scheme contributes to a solemn or intellectual mood rather than one that would cause revulsion. Furthermore, there are no narrative clues or explicit expressions on the stylized figures that suggest moral depravity, cruelty, or any behavior that would be ethically offensive. While the fragmented forms could be perceived as somewhat unsettling or disorienting due to their non-naturalistic representation, this sensation does not translate into disgust. The artwork primarily engages with intellectual and formal concerns, offering no content designed to be physically or morally repulsive."
nature-morte-1926.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a Cubist still life, presents a composition of a guitar, a bottle, and a pear on a table. None of these depicted objects are presented in a manner that suggests decay, putrefaction, unsanitary conditions, or any other quality typically associated with eliciting disgust. The colors used â various shades of brown, black, white, blue, and ochre â are muted and do not evoke feelings of sickness or repulsion. The fragmented forms characteristic of Cubism are an artistic stylistic choice and do not render the objects as physically grotesque, contaminated, or visually offensive in a way that would induce revulsion. There are no disturbing textures, foul imagery, or explicit content that would trigger a visceral sense of unpleasantness or strong disapproval. The overall impression is one of artistic interpretation and abstraction rather than anything remotely disgusting."
men-in-the-city-1919.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, ""Three Women (Le Grand DÃ©jeuner)"" by Fernand LÃ©ger, is characterized by its bold, geometric forms, stylized figures, and clean lines. The aesthetic is often described as ""Purist"" or ""machine aesthetic,"" reflecting an interest in modern industrial forms. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things perceived as unhygienic, contaminated, decaying, grotesque, or morally repugnant, often eliciting a strong aversion or feeling of revulsion.

In this artwork, there are very few elements that would typically provoke a feeling of disgust.
1.  **Cleanliness and Order:** The composition is highly structured and clean. The forms, though abstracted, are smooth and polished, resembling machine parts or idealized, non-organic shapes. There is no depiction of dirt, decay, or messiness.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors are relatively vibrant and distinct (blues, reds, yellows, whites, blacks). There are no sickly, muted, or unsettling color combinations that might suggest illness or decay.
3.  **Figurative Representation:** While the figures are depersonalized and somewhat robotic, this style tends to evoke feelings of detachment, impersonality, or perhaps an uncanny valley effect for some viewers, rather than disgust. They are not grotesque, malformed in a sickening way, or depicted with any bodily fluids or violations that would trigger revulsion. Their nudity is stylized and aestheticized, not presented in a way that is crude, vulgar, or designed to provoke disgust.
4.  **Subject Matter:** The scene appears to be a domestic interior with figures engaged in leisure. There is no narrative or symbolic content that suggests violence, cruelty, contamination, or anything morally offensive that would lead to disgust.

The slight score of 5 (rather than 0) acknowledges that for a very small minority of viewers, the extreme stylization and dehumanization of the figures, stripping them of traditional organic warmth and individual character, *might* evoke a minor sense of unease or revulsion at the perceived ""unnaturalness"" or ""coldness"" of the human form reduced to geometric components. However, this is a highly subjective and marginal interpretation, and the primary emotional response intended or typically experienced is not disgust. Overall, the painting's formal qualities and subject matter are largely devoid of the common triggers for this emotion."
not_detected_227965.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke the emotion of disgust. The scene depicts a vibrant, well-kept landscape with a town in the background, a cultivated garden, and a man engaged in labor. The colors are bright and earthy, conveying a sense of life and growth rather than decay or sickness. There is no depiction of grime, filth, waste, bodily fluids, gore, disease, or anything that would trigger a visceral sensation of repulsion or aversion. The water flowing from the pipe appears clear and functional, not stagnant or contaminated. The figures and architecture are stylized but not distorted in a way that suggests anything grotesque or repulsive. The overall impression is one of order, industry, and natural beauty, completely devoid of any cues that might lead to feelings of disgust."
no-name-2(1).jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke a sense of disgust. The artwork depicts powerful, muscular human figures and horses in dynamic poses, rendered with vibrant, non-naturalistic colors. While the style is expressionistic and raw, it does not feature any imagery typically associated with disgust, such as bodily fluids, decay, gore, disease, filth, or any morally reprehensible acts presented in a way that would cause visceral revulsion. The nudity of the figures appears to be part of the raw, primal energy of the scene, rather than being presented in a lewd or offensive manner that would incite disgust. The overall impression is one of energy, struggle, and a connection with elemental forces, not something repulsive or sickening."
nu-au-soleil-nude-in-the-sun-1935.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke feelings of disgust. The artwork depicts a classical-inspired female figure, rendered with a stylized, almost cubist sensibility, in what appears to be an architectural setting overlooking a landscape. The figure itself is not distorted, diseased, grotesque, or in any way repulsive. Her form is voluminous but gracefully posed. The partial drapery is handled tastefully, devoid of vulgarity or offense. The color palette is composed of muted, earthy tones and cool blues, which are aesthetically pleasing and do not conjure any sense of sickness or decay. The background elements, including the distant buildings and mountains, and the foreground objects like the flowers and bowl of fruit, are all benign and wholesome, suggesting abundance and nature rather than anything putrid or vile. There is no gore, bodily fluids, decay, unsanitary conditions, or any other common triggers for disgust present in the imagery or the execution of the painting. The overall impression is one of calm, contemplation, and classical beauty, standing in stark opposition to any sensation of revulsion."
militiaman-and-merchant-sketch-of-costumes-for-the-play-footballer.jpg,Cubism,38.0,"The primary element contributing to a sense of disgust is the prominent, realistically rendered bee (or wasp) placed squarely on the chest of the right-hand figure. For many individuals, insects, especially those associated with stinging or being pests, can trigger a primal feeling of aversion or disgust, particularly when depicted in such an unnatural and almost parasitic way on a human form. This feeling is heightened by the stark contrast between the bee's realistic detail and the highly abstracted, geometric style of the human figures.

Furthermore, aspects of the right figure's stylized anatomy can contribute to a subtle sense of the grotesque or unsettling, bordering on mild revulsion. The breasts are depicted as detached, almost target-like pink circles, creating an uncanny and unnatural representation of the body that can be unsettling. The overall fragmentation and reassembly of the figure's formâwith disjointed limbs, a disproportionate red nose, and a dark, claw-like handâcontribute to a feeling of the body being ""wrong"" or deformed in a way that can trigger discomfort or a slight sense of repulsion rather than mere aesthetic disinterest. While not overtly gory or filthy, the painting's deliberate juxtaposition of elements and its departure from naturalistic representation create an unsettling visual experience that can lean towards a mild, visceral feeling of disgust for some viewers."
mountaineers-attacked-by-bears-1912.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this painting. There are no overt depictions of filth, gore, decay, or anything physically repulsive. The subject matter itself, appearing to be a crowded indoor scene possibly a bar or gathering, does not inherently suggest anything disgusting.

However, a very slight degree of aesthetic aversion, which can be a mild form of disgust, might arise from a few subtle elements. The painting's highly fragmented and chaotic Cubist-like style creates a sense of visual disorder and clutter. For viewers who prefer clarity, order, or traditional beauty, this dense and jumbled composition could be mildly overwhelming or even ""messy"" to the point of being aesthetically unappealing, triggering a very faint sense of discomfort or aversion akin to revulsion at disarray.

Furthermore, some of the highly abstracted figures, particularly the central one with the prominent, elongated facial features that appear almost grotesque or caricatured, could be perceived as visually unpleasing or even unsettling by certain sensibilities. This departure from conventional attractiveness, while not explicitly vile, might nudge a viewer toward a very minor degree of aesthetic disgust rather than appreciation. The overall muted and somewhat muddy color palette, while not inherently disgusting, also contributes to a general lack of visual appeal that might prevent any positive aesthetic response, thus leaving room for a slight negative one for some viewers. Nonetheless, these elements are far from eliciting a strong, visceral reaction typically associated with disgust."
paris-roofs-ii-1952.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting is an abstract, geometric composition primarily depicting fragmented architectural forms using muted pastel colors such as greens, blues, browns, purples, and pinks. The lines are clean and well-defined, and the overall impression is one of order within abstraction. There is absolutely nothing in the imageryâno depicted decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, violence, or morally repugnant contentâthat could possibly trigger a sensation of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with visceral aversion to offensive substances or morally reprehensible actions. This artwork presents none of these characteristics; it is aesthetically clean, formal, and non-representational in a way that precludes any such negative physiological or moral response. Therefore, a score of 0.0 is appropriate, indicating a complete absence of disgust."
orange-vendor-spain.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, ""The Harvesters"" by Natalia Goncharova, presents no visual or thematic elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The subject matter, depicting stylized figures engaged in agricultural work and carrying baskets of produce, is inherently benign and even celebratory of labor and abundance. The fruits and items depicted appear wholesome and fresh, offering no suggestion of decay, spoilage, or unhygienic conditions. The color palette is vibrant and rich, utilizing bright yellows, greens, blues, and reds, which contribute to an energetic and visually appealing aesthetic rather than anything repulsive or off-putting. The artistic style, characterized by its Cubo-Futurist influence with geometric forms and fragmented perspectives, is a stylistic choice that, while distinct, does not convey anything grotesque, repulsive, or sickening. There are no depictions of gore, bodily fluids, filth, violence, suffering, or morally objectionable content that would trigger a visceral or moral sense of revulsion. The overall impression is one of dynamism and vitality, completely devoid of any stimuli typically associated with disgust."
pink-figure-wizard.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting presents a stylized figure, possibly an athlete or a futuristic persona, rendered with angular forms and a distinct color palette of browns, greens, and muted tones. There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that would elicit a feeling of disgust. The subject matter is not grotesque, repulsive, or inherently unpleasant; it does not depict decay, filth, violence, injury, or any other commonly recognized triggers for disgust. The colors are earthy and harmonious, not sickly or jarring. The composition is balanced, and the figure's expression, while stylized, does not convey pain, suffering, or any emotion that might be off-putting. The artwork appears to be an exploration of form and color, possibly conveying themes of strength, contemplation, or a modernized human form, none of which align with feelings of revulsion. The very low score reflects the complete absence of any visual cues or narrative implications that could lead to disgust."
night-ceremony.jpg,Cubism,62.5,"The painting evokes a notable degree of disgust, primarily stemming from the depiction of animal slaughter and raw meat processing. The most significant element contributing to this emotion is located in the bottom left corner, where a clearly identifiable animal (likely a pig) lies on its back, apparently gutted or opened, with a reddish-brown stain beneath it, strongly implying blood. While the artistic style is stylized and not hyper-realistic, which mitigates the immediate visceral impact, the subject matter itself â a dead animal in this state â is inherently disturbing and can trigger feelings of revulsion or unpleasantness in many viewers.

Further contributing to the sense of disgust are the raw cuts of meat on the table in front of the standing figure. Although appearing as clean cuts, the sheer quantity and raw state, especially in an open-air, somewhat informal setting, can create a minor sense of unease or messiness. The presence of a bucket near the figure's feet, appearing to contain dark, reddish material (possibly offal or bloody scraps), reinforces the messy and crude aspects of butchery, adding to the overall feeling of things being unclean or potentially unpleasant.

However, several factors prevent the disgust score from being higher. The painting's stylized, almost tapestry-like quality and abstracted forms reduce the direct, graphic impact. There is no explicit rendering of gore, detailed internal organs, or overt signs of decay (like flies or putrefaction) that would induce a stronger physical recoil. The overall color palette, though including reds and browns, is muted, further dampening the visceral quality."
pillars-of-salt.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. There are no visual elements that depict decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or anything traditionally associated with a physical sensation of revulsion. The figures, while stylized and somewhat abstract, are rendered in clean, cool tones of blue and white, set against warm reds and oranges. Their forms are solid and sculptural, not sickly or distorted in a way that would trigger an aversive reaction. The expressions, though simplified, appear contemplative, serene, or even gently smiling, rather than conveying any negative emotional state that might be contagious or unsettling. The overall atmosphere is one of calm, solemnity, or even reverence, which is antithetical to feelings of disgust. There is nothing in the subject matter, composition, color palette, or execution that presents as offensive, repulsive, or inherently unpleasant in a way that would elicit a feeling of disgust."
portrait-dulcinea-1911.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, featuring several stylized, elongated female figures in a warm, earthy palette, evokes no sense of disgust. There is nothing in the subject matter, composition, or color scheme that is repulsive, contaminating, grotesque, or morally offensive. The figures are depicted in a serene, almost contemplative manner, and while abstractly rendered, they do not suggest decay, illness, or any form of physical or moral unpleasantness. The colors are harmonious and inviting, not sickly or putrid. Therefore, there are no visual cues present that would trigger a feeling of disgust."
planches-de-salut-1931.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The artwork, rendered in a monochromatic, heavily cross-hatched style, depicts an interior space that is stark, angular, and somewhat austere. While the deep shadows and the abstract, somewhat elongated figure on the left might contribute to a sense of unease or mystery, there are no visual cues within the composition that directly evoke the sensation of disgust. There is an absence of elements typically associated with this emotion, such as filth, decay, grotesque forms, or imagery that suggests contamination or biological repulsion. The deliberate artistic style, while creating a distinct mood, does not employ textures, forms, or subject matter that are inherently repulsive or sickening. The implied narrative or atmosphere might lean towards the psychological or unsettling, but this is distinct from eliciting a visceral feeling of disgust. The score is very low because the artwork does not present anything physically repellent, aesthetically offensive in a disgusting way, or morally depraved in a manner that would induce revulsion."
portrait-de-j-l-b.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The geometric fragmentation and abstract nature of the forms, while potentially unsettling or intriguing, do not depict anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. There are no elements of gore, decay, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or morally reprehensible actions conveyed. The colors are muted and earthy, not contributing to any feeling of sickness or repulsion. The textures appear to be painterly and structured, not slimy, viscous, or otherwise unpleasant to imagine touching. The fragmented 'face' at the top, if interpreted as such, is stylized and not grotesque or distorted in a way that would cause nausea or aversion. Disgust is typically a protective emotion against something harmful to ingest or encounter, and nothing in this artwork suggests such a threat or unpleasantness."
portrait-of-albert-gleizes-1912.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, a Cubist portrait, presents a fragmented and geometric interpretation of a human figure, possibly two overlapping figures. While the deconstruction of the subject's form might be perceived as unconventional or even unsettling to some who prefer realistic representation, it does not evoke a sensation of disgust. Disgust typically arises from revulsion towards something perceived as offensive, repulsive, unclean, or morally corrupt. This artwork contains none of these elements. The colors are generally muted and harmonious, lacking any jarring or sickening combinations. There are no grotesque details, bodily fluids, signs of decay, or disturbing imagery that would trigger a visceral feeling of revulsion. The fragmentation is an artistic choice, representing multiple perspectives simultaneously, rather than a depiction of injury or decay that would naturally provoke disgust. The overall intellectual and analytical approach of Cubism tends to distance the viewer from raw emotional responses like disgust, favoring instead contemplation of form and perspective. Any minimal score is attributed to the abstract nature potentially being off-putting to some, but not in a truly disgusting manner."
portrait-of-a-stylist-germinal-rangel.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this painting for its capacity to evoke disgust, I find no discernible elements that would trigger such an emotion. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, filth, disease, grotesqueness, moral depravity, or highly offensive imagery. This artwork presents none of these characteristics. The composition features a central figure, a Siamese cat, a tortoise, and a bowl of fruit, all rendered in a clean, pointillist style. The colors are generally muted and harmonious, dominated by blues, greens, and earthy tones, which do not clash or create any sense of visual discomfort. The subject matter itself â a person in a tranquil setting with animals and fresh fruit â is inherently benign and wholesome, rather than repulsive or unsettling. There are no distorted features, unpleasant textures, or themes of suffering or decay that would elicit a visceral reaction of revulsion. The meticulous dot-by-dot application of paint, while unique, does not contribute to feelings of disgust; instead, it provides a distinctive, almost shimmering quality to the surface. Consequently, the painting registers at the absolute lowest end of the disgust spectrum, indicating a complete absence of any visual stimuli associated with this emotion."
portrait-of-manuel-pallares-1909.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork is a portrait of a man, rendered in a distinctive early Cubist style characterized by angular forms and planes. While the style deviates from strict realism, it does not distort the subject into anything grotesque, decaying, or inherently repulsive. The color palette consists of natural, muted earth tones (browns, ochres, greys), which are neither sickly nor unsettling. There are no visual cues typically associated with disgust, such as depictions of filth, bodily fluids, decay, disease, injury, or morally reprehensible actions. The man's expression is neutral, and the overall composition is one of formal artistic exploration rather than a representation of anything unpleasant or offensive. The dedication at the top (""A mi queridisimo amigo Pallares"") further reinforces that the painting is a respectful and perhaps affectionate portrayal, completely devoid of any intent or visual content that would provoke revulsion."
portrait-of-the-artist.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting, a Cubist or Futurist portrait, features a man with stylized, angular features. While the artistic style distorts reality, there are no elements within the depiction that inherently evoke disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues of decay, disease, bodily fluids, grotesque disfigurement, or morally repugnant acts. None of these are present. The colors are vibrant and clean, the textures do not suggest anything repulsive, and the subject's expression, though abstracted, does not convey anything morally offensive or physically sickening. The angularity of the features and the fragmentation of the background are artistic choices, not representations of anything inherently disgusting. The slightly open, stylized mouth, while unusual, does not suggest a wound or decay. Therefore, the feeling of disgust is almost entirely absent."
peasant-woman-with-buckets-and-a-child.jpg,Cubism,3.0,"The painting, with its stylized and somewhat distorted figures, does not inherently evoke a strong sense of disgust. There are no explicit visual cues typically associated with this emotion, such as gore, decay, filth, bodily fluids, or overt signs of disease. The figures, while depicted with large, simplified features and forms common in expressionistic or primitivist art, are not portrayed as grotesque in a manner intended to trigger revulsion or suggest contamination. Their bare feet and simple clothing might imply a rustic or laborious existence, but there is no depiction of dirt, grime, or poor hygiene on their persons that would trigger a visceral response of disgust. The overall emotional tone conveyed by the figures leans more towards stoicism, burden, or weariness, which might elicit empathy or contemplation rather than repulsion. Any slight discomfort or aversion a viewer might experience would likely stem from a personal aesthetic preference for more conventional or idealized beauty, rather than a true feeling of disgust for the subject matter"
portrait-of-the-writer-m-doleng-1929.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke the emotion of disgust. The artwork depicts a seated man in a stylized manner, characterized by strong outlines, geometric forms, and distinct color blocking. There is no depiction of gore, decay, filth, illness, or anything that would typically trigger a visceral sensation of revulsion. The color palette, while bold in its use of reds and blues alongside more muted tones, does not convey anything putrid or offensive. The facial expression, though somewhat obscured by the downward gaze, shows no sign of distress or a reaction to something repulsive. The hands, while featuring a similar red accent as the face, are simply clasped and do not suggest any form of injury or unpleasantness. The overall aesthetic is one of artistic interpretation rather than a portrayal of anything inherently disgusting."
rain-1929.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting is a Cubist still life, characterized by its geometric fragmentation and a palette of muted, earthy tones alongside cool blues and greens. The subject matter appears to be various loaves of bread and a goblet or chalice. There is absolutely nothing within the visual representation of this artwork that could evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by perceptions of contamination, decay, unpleasant bodily fluids, or morally repulsive acts. This painting, however, presents clean, stylized forms and common, wholesome objects. The colors are not sickly or nauseating, nor are there any textures or details that suggest putrefaction, filth, or anything offensive to the senses. The artistic style aims to deconstruct and reassemble form, which is an intellectual and aesthetic pursuit, not one designed to provoke a visceral negative reaction like disgust. Consequently, there is no element in this artwork that would elicit such an emotional response."
portrait-of-p-denike-yuriev-and-a-pokrovsky-1913.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting presents no visual cues or subject matter typically associated with eliciting the emotion of disgust. The artwork features two stylized figures, likely men, rendered with angular forms and bold colors characteristic of an expressionistic or early modernist style. While the faces exhibit some artistic distortion, such as simplified features and pronounced jawlines, this is a stylistic choice rather than a depiction of physical decay, illness, grotesque deformity, or uncleanliness that would trigger revulsion. There are no elements related to filth, bodily fluids, moral transgression, or anything offensive to the senses. The subjects are clothed and appear in a formal, albeit abstract, setting. Consequently, the painting does not evoke any sense of revulsion, aversion, or nausea typically associated with disgust."
red-jew-1915.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting does not inherently evoke strong feelings of disgust. There are no depicted elements that are typically associated with revulsion, such as decay, filth, bodily fluids, or explicit violence. The colors are vibrant and, while some features are stylized and exaggerated (like the red beard or the slightly distorted face), they do not cross into the realm of being grotesque or repulsive in a way that would trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. The man's weary or melancholic expression and the abstract, somewhat unsettling background might evoke feelings of unease or sadness for some viewers, but these are distinct from disgust. The score of 2.5 acknowledges a very minimal, almost negligible potential for a viewer to find the slightly asymmetrical or unconventional portrayal of the human form as mildly ""off"" or unsettling, which in a very abstract and diluted sense *could* touch upon a subtle aversion, but it is far from a true feeling of disgust."
red-ocean-blue-1915.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting, an abstract representation of a face composed of vibrant colors and geometric shapes, elicits virtually no sensation of disgust. There are no visual elements commonly associated with this emotion, such as decay, filth, gore, bodily fluids, or grotesque and unsettling realism. The colors are bright and varied, not muddy or sickly. While the facial features are fragmented and rearranged in a cubist manner, they do not appear deformed in a repulsive way. The overall composition is dynamic but lacks any content or texture that would provoke a visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea. The abstract nature of the artwork tends to invite intellectual curiosity rather than primal emotional responses like disgust."
relief.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"The painting, an abstract work composed of geometric forms and vibrant colors, presents no visual cues commonly associated with the emotion of disgust. There is no depiction of repulsive subject matter such as decay, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or grotesque figures. The colors, though varied and at times contrasting, are generally clean and bright (red, white, blue, orange, green, black), and do not suggest putrefaction or illness. The sharp, angular forms do not evoke unpleasant tactile sensations like sliminess or stickiness, nor do they suggest anything distorted or vile. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, it does not convey narratives or themes that would trigger moral or ethical revulsion. The overall impression is one of formal exploration of shape, color, and perhaps movement, none of which inherently provoke a visceral reaction of disgust. The score is minimally above zero to account for the infinitesimally small chance of an extremely rare and highly personal idiosyncratic response, but objectively, the artwork contains no elements designed to, or that would typically, elicit disgust."
san-giacomo-di-varallo-1924.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, depicting a stylized village nestled within a landscape, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject matter itselfâa serene arrangement of buildings, a bridge, and a river surrounded by trees and hillsâis inherently tranquil and devoid of anything that could be considered revolting, unpleasant, or unsanitary. There are no elements of decay, filth, grotesque imagery, or disturbing figures present. The color palette, composed of earthy greens, browns, muted reds for roofs, and warm off-white tones for the buildings, is harmonious and natural, contributing to a calm and almost rustic atmosphere rather than suggesting anything sickly or visually jarring that might induce revulsion. The brushwork, while visible and contributing to the painting's textural quality, does not convey anything slimy, putrid, or otherwise tactilely disgusting. The composition is balanced and ordered, showing a peaceful coexistence between architecture and nature, far from any chaotic or suffocating arrangements that might trigger an adverse emotional response. In essence, every aspect of this artworkâfrom its subject and color to its texture and compositionâaligns with a sense of quiet beauty and formal exploration, leaving no room for the emotion of disgust to arise."
purim.jpg,Cubism,45.0,"The emotion of disgust in this painting primarily emanates from the unsettling facial expression of the seated older woman on the right. Her features are contorted, with wide, somewhat bulging eyes and a slightly open, downturned mouth, creating a grimace that can be interpreted as a visceral reaction of revulsion or strong aversion. This physical distortion of her face conveys a profound sense of displeasure or recoil, akin to how one might react to something deeply unpleasant or offensive. While her expression could also suggest distress or fear, the specific tightness around her mouth and the strained look in her eyes carry a quality of physical or moral disgust. The raw, somewhat crude style of her depiction further enhances this uncomfortable feeling, making her appearance itself slightly unsettling and capable of evoking a mild sense of revulsion in the viewer. However, there are no other overtly disgusting elements in the painting, such as filth, decay, or gore, which prevents the score from being higher. The feeling of disgust is therefore concentrated almost entirely within the interpretation of this single, prominent facial expression."
return-from-field-work.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting contains absolutely no elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The art style is abstract and cubist-inspired, rendering figures and scenes in a stylized and non-realistic manner. The color palette is vibrant and varied, consisting of pleasant hues that are far from sickly or repulsive. The subjects depicted â including a woman with raised hands, cattle, a figure laughing or singing, and a bird â are presented without any grotesque features, signs of decay, violence, contamination, or moral transgressions. There are no textures or forms that suggest filth, bodily fluids, or anything inherently unpleasant to the senses. The overall impression is one of dynamic composition and colorful visual interest, completely devoid of any stimuli that typically trigger a disgust response."
self-portrait-1913.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This artwork, a fragmented portrait in a Cubist or Futurist style, evokes no discernible feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically elicited by something repulsive, offensive, unhygienic, decaying, or morally reprehensible. The painting depicts a human figure, likely a man, through a deconstructed lens, breaking down the form into geometric shapes and presenting multiple perspectives simultaneously. While this artistic method might challenge conventional notions of representation or even feel jarringly unfamiliar to some viewers, it does not present any content that is inherently vile, grotesque, unsanitary, or morally objectionable. There are no depictions of decay, suffering, explicit violence, bodily fluids, or anything visually or thematically associated with revulsion. The clean lines, deliberate shading, and the intellectual nature of the artistic approach preclude any sensation of disgust."
self-portrait-with-yellow-hat-1965-janos-kmetty-oil-painting-1.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting, a portrait rendered in a somewhat Cubist or Expressionistic style, depicts a man whose features are angular and sharp, suggesting a state of profound thought or inner turmoil rather than repulsion. His hand is raised to his forehead, a gesture commonly associated with deep contemplation, worry, or perhaps a headache. There are no visual cues typically indicative of disgust, such as a wrinkled nose, a grimacing mouth expressing revulsion, or eyes showing aversion. The subject's gaze is somewhat inward or directed away, contributing to the sense of introspection. The muted color palette and the overall somber atmosphere evoke feelings of melancholy, introspection, or burden, but these do not align with the strong emotional reaction of disgust. The structural elements of the face, while distorted, do not convey the specific physiological or psychological signs of aversion or nausea. Therefore, the painting contains virtually no elements that would evoke or represent the emotion of disgust."
self-portrait.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting is highly stylized and abstract, primarily composed of geometric shapes and strong contrasts between dark and light, and warm and cool colors. While the fragmented nature of the face and figure could be interpreted as unsettling or disorienting, there are no elements within the artwork that directly evoke disgust. There is no depiction of gore, decay, filth, bodily fluids, or any subject matter typically associated with revulsion. The angular lines and dark shadows create a sense of drama or intensity, possibly introspection or unease, but not a visceral feeling of repugnance. The use of yellow, black, and touches of red and blue contributes to the overall mood but does not convey anything inherently disgusting. The slight score above zero accounts for a very minor, almost negligible, potential for discomfort stemming from the abstract, somewhat jagged forms, which *might* be subconsciously perceived by some as slightly ""off"" or ""unnatural"" if one were to stretch the definition of what could be mildly disagreeable, but this is far from true disgust."
self-portrait-with-seven-digits-autoportrait-1913.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting ""Self-Portrait with Seven Fingers"" by Marc Chagall evokes very little, if any, sense of disgust. The primary reason for assigning a low score is the absence of visual or thematic elements typically associated with this emotion. Disgust is often triggered by things that are perceived as unclean, contaminated, decaying, grotesque, or morally repulsive. None of these qualities are prominent in Chagall's work here.

While the artist's stylized features, particularly the somewhat angular and mask-like face, and the symbolic ""seven fingers"" on his left hand, deviate from naturalistic representation, they are presented as artistic abstraction and symbolism rather than grotesque deformities intended to evoke revulsion. The seven fingers, in particular, are understood to be symbolic, perhaps referring to the seven days of creation or a Yiddish idiom, rather than a literal physical anomaly designed to be unsettling or sickening. The overall aesthetic is one of dream-like whimsy and introspection, not a representation of something physically or morally repugnant.

The color palette is vibrant and varied, featuring warm yellows, earthy browns, cool blues, and soft reds, all used harmoniously without any sickly or jarring combinations that might induce discomfort. The subjects within the painting â the artist himself, the cityscape of Paris with the Eiffel Tower, the mystical Jewish village scene with a cow and a milkmaid, and the Hebrew script â are all either iconic, pastoral, or culturally significant, none of which are inherently disgusting. There is no depiction of decay, waste, disease, violence, or any unsanitary conditions. The self-portrait focuses on the act of creation, identity, and memory, themes that do not lend themselves to feelings of disgust. The slight score of 5 acknowledges the possibility that some viewers might find the departure from naturalism or the slightly melancholic expression in the artist's eyes to be subtly unsettling in a very minor way, but certainly not to the point of true revulsion or nausea."
rush-hour.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this painting. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues of decay, contamination, bodily fluids, filth, or morally repugnant acts. None of these elements are explicitly depicted in ""New York at Night."" The painting is a fragmented, Cubist/Futurist abstract representation of an urban landscape, focusing on dynamic forms and overlapping planes rather than literal depiction. The color palette consists predominantly of earthy tones, grays, and muted greens, which while not vibrant or ""beautiful"" in a conventional sense, do not inherently suggest putrefaction, illness, or unhygienic conditions that would provoke a visceral sense of disgust. The sharp angles and deconstructed forms create a sense of fragmentation and disarray, which *might*, for a very small segment of viewers, evoke an *extremely faint* and abstract sense of unease akin to encountering something ""broken"" or ""disordered."" However, this is far from the primal, protective revulsion associated with true disgust. The painting lacks any elements that suggest foul odors, contamination, or anything physically repulsive. Therefore, while it might not be universally aesthetically pleasing, it does not possess the characteristics commonly associated with generating a feeling of disgust. The score is very low to reflect this near absence of typical disgust triggers."
shacks-1964.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, characterized by its abstract or semi-abstract representation of what appears to be a village or landscape, uses a palette dominated by blues, purples, grays, and muted greens, along with some earthy tones. The forms are fragmented and geometric, with visible brushstrokes and bold lines. There is absolutely nothing in this artwork that would elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, disease, gore, or morally reprehensible actions. This painting contains none of these elements. The colors, while varied, are not sickly or unappealing in a way that would provoke revulsion. The subject matter, an abstract interpretation of structures and land, is neutral in termsous terms. The artistic style, while abstract, does not convey any sense of physical or moral unpleasantness. Therefore, the painting offers no visual or thematic information that could lead to a sensation of disgust."
small-things-1966.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting, a still life composed of geometric and semi-abstract objects arranged on a flat surface, contains no elements that would evoke disgust. The subject matter is entirely benign, featuring shapes, common play items like dice and a chessboard, and abstract forms. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, waste, or any conventionally repulsive imagery. The color palette is muted and clean, primarily consisting of grays, browns, whites, and dull greens, none of which are inherently sickening or unpleasant. The forms are well-defined and orderly, avoiding any sense of chaos or messiness that might inadvertently trigger a feeling of revulsion. The overall impression is one of intellectual playfulness with shapes and forms, rather than anything visceral or unsanitary. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing within the artwork that elicits a feeling of disgust."
sitting-nude-1909.jpg,Cubism,1.2,"The painting presents a semi-abstract depiction of a nude or partially clothed figure. There are virtually no elements within the artwork that evoke disgust. The color palette consists of muted, earthy tones with some blues and reds, none of which are sickly, jarring, or associated with decay or foulness. The forms are angular and abstracted, typical of certain modernist styles, but they do not portray any grotesque features, deformities, or signs of illness, injury, or bodily fluids that would typically trigger a sensation of revulsion. There is no visible filth, decay, gore, or any subject matter inherently repulsive or unpleasant. While the depiction of a nude body might elicit varying emotional responses depending on individual sensitivities, there is nothing in this artistic rendering that suggests an intention to provoke disgust or that aligns with common visual triggers for this emotion. The overall impression is one of artistic study or introspection, devoid of any offensive or nauseating content."
spanish-dancers.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subjects, two women in what appears to be traditional or formal attire, are depicted with a stylized elegance. There is no visual content that is repulsive, grotesque, dirty, unhygienic, or morally offensive. The color palette is composed of subdued blacks, whites, creams, and earthy tones, none of which are sickly or jarring. The angular, fragmented style, while abstract, does not distort the figures or their environment in a way that would suggest decay, deformity, or anything abhorrent. The expressions on the women's faces are neutral to solemn, not conveying any personal experience of disgust or projecting a repulsive quality. There are no elements of putrefaction, waste, bodily fluids, or anything that would typically trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The overall impression is one of dignified portraiture and artistic formal exploration, entirely devoid of characteristics that induce disgust."
soir-e-d-octobre-1946.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that elicits a sensation of disgust. The artwork is characterized by its abstract composition, utilizing a rich palette of vibrant and harmonious colors, including various shades of yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, and green. The forms are geometric and interlocking, creating a visual rhythm that is engaging rather than repulsive. There are no depictions of anything unclean, decaying, violent, grotesque, or morally offensive. The brushwork and texture appear consistent with oil painting, without any qualities that might be perceived as slimy, sickly, or otherwise physically unpleasant. The overall impression is one of visual complexity and vibrant energy, which stands in direct opposition to feelings of revulsion or aversion typically associated with disgust."
seated-woman-in-garden-1938.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"My assessment for disgust is extremely low because the painting contains almost none of the elements typically associated with evoking this emotion. Disgust is primarily triggered by things that are offensive, repulsive, unclean, grotesque, or that suggest decay, contamination, or violation of bodily integrity in a sickening way.

Looking at this Cubist portrait by Pablo Picasso, the following points underscore the minimal presence of disgust:

1.  **Absence of Traditional Disgust Triggers:** There is no depiction of filth, bodily fluids, gore, disease, decay, or anything overtly violent or decaying. The colors are vibrant and varied, including earthy tones, blues, reds, and yellows, none of which are nauseating or putrid. The forms, while fragmented and geometric, do not suggest organic corruption or physical abjection.
2.  **Artistic Distortion vs. Literal Grotesque:** The figure, likely a woman, is highly abstracted and reassembled from multiple perspectives. While this stylistic choice results in a distorted appearance that deviates significantly from naturalistic representation, it is a deliberate artistic technique (Cubism) rather than a literal depiction of something grotesque or sickening. The fragmentation and angularity are about challenging perception and form, not about presenting something physically repulsive. A viewer might find the distortion unsettling or aesthetically jarring if they are unaccustomed to or strongly prefer realism, but this is an intellectual or aesthetic discomfort, not the visceral, stomach-churning sensation of disgust.
3.  **Lack of Repulsive Subject Matter:** The subject itselfâa seated figureâis innocuous. There are no narrative elements or thematic implications within the painting that would incite moral disgust, such as cruelty, injustice, or moral corruption. The background, with stylized leaves and sky, is benign.
4.  **Aesthetic, Not Abject:** The painting, despite its challenging form, maintains an aesthetic quality. The patterns (stripes, concentric circles) within the fragmented shapes are visually engaging rather than repulsive. The lines are clean, and the composition, though complex, is organized in a way that doesn't feel chaotic or nauseating.

The very slight score of 2.5 is a concession to the extremely remote possibility that someone with an intense aversion to *any* radical departure from traditional realistic human form might experience a fleeting, almost imperceptible sense of recoil or aversion upon seeing such significant distortion. However, this is far from true disgust, which is a powerful, often physical, revulsion. The painting's primary impact is intellectual and perceptual, inviting analysis of form and perspective, rather than triggering an emotional response of disgust."
stables-1913.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting, with its vibrant colors and fragmented, dynamic forms, does not evoke any sense of disgust. There are no visual elements that typically trigger this emotion, such as decay, putrefaction, unhygienic conditions, or grotesque bodily depictions. The subject matter, horses, is generally considered majestic or powerful, not inherently repulsive. While the forms are abstracted, they maintain an energetic and flowing quality rather than appearing disfigured in a way that would be viscerally off-putting. The bright palette of reds, blues, yellows, and greens contributes to a sense of vitality and movement, entirely devoid of the murky, sickly, or unappealing tones often associated with feelings of revulsion. There is no narrative or implied scenario within the artwork that suggests harm, moral transgression, or anything that would provoke an ethical or visceral sense of disgust. The overall impression is one of expressive dynamism and color, offering nothing to recoil from or feel repulsed by."
still-life-on-the-dresser-1955.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes disgust. The artwork is a still life, depicting common household objects such as a vase of flowers, a bowl of fruit, and a pitcher, rendered in a Cubist-influenced style. The colors are warm and earthy, with vibrant accents, and the composition, while fragmented, does not present anything visually offensive or disturbing. There are no elements of decay, contamination, disease, grotesque imagery, or anything that could be interpreted as unhygienic or morally repulsive. The subject matter is benign and the artistic interpretation, even with its abstract qualities, remains aesthetically neutral concerning revulsion. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate."
still-life-1920.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a still life, presents a collection of common food items and household objects: a paper bag, a slice of cake on a stand, several oranges, a stack of cookies, and a plate with neatly coiled orange peels. There is absolutely nothing within this composition that elicits a feeling of disgust. All items appear wholesome and in good condition; there are no signs of decay, spoilage, mold, or contamination on any of the edibles (the cake, oranges, or cookies). The orange peels, although waste products from consumption, are depicted as fresh, clean, and even decoratively arranged, rather than as unpleasant refuse. The setting is orderly and clean, devoid of any mess, dirt, or unhygienic elements that might trigger revulsion. The colors are warm and earthy, and the textures are solid and unthreatening. The overall atmosphere is one of calm domesticity and abundance, completely antithetical to any sensation of repulsion or aversion. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent from this artwork."
still-life-crystal-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The artwork, rendered in a cubist or semi-abstract style with charcoal, does not contain any visual elements typically associated with eliciting disgust. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, decay, filth, violence, grotesque figures, disease, contamination, or any other subject matter that would trigger a sense of revulsion or nausea. The lines are bold and the forms are fragmented and geometric, but this artistic style does not inherently provoke a feeling of disgust. While the abstract nature might be confusing or unsettling to some viewers, these reactions are distinct from disgust. The absence of any discernible repulsive content results in a near-zero score for this emotion. The score is not an absolute 0 to allow for the possibility of an idiosyncratic and highly atypical personal response, but objectively, the image presents nothing to evoke disgust."
still-life-scales-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting is a still life depicting mundane and wholesome objects: a kitchen scale, several loaves of bread, and draped fabric. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that evoke disgust. The bread appears fresh and appetizing, not moldy, stale, or decayed. The scale looks clean and functional. The colors used are natural and earthy, primarily blues, yellows, and grays, none of which are inherently repulsive or sickening. The composition is balanced and typical for a still life, presenting no jarring or unsettling visual information. There are no depictions of filth, decay, violence, bodily fluids, or anything otherwise grotesque or offensive that would trigger a feeling of revulsion. The scene is calm, ordinary, and devoid of any characteristics commonly associated with disgust."
still-life-1.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The emotion of disgust is entirely absent when viewing this painting. Disgust is typically evoked by elements that are offensive, repulsive, decaying, unhygienic, or visually grotesque. This still life, conversely, presents a scene of serene domesticity and gentle aesthetics. There are no depictions of decay, spoilage, or anything unclean within the fruit bowl or the flora. The vessels and their contents are rendered cleanly and harmoniously. The color palette is soft and muted, with no jarring or sickly hues that might induce nausea or discomfort. The composition is orderly and balanced, lacking any chaotic or disturbing elements. The textures appear smooth or subtly rendered, not slimy, sticky, or otherwise viscerally unpleasant. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and visual pleasantness, leaving no conceptual or sensory space for feelings of revulsion or strong aversion."
soccer-field-1934.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The emotion of disgust is virtually absent in response to this painting. The artwork does not present any elements commonly associated with triggering disgust, such as gore, bodily fluids, decay, disease, or grotesque, deformed figures. The color palette is muted and earthy, devoid of any sickening or jarring hues. The figures themselves are highly stylized; even the prominently featured white nude figure is rendered in a classical, idealized manner that emphasizes form and musculature, not vulnerability, impurity, or anything repulsive. The more amorphous figures on the left are abstract forms in motion, lacking any features that would evoke revulsion or a sense of contamination. While the overall mood might be interpreted as somber or mysterious, and the implied action of the figures could suggest struggle or flight, these are distinct emotional registers and do not translate into physical or moral revulsion. There is no visual information to suggest filth, corruption, or any sensory input typically associated with disgust. The textured background, though rough, does not convey anything unsanitary or offensive. Any trace of disgust would be an extremely idiosyncratic and highly subjective response, possibly stemming from a very mild, almost subconscious aversion to abstract, unformed shapes for a highly sensitive individual, but this is far from the primary or even secondary emotional impact of the piece."
still-life-with-ephemeris-1914.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"My emotional response to this painting by Louis Marcoussis registers an extremely low level of disgust, bordering on negligible. There are virtually no elements within the artwork that trigger feelings of revulsion, nausea, or moral outrage commonly associated with disgust. The painting is a Cubist still life, characterized by fragmented forms, multiple perspectives, and a muted color palette of grays, blacks, whites, browns, and subtle touches of blue and reddish-orange. None of these colors are inherently sickening or convey a sense of decay or putrefaction. The subject matterâidentifiable elements like a newspaper clipping (dated ""1914 MAR 2""), a book spine (""EAU DAN...""), and various bottles or glassesâare mundane objects that do not carry any inherent connotations of filth, contamination, or unhygienic conditions. The fragmented and geometric style of Cubism, while perhaps intellectually challenging or disorienting to some, is a formal artistic approach that typically distances the viewer from direct visceral reactions like disgust. There is no depiction of decay, waste, bodily fluids, gore, or any subject matter that would activate the brain's natural aversion responses. The textures are painted, not tactile in a way that would suggest unpleasantness. In essence, the painting presents an analytical and deconstructed view of everyday objects, focusing on form and space rather than any content that could be deemed repulsive or offensive."
still-life-red-and-yellow.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The visual elements presentâabstract shapes, bold color blocks, and simplified formsâdo not align with common triggers for this emotion. There is no depiction of decay, rot, bodily fluids, contamination, or anything grotesque or explicitly repulsive. The colors are vibrant and clean, rather than sickly or muddy. The organic shapes, such as the green and yellow forms, could even be interpreted as fruits or pleasant natural objects. While the large brown, amorphous shape is abstract, it does not suggest anything inherently disgusting. The overall composition is clean and defined, lacking any visual cues that would typically elicit a visceral reaction of revulsion or unease associated with disgust. A score of 1 is assigned, indicating an almost complete absence of this emotion, allowing only for the most remote and individualistic abstract interpretation that might, for a tiny fraction of viewers, associate an amorphous shape with something vaguely unappealing, though not truly disgusting."
still-life.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this still life painting that evokes a feeling of disgust. The subject matter consists of potted plants, cut flowers in a vase, and fruits, all common and generally pleasant objects. The artistic style, characterized by geometric fragmentation and bold, often vibrant colors, is an aesthetic interpretation rather than a realistic depiction, but it does not introduce any elements that would trigger revulsion. There are no signs of decay, rot, spoilage, or any unsanitary conditions. The shapes, while abstract, are clean and defined, and the colors are fresh and lively, particularly the greens of the foliage and the yellow and orange hues of the fruits and some flowers. There are no disturbing textures, grotesque forms, or unpleasant themes. The painting presents a clean, stylized, and visually engaging composition, entirely devoid of any visual cues typically associated with disgust."
stll-life-with-a-red-vase-1939.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting, a still life featuring a pitcher, grapes, and other fruits in a bowl, along with a large white fluffy object (possibly a flower or plume), evokes no discernible sense of disgust. The subjects depicted are common, benign objects typically associated with nourishment, nature, and domesticity, none of which inherently trigger a repulsive reaction. The fruits appear ripe and fresh, not decaying or unappetizing. The pitcher is solid and functional in appearance. The white fluffy element, whether floral or textile, is depicted with a soft, inviting texture rather than anything slimy, prickly, or unsanitary. The colors, while somewhat stylized and bold, are not sickly or jarring in a way that would induce nausea or revulsion. The overall composition is balanced and harmonious. There are no disturbing elements, unsanitary conditions, or distorted forms that would lead to a visceral feeling of disgust. The painting presents a clean, orderly, and rather aesthetically pleasing arrangement of objects."
still-life-with-lemons-1907.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke a sense of disgust. The artwork is a still life, depicting common, everyday objects: a bottle or jar, a bowl, and a lemon. These items are presented cleanly and without any signs of decay, rot, grime, or unhygienic conditions that would typically trigger revulsion. The colors, while strong and contrasting (vibrant blues, greens, yellows, and reds), are not sickly, putrid, or suggestive of organic decomposition. The brushwork is visible and expressive, contributing to the painting's texture and energy, but it does not mimic anything slimy, viscous, or otherwise unpleasant to the touch or sight. The forms are simplified and somewhat abstracted, yet they do not distort the objects into grotesque or repulsive shapes. There is no narrative content or implied context that hints at anything morally repugnant, violent, or physically offensive. The overall impression is one of a vibrant and composed study of form and color, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would lead to a feeling of disgust."
still-life-with-water-jug-towel-and-jars-1929.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this still life painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts a collection of inanimate objectsâvarious vessels and draped fabricârendered in a Cubist or geometric style. There is no imagery suggestive of decay, bodily fluids, contamination, filth, or anything unhygienic or morally offensive. The colors, while muted and featuring strong contrasts between light and shadow, are not jarring or unappealing in a manner that would trigger revulsion. The forms are clean and defined, and the overall impression is one of quiet contemplation rather than anything repulsive or off-putting. The subject matter itself, common household items, is inherently neutral and lacks any content typically associated with the emotion of disgust."
sudak-the-valley-1917.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The artwork depicts a vibrant landscape featuring trees, large reddish-brown mountains or rock formations, and a small building nestled amongst the greenery. The colors usedâblues for the sky, various greens for the foliage and foreground, and warm reddish-browns for the mountainsâare natural and pleasant. There are no elements within the subject matter that are decaying, grotesque, violent, unhygienic, or otherwise inherently repulsive. The brushstrokes are expressive and painterly, contributing to the scene's dynamic quality rather than creating any sense of unpleasantness or aversion. The overall impression is one of a stylized, energetic natural scene, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger a feeling of disgust."
taureau-ix-1954.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. The artwork features a vibrant and fragmented composition, typical of an abstract or cubist style, presenting a stylized figure amidst geometric shapes and bold colors. There are no elements within the painting that are conventionally associated with disgust, such as grotesque or decaying imagery, representations of bodily fluids, or themes that are morally or ethically repugnant. While the figure is distorted and fragmented, this is a characteristic of the artistic style and does not convey any visceral unpleasantness or revulsion. The color palette is rich and varied, and the forms, though abstract, do not suggest anything repulsive or offensive. Therefore, based on the visual content and aesthetic presentation, there is no basis to associate this artwork with the emotion of disgust."
taureau-x-1955.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, an abstract or surreal composition, does not contain any elements typically associated with eliciting disgust. There are no depictions of gore, decay, filth, contamination, or anything that suggests disease or putrefaction. The forms are stylized and geometric, and while they might represent figures or objects, they are rendered in a clean, non-repulsive manner. The color palette, though varied, does not utilize sickly or unsettling hues that might evoke a sense of nausea or revulsion. Even abstract shapes, such as the red forms in the lower half or the 'caterpillar' at the very top, are presented without any context that would imbue them with disgusting qualities. The artwork appears to be an aesthetic exploration of form and color rather than an attempt to provoke a visceral negative reaction like disgust."
t13861-10.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that elicits a sensation of disgust. The artwork presents a clean, abstract, and highly structured architectural composition. The dominant cool blues and grays, complemented by muted yellows and greens, create a serene and somewhat intellectual atmosphere, rather than anything repulsive. The lines are precise and geometric, depicting a complex but orderly structure, possibly a greenhouse or an intricate building interior. There are no elements suggestive of decay, filth, organic matter, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or anything that might be perceived as unhygienic or morally offensive. The texture appears smooth and controlled, and the overall impression is one of visual clarity and abstract order, which stands in direct opposition to any visual cues that typically trigger feelings of revulsion or disgust."
the-artists-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"The painting, an abstract composition, contains absolutely no elements that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is often triggered by visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or things that are inherently repulsive or unhygienic. This artwork, however, is characterized by vibrant, contrasting colors (bold blues, yellows, oranges, and reds) and dynamic, flowing, and angular abstract shapes. There are no discernible figures, objects, or textures that could be interpreted as vile, offensive, sickening, or otherwise disgusting. The clean, energetic lines and bright palette contribute to an impression of dynamism and perhaps even joy or confusion, but not revulsion. Therefore, the visual information presented by the artwork simply does not align with any stimuli known to provoke disgust."
the-appointment-of-the-four-forms-from-the-portfolio-life-forms.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The artwork, being an abstract composition rendered in black and white with varying textures and shading, presents very few elements that could elicit a sense of disgust. There is no depiction of decay, disease, bodily fluids, gore, or anything explicitly unhygienic or putrid. The forms, while organic and somewhat biomorphic in nature, do not suggest anything repulsive or offensive. The cross-hatching and stippling techniques used to create texture and depth are executed cleanly and systematically, not in a way that implies grime, slime, or messiness. The solid black areas are simply voids or strong contrasts, devoid of any inherent disgusting quality. The overall impression is one of visual exploration of shape, volume, and texture rather than a portrayal of anything that would trigger a visceral feeling of revulsion or nausea. The very low score reflects the near absence of any visual cues typically associated with the emotion of disgust."
the-bird-seller-1976.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"My assessment for disgust is very low, bordering on negligible. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are perceived as unhygienic, decaying, contaminated, or morally repugnant in a viscerally sickening way. The painting, titled ""Bird Vendor,"" features a person carrying multiple birdcages with birds inside, rendered in a vibrant, geometric style. There are no visual cues that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or physical aversion. The birds, while confined, are depicted in a stylized manner, appearing healthy and colorful, not sickly, decaying, or distressed in a way that would induce disgust. The cages themselves are clean and geometrically rendered, lacking any indication of squalor or filth. Furthermore, the act of a bird vendor, while some might find the concept of caging birds saddening or ethically debatable, does not inherently evoke a feeling of disgust in the visceral sense, unlike images of cruelty, decay, or extreme unhygienic conditions. The clean lines, bright colors, and dynamic composition work against any feeling of unpleasantness or revulsion. The score of 2 acknowledges the extremely rare and subjective possibility that the concept of animal confinement, in itself, could trigger a minor, almost metaphorical sense of ""disgust"" for a very small segment of viewers, but it is not a direct or intended emotional response to the visual elements presented."
the-cloud-1921.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits or suggests the emotion of disgust. The artwork is a still life rendered in a Cubist style, depicting common objects such as a guitar, a newspaper, and a window. The forms are geometric and fragmented, and the color palette consists of browns, golds, blues, and whites, which are generally harmonious and not jarring or sickly. There are no depictions of decay, filth, grotesque imagery, or anything that would be considered physically repulsive. Furthermore, the subject matter lacks any narrative or thematic elements that could be interpreted as morally offensive or deeply unpleasant. The overall impression is one of analytical composition and artistic exploration, not one designed to provoke revulsion or strong aversion. Therefore, the feeling of disgust is entirely absent in response to this particular work."
the-bird-cage.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, a Cubist work by Pablo Picasso, is characterized by its abstract, fragmented forms and vibrant, contrasting colors. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by stimuli that are perceived as repulsive, offensive, or contaminative, often relating to decay, disease, waste, or morally repugnant acts. None of these elements are present in this artwork.

The geometric fragmentation and multiple perspectives, while challenging to traditional interpretation, do not evoke a sense of revulsion or nausea. The colors (bold reds, blues, yellows, oranges, greens) are dynamic and engaging rather than sickly or putrid. There are no discernible subjects that depict gore, filth, bodily fluids, or any form of decay. While the abstraction might be disorienting or unfamiliar to some viewers, this typically leads to feelings of confusion, intellectual curiosity, or perhaps mild frustration, not disgust. The visual language is one of artistic exploration and formal composition, not the representation of anything inherently offensive or distasteful. The score is minimally above zero to account for the extremely remote and idiosyncratic possibility of someone finding abstract forms or jarring color combinations mildly unsettling in a way that could hypothetically, for a fraction of a second, touch upon discomfort, but it is unequivocally not a painting designed to, nor does it effectively, elicit disgust in any significant measure."
the-blue-cloth-1925.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, a Cubist still life, offers almost no elements that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is primarily triggered by things perceived as contaminated, decaying, unhygienic, or morally repellent. This artwork depicts common, inanimate objects such as a basket of bread or fruit, a bottle, a glass with grapes, a musical instrument, and sheet music. All of these items are benign and inherently non-disgusting. The Cubist style, while fragmenting and reassembling forms, does so in an intellectual and aesthetic manner, not in a way that suggests decay, illness, or repulsive textures. The colors are muted and earthy, devoid of anything jarring or sickly that might hint at an unpleasant condition. There are no visible signs of spoilage on the food items (grapes, bread), nor any bodily fluids, waste, or grotesque imagery. The overall composition is balanced and focused on the artistic exploration of form and perspective rather than on evoking a visceral emotional response of aversion. Any minuscule level of disgust would be highly idiosyncratic and not a common or intended reaction to the subject matter or artistic style."
the-circus-1918.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The artwork features a highly fragmented, geometric composition with vibrant, clean colors and abstract forms. Disgust is typically triggered by elements associated with decay, filth, bodily effluvia, or a violation of visual or moral integrity that is perceived as repulsive. None of these triggers are present here. The stylized, deconstructed figures and objects, while abstract, are rendered with sharp lines and distinct color blocks, giving them a clean and almost mechanical appearance rather than anything organic that could be decaying or offensive. There is no depiction of grime, rot, illness, or grotesque deformation that would cause revulsion. The overall impression is one of dynamic movement and artistic experimentation, not a subject or aesthetic that is physically or morally offensive in a way that would elicit disgust. The very low score reflects the near-complete absence of any visual cues that could reasonably lead to this emotional response."
the-creation-of-the-prehistoric-world-state-1923.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of disgust. The depicted creature, though fantastical and abstract, does not possess any visual qualities typically associated with this emotion, such as decay, filth, disease, gore, or grotesque bodily functions. Its highly stylized form, clean lines, and geometric patterns contribute to an artistic representation rather than a realistic one that might trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The colors are earthy and the overall aesthetic is one of symbolic or mythological representation, entirely devoid of elements that would be perceived as offensive, repulsive, or unhygienic."
the-breakfast-1921.jpg,Cubism,5.5,"The painting, with its highly stylized and simplified forms, does not overtly present any visual elements typically associated with disgust. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque deformity in a repulsive sense, or morally repugnant subject matter. The figures are rendered with smooth, almost mechanical precision, which while de-individualizing and perhaps unsettling to some, does not evoke revulsion. The clean lines, bold shapes, and stark palette contribute to a sense of monumentality and order rather than anything that would trigger physical or aesthetic disgust. The low score reflects the near absence of any features that would elicit a feeling of strong aversion or revulsion. A very slight, almost negligible score is given for the potential ""uncanny valley"" effect some viewers might experience from the extreme dehumanization and generalized, mask-like faces, which could be perceived as unnaturally smooth or cold, but this is a very minor interpretation and does not strongly align with the core feeling of disgust."
the-feast-of-the-tabernacles-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"This painting, ""The Feast of the Tabernacles"" by Marc Chagall, evokes a sense of solemnity, tradition, and perhaps a touch of mystical or folktale charm, but it contains virtually no elements that would trigger a feeling of disgust. The color palette is vibrant and expressive, dominated by rich blues, greens, and yellows, which are not inherently repulsive. The figures, while rendered in Chagall's characteristic distorted and simplified style, are not grotesque, decaying, or engaged in any activities that suggest squalor, unhygienic conditions, or moral depravity. The scene depicts a religious celebration, a time of gathering and observance, which is generally associated with reverence and communal spirit rather than revulsion. There are no depictions of gore, bodily fluids, vermin, decay, extreme physical disfigurement, or morally reprehensible acts. Even the chicken in the foreground, though an animal, is depicted benignly and does not suggest any unpleasantness. The overall clean, albeit stylized, appearance of the sukkah and its inhabitants, combined with the celebratory context, actively works against any feeling of disgust. The score is not an absolute zero only because art, being subjective, *could* theoretically induce an idiosyncratic minor aversion in someone, but there is nothing inherent in the work to universally or commonly provoke this emotion."
the-javelin-thrower.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this artwork that evokes a sense of disgust. The image is a stylized, Art Deco-era representation of the Olympic Games, celebrating athleticism and the human form in motion, albeit in a geometric and somewhat robotic manner. The colors are earthy and muted, but not in a way that suggests decay or unpleasantness. There are no grotesque figures, no depictions of filth, contamination, or decay. The subject matter itself (sports) is generally positive and inspiring, and the artistic style, while unique, does not venture into any territory that would trigger revulsion or nausea. The overall impression is one of strength, movement, and graphic design, entirely devoid of any elements that could be associated with disgust."
the-fourteenth-of-july-1914.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, rendered in a modernist style with simplified forms and a vibrant, albeit somewhat muted, color palette, offers no discernible elements that would typically evoke disgust. There is no depiction of decay, disease, waste, violence, or any morally repugnant subject matter. The figures are abstracted and blocky, but not grotesque or distorted in a way that triggers revulsion. The colors are generally pleasant and harmonious, avoiding sickly or muddy tones often associated with feelings of disgust. While the abstract nature might be unsettling for some viewers seeking realism, it does not translate into a feeling of disgust. The overall impression is one of artistic interpretation and composition, rather than anything inherently repulsive or offensive to the senses or moral sensibilities. The extremely low score reflects the near-complete absence of any visual cues or thematic content that could reasonably lead to a sensation of disgust. A minimal score above zero is given only to acknowledge the highly subjective nature of emotional responses and the remote possibility that a viewer might find the abstract simplification of human forms to be mildly disconcerting or ""off-putting"" in a way that *very vaguely* brushes against a sense of unease, though this is far from true disgust."
the-jug-on-the-table.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a Cubist still life, presents familiar objects such as a pitcher, cups, and saucers in a fragmented and reassembled manner. There is absolutely nothing in the subject matter, color palette, or artistic style that elicits feelings of disgust. The objects are depicted cleanly, albeit abstractly, and do not convey any sense of decay, filth, contamination, or anything typically associated with revulsion. The colors are muted and cool, lacking any tones that might suggest illness or putrefaction. The fragmentation, characteristic of Cubism, is an intellectual and visual exercise, not a portrayal of something repulsive. There are no disturbing or unpleasant elements, nor is there any narrative suggestion that would provoke such an emotion."
the-fiddler-1914.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting ""The Violinist"" by Marc Chagall evokes a range of emotions, but disgust is notably absent from them. There are no visual elements within the artwork that suggest filth, decay, contagion, grotesque deformation, or anything inherently repulsive to the senses. The figures, while stylized and non-naturalistic in proportion and color (such as the green beard of the violinist or the pale, somewhat abstracted faces), do not present as diseased, injured, or otherwise physically off-putting in a way that would trigger a visceral response of revulsion. The setting, a fantastical village scene with a house and a large, golden crescent shape, is depicted with a dreamlike quality rather than any harsh or unpleasant reality. The subject matter itself â a musician and other village inhabitants â carries no inherent association with disgust. The overall aesthetic is one of poetic surrealism, folk memory, and emotional expression, none of which lean towards prompting a feeling of revulsion or moral outrage that typically underpins disgust. Any score above zero would be due to an extremely minute, almost imperceptible, or highly subjective reading of an unconventional color or shape, but objectively, the artwork contains no content designed or likely to elicit disgust."
the-fiance-1944.jpg,Cubism,5.0,"The painting, rendered in a Cubist or Expressionist style, features highly abstracted and distorted human figures. While these distortions â such as the asymmetrical faces, elongated limbs, and fragmented forms â might evoke a sense of unease or the uncanny in some viewers due to their departure from naturalistic representation, they do not present elements typically associated with disgust. Disgust is generally triggered by things that are repulsive, sickening, rotten, unclean, or morally offensive. This artwork lacks any visual cues such as decay, bodily fluids, extreme grotesque mutilation (beyond stylistic abstraction), filth, or disturbing subject matter that would elicit a strong visceral reaction of revulsion. The colors are muted and earthy, not sickly or garish. The subject of two figures, one seemingly holding a musical instrument, is neutral. Any minor 'disgust' registered would likely be an idiosyncratic response to the unfamiliar or 'unnatural' depiction of the human form, rather than an intentional or commonly provoked feeling of revulsion or sickness from the artwork itself. Therefore, the score is very low, acknowledging a potential, but very mild and uncommon, discomfort from extreme distortion, rather than true disgust."
the-level-crossing-1912.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The artwork, characterized by its Cubist fragmentation and abstract forms, presents no discernible elements that would typically evoke a sensation of disgust. There is an absence of imagery commonly associated with revulsion, such as decay, bodily fluids, filth, violence, or any representation of something putrid or morally reprehensible. The color palette, composed of various greens, earthy yellows and browns, vibrant reds, and soft creams, does not employ sickly or unappetizing hues. While the fractured planes and intersecting lines create a sense of visual complexity and perhaps disorientation for some viewers, this aesthetic challenge does not translate into a feeling of contamination or visceral aversion. The painting's subject, whatever its underlying reality, is rendered in a manner that detaches it from any physical or conceptual source of disgust."
the-lamp-1919.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke feelings of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are perceived as contaminated, decaying, grotesque, vile, or unsanitary, such as bodily fluids, waste, rot, or severe mutilation. The figure, while stylized and appearing to be a segmented mannequin or doll, does not display any characteristics that fall into these categories. Its construction, with visible joints and a featureless face, is consistent with its inanimate nature rather than suggesting decay or injury to a living being. The color palette, though dark, does not depict filth or putrefaction. The overall scene is static and somewhat somber, but entirely devoid of any visual cues that would lead to a sensation of revulsion or strong aversion."
the-sailor-self-portrait-1912.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting does not evoke any discernable sense of disgust. The stylized depiction of the sailor, with his vibrant orange skin and angular features, is an artistic choice that might be unconventional but does not present anything grotesque, repulsive, or inherently unpleasant. There are no elements of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or distorted features designed to provoke revulsion. The background figures are abstract and shadowy, but their ambiguity does not lean towards anything disgusting. The color palette, while bold, does not suggest disease or decay. Overall, the artwork seems to focus on formal experimentation and character representation rather than attempting to elicit a negative visceral reaction like disgust."
the-night-responds-to-my-complaints-1933.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The color palette, predominantly muted browns, greys, and earthy tones with subtle hints of blue and red, is harmonious and does not contain any sickly, putrid, or offensive hues. The forms, though fragmented and abstract, are stylized and geometric, not grotesque, decaying, or visually repulsive. There is no depiction of filth, decay, bodily fluids, gore, or any subject matter typically associated with physical revulsion. Furthermore, there are no implied narratives or thematic elements (such as moral corruption or betrayal) that would trigger a sense of moral disgust. The overall atmosphere, while perhaps melancholic or dreamlike, is aesthetically neutral in terms of evoking any negative sensory or moral repugnance. The artwork is devoid of any visual or conceptual cues that would align with this emotion."
the-new-eve-1924.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork features stylized, geometric figures that resemble mannequins or robots, set within an abstract, city-like environment. There is an absence of any visual cues commonly associated with disgust, such as bodily fluids, decay, filth, disease, gore, or grotesque distortions that might trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The scene is clean, orderly, and somewhat sterile, with muted colors and sharp lines. There is no depiction of harm, violence, cruelty, or any narrative suggesting moral depravity that could lead to a sense of moral disgust. While the figures might be perceived as impersonal or uncanny by some viewers, these sensations do not align with the specific emotion of disgust, which is typically a response to something perceived as contaminated, offensive, or viscerally repulsive. The painting presents a detached and conceptual aesthetic, leaving no room for a feeling of revulsion or abhorrence."
the-signal-1915.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting primarily conveys emotions of chaos, energy, and perhaps tension or conflict through its vibrant red hues, dynamic brushwork, and distorted figures. However, there are very few, if any, elements within the composition that directly evoke the emotion of disgust. There are no depictions of decay, bodily fluids, unsanitary conditions, disfigurement, or anything putrid or vile that typically trigger a visceral feeling of revulsion. The forms, though abstract and intense, do not suggest sickness, rot, or physical repulsion. While the dark, shadowy areas and the menacing red eyes in the far right might evoke unease or fear, they do not inherently lead to a feeling of disgust. The overall atmosphere is one of dramatic action rather than nauseating repulsion. Therefore, the presence of disgust in this artwork is virtually negligible."
the-sand-crab.jpg,Cubism,5.2,"The artwork, characterized by its angular, fragmented forms and Cubist/Expressionistic aesthetic, evokes a sense of visual chaos and distortion rather than the specific emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, disease, or morally repugnant acts, none of which are explicitly depicted here. While elements like the jagged, tooth-like shapes at the top or the wide, distorted eyes might contribute to a feeling of unease, apprehension, or even mild repulsion in some viewers, these sensations do not equate to the visceral revulsion associated with disgust. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, gore, unhygienic conditions, or anything conventionally considered repulsive in a physical sense. The ""grotesqueness"" present is more a matter of stylistic distortion and formal experimentation, which might be unsettling or challenging to interpret, but does not inherently trigger an instinctual desire to recoil due to perceived contamination or vileness. The overall impression is one of fragmented forms and perhaps a deconstructed figure, which is more intellectually perplexing than viscerally disgusting."
the-viaduct.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The artwork is characterized by bold, clean lines, vibrant and distinct colors (primarily yellow, red, and blue with white and black accents), and abstract, geometric forms that suggest industrial or architectural structures, along with a stylized figure. There is absolutely nothing in the visual content that is repulsive, sickening, or offensive in a way that would trigger disgust. The colors are bright and clean, not muddy or decaying. The shapes are orderly and abstract, lacking any grotesque distortions, depictions of filth, decay, gore, or anything traditionally associated with physical or moral revulsion. The overall impression is one of modern artistic energy and structural form, entirely devoid of any quality that could be interpreted as disgusting."
the-studio-ix-1954.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The primary colors are muted and dark (blacks, browns, greys) with accents of yellow, white, and a pale peach/pink. While the dark palette contributes to a somber or contemplative mood, it does not suggest filth, decay, or anything physically repulsive. There are no explicit depictions of bodily fluids, waste, rot, violence, or contamination, which are common triggers for disgust. The forms are fragmented and abstract, characteristic of Cubism, suggesting objects like a musical instrument (guitar-like shape) and a large goblet. These objects, even in their fractured state, do not carry any inherent qualities that would elicit revulsion. The texture implied by the brushstrokes is painterly and somewhat rough, but not slimy, sticky, or otherwise viscerally unpleasant. The overall composition might be perceived as complex or even chaotic due to its fragmentation, which could lead to a feeling of intellectual confusion or mild unease, but not the strong physical or moral aversion associated with disgust. There is nothing in the visual language, subject matter, or implied narrative that would provoke a feeling of revulsion or nausea in an observer."
the-trapeze-artists-1922.jpg,Cubism,2.0,"The painting, with its dynamic composition, vibrant colors, and stylized figures, does not evoke any significant sense of disgust. The subject matter appears to be figures in motion, possibly performing or dancing, surrounded by umbrella-like forms. There are no elements within the artwork that trigger typical disgust responses such as depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or grotesque and repulsive forms. The human figures, while abstract and simplified, are not rendered in a way that suggests deformity or sickness designed to cause revulsion. The expressive brushwork and bold outlines contribute to a sense of energy rather than an unsettling or nauseating atmosphere. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is nearly absent, as the painting contains no visual cues that would typically provoke such an aversion."
the-violin-1916.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting, ""The Violin and the Piano"" by Raoul Dufy, evokes a sense of vibrant energy and artistic expression, rather than any feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by imagery that is revolting, unclean, grotesque, or morally offensive. This artwork contains none of these elements. The subject matterâmusical instrumentsâis inherently associated with beauty, harmony, and creative endeavor. The colors are bright and lively (reds, oranges, blues, yellows), creating a dynamic and stimulating visual experience that is far from unpleasant or repulsive. The forms, though abstracted in a Cubist-influenced style, are clearly recognizable and do not convey any sense of distortion or decay. There are no disturbing textures, grotesque figures, or scenes of filth, decay, or violence. The overall impression is one of musicality and artistic vitality, leaving absolutely no room for any sensation of revulsion or aesthetic displeasure that would constitute disgust. A score of 0.5 is assigned to reflect the absolute minimal, almost imperceptible possibility that someone might find the particular combination of colors or abstraction slightly jarring on a purely personal, idiosyncratic level, but it is not a widely or intentionally evoked emotion by the artwork itself."
the-wash-stand-1942.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This still life painting, featuring a pitcher, a bowl with what appears to be fruit or bread, and a spoon on a table, elicits no discernible feeling of disgust. The depicted objects are common, everyday items typically associated with nourishment and domesticity, not with anything repulsive or unhygienic. The colors, while bold and somewhat abstract, are primarily warm and earthy tones (reds, yellows, browns, greens) that are visually stable and do not suggest putrefaction, illness, or contamination. There are no elements of decay, filth, grotesque imagery, bodily fluids, or anything visually offensive that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. The painting's style and subject matter maintain a clean and orderly presentation, completely devoid of any cues that might provoke nausea or an adverse reaction based on disgust."
the-studio-viii-1954.jpg,Cubism,15.0,"The painting, while visually complex and fragmented, generally does not aim to evoke a strong sense of disgust. There are no direct depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything traditionally associated with a visceral reaction of revulsion. The vibrant color palette and abstract forms tend to create an energetic, albeit chaotic, atmosphere rather than a repulsive one.

However, a mild degree of disgust might be experienced by some viewers due to the grotesque, mouth-like form located at the very bottom of the composition. This element features jagged, white, tooth-like shapes and a pinkish-purple blob that could be interpreted as a tongue or inner mouth. Its distorted, predatory, and somewhat monstrous appearance can elicit a faint feeling of aesthetic disgust or repulsion, as it presents an unsettling and unnatural visual. This is a subtle and subjective reaction, stemming from the 'unpleasant' or 'disturbing' nature of this specific abstract form, rather than from any explicit representation of contamination or decay. The overall abstraction and lack of realistic detail mitigate any strong visceral response, keeping the sensation of disgust very low."
the-three-graces.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting, depicting three nude female figures in what appears to be an artist's studio, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements such as decay, filth, gore, disease, moral revulsion, or extreme unpleasantness. None of these elements are present in this artwork. The figures are rendered with simplified forms and bold outlines, typical of a modernist or folk-art style, rather than with hyper-realistic detail that might expose flaws intended to repulse. While the bodies are not idealized and possess a certain robust, even slightly ""pudgy"" quality, this is a stylistic choice and not depicted in a manner intended to be grotesque or unwholesome. Their expressions are neutral or slightly contemplative/posed, not conveying any emotion that would induce revulsion in the viewer. The overall color palette is bright and the setting mundane (an artist's studio with a landscape visible through a window, and an easel), offering no imagery or atmosphere that would trigger a visceral sense of repugnance. The depiction of nudity in this context, akin to traditional life drawing, does not inherently cause disgust for the general audience. A score of 1 acknowledges the infinitesimally small chance of an idiosyncratic, highly personal, and extremely atypical reaction of mild discomfort that *might* be misconstrued as a whisper of disgust by an observer with exceptionally low tolerance for the human form or a particular aesthetic, but emphasizes that the painting itself contains no intrinsic qualities designed or likely to elicit this emotion."
three-figures.jpg,Cubism,1.5,"The artwork presents two stylized, abstract figures rendered with bold black outlines and areas of flat, somewhat muted color. The forms are angular and geometric, lacking any organic or realistic detail that might evoke a physical sensation of repulsion. There are no depictions of decay, filth, gore, bodily excretions, or anything typically associated with a visceral sense of revulsion. The color palette, consisting of blues, greens, yellow, and a muted pinkish-red against a grey background, is not inherently offensive or sickening. While the abstract nature might be perceived as unsettling or unfamiliar by some, it does not translate into disgust. The composition and subject matter provide no narrative cues or symbolic elements that would suggest anything morally objectionable or physically noxious. Therefore, there is virtually no basis within the visual elements of this artwork to elicit a feeling of disgust."
the-mutilated-1943.jpg,Cubism,4.5,"The emotion of disgust is very minimally evoked by this painting. There are no explicit depictions of gore, bodily fluids, decay, or anything conventionally repulsive. The subject matter itself â two figures, seemingly in conversation or interaction, both utilizing crutches â does not inherently provoke disgust. However, if one were to stretch the interpretation, a very slight and indirect sense of aesthetic discomfort might arise from certain visual elements. The figures are rendered with a highly textured, almost distressed surface, resembling aged wood grain or mottled plaster. While primarily a stylistic choice that adds depth and character, this visual texture, when applied to human forms, could, for a sensitive viewer, subtly hint at a state of being ""worn down,"" rough, or perhaps slightly ""unhealthy"" or ""unclean"" in a very abstract sense, rather than smooth or pristine. The presence of crutches further emphasizes a condition of physical fragility or impairment. This is a highly tenuous connection to disgust, more akin to a slight aesthetic aversion to roughness or perceived decay than true revulsion. The painting's primary emotional landscape leans towards contemplation or perhaps melancholy, not stomach-churning disgust. Therefore, the score is very low, acknowledging only the most remote and subjective possibility of such a feeling."
three-girls-on-red-background-composition-with-three-women-1927.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this painting through the lens of disgust, I find no elements that would evoke this emotion. Disgust typically arises from encountering something perceived as vile, offensive, repulsive, or morally reprehensible. The painting depicts three highly stylized, almost robotic human figures against a vibrant red background. Their forms are geometric and simplified, rendered in monochromatic tones of white, grey, and black. While the aesthetic is unconventional and departs from realistic representation, it does not present anything physically grotesque, decayed, or unsanitary. There are no depictions of gore, filth, bodily fluids, or anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. Furthermore, the subject matter itselfâa group of figures, one holding a flowerâis benign and carries no inherent moral or ethical transgressions that would lead to moral disgust. The figures, despite their impersonal and block-like appearance, do not convey any intent or state that is repugnant. The choice of stylization is a formal artistic decision, not an attempt to create something repulsive or sickening. Therefore, based on the visual information and common triggers for disgust, this artwork registers a complete absence of this particular emotional response."
trees-by-the-water-1900.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, a watercolor landscape by Paul CÃ©zanne, evokes feelings of serenity and tranquility rather than disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, offensive, unhygienic, or visually jarring in a negative way (e.g., decay, gore, bodily fluids, or deeply unsettling subject matter). This artwork features a natural scene with trees and water, rendered in soft, harmonious washes of green, blue, yellow, and earthy tones. The light, airy quality of the watercolor medium and the loose, impressionistic brushwork contribute to a calm and almost ethereal atmosphere. There are no discernible elements within the composition, color palette, or subject matter that could be interpreted as disgusting or revulsive. The scene is pleasant, natural, and aesthetically pleasing, entirely lacking any visual cues that would elicit an emotional response of disgust."
three-women-1908.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by imagery associated with decay, filth, disease, bodily fluids, gore, or things perceived as morally repugnant or contaminated. This artwork, characteristic of early Cubism, features figures rendered in warm, earthy tones (predominantly oranges and reds) against a green background. While the figures are highly stylized and fragmented, typical of the artistic movement, their forms are not grotesque, decaying, or overtly disfigured in a way that would cause revulsion. There is no depiction of violence, suffering, unhygienic conditions, or anything putrid or foul. The color palette is vibrant and earthy, rather than sickly or unappetizing. The subject matter appears to be a study of the human form and its geometric representation, devoid of any content that would elicit a visceral negative reaction of disgust."
two-men-with-cockerel.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subject matter, which includes two stylized human figures, a cat, a rooster, and a still life, contains no elements typically associated with disgust such as decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or anything visually repulsive. The cubist-inspired artistic style, while abstracting and fragmenting the forms, does not render them in a grotesque or sickening manner. The color palette is composed of earthy tones, blues, and whites, which are generally pleasant and not unsettling. The overall composition is balanced and orderly. There are no implied narratives of squalor, moral corruption, or physical suffering that might indirectly trigger a feeling of revulsion. The aesthetic is clean, contemplative, and geometrically structured, entirely absent of any qualities that would provoke an emotional response of disgust."
three-nudes-in-the-forest.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is nothing within this artwork that elicits a feeling of disgust. The image is a stylized, multi-colored woodcut or print featuring several human-like figures, primarily two prominent yellow nude figures in the foreground and more shadowy grey figures in the background, set against a dark backdrop with green, organic shapes and red vertical elements. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are perceived as offensive, repulsive, or morally repugnant, often related to decay, bodily fluids, filth, violence, or extreme deformity. None of these elements are present here. The figures, though simplified and somewhat abstract in form, are not grotesque, decaying, or depicted in a state of distress or injury that would provoke revulsion. The nudity is presented in an artistic, non-explicit manner, common in fine art, and therefore does not inherently trigger moral disgust. The color palette, while bold and somewhat earthy, is not sickly or unpleasant. The textures are not offensive, and the overall composition does not convey a sense of squalor, disease, or any subject matter typically associated with disgust. The scene appears more contemplative, allegorical, or dreamlike rather than something inherently repulsive."
tracking-down-guiltless-doves.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"The painting evokes an almost complete absence of disgust. There are no elements within the artwork that typically trigger this emotion. The abstract forms, while energetic and somewhat biomorphic, are not grotesque, disturbing, or reminiscent of anything repulsive. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, disease, or any other subject matter commonly associated with disgust. The color paletteâvibrant reds, yellows, greens, and black set against a stark white backgroundâis lively and clean, bearing no association with sickness or contamination. While the paint is applied thickly (impasto), creating a noticeable texture, this texture reads as artistic expression and material presence rather than anything tactilely unpleasant like slime, stickiness, or grit that might provoke revulsion. The overall impression of the painting is one of abstract dynamism and a playful or perhaps chaotic energy, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would lead to feelings of revulsion or nausea. The score of 0.1 acknowledges the infinitesimal possibility of a highly idiosyncratic and subjective aversion to abstract shapes or thick texture for an individual, but fundamentally asserts the near-total absence of disgust as a primary emotional response."
two-women-with-the-toilet-final-state-1920.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork utilizes a clean, geometric, and abstracted style, with clear lines and a palette of solid, un-muddy colors (blacks, whites, grays, and bold primary accents like yellow and blue). Disgust is typically associated with repulsive sensory input, such as decay, filth, bodily fluids, or morally reprehensible subjects. This painting, however, presents a structured, almost architectural composition of forms that appear mechanical and orderly rather than organic or decaying. There is nothing visually offensive, grotesque, or unsanitary depicted. The fragmentation is a stylistic choice (Cubism/Purism) and does not suggest a violation or defilement of a subject that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. The overall aesthetic is one of clarity, construction, and formal exploration, completely devoid of any imagery or thematic elements that could be perceived as disgusting."
title-unknown-coty-1917.jpg,Cubism,10.0,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this painting. Disgust is typically a strong visceral reaction to something perceived as repulsive, unclean, putrid, or a threat of contamination. This artwork, while highly fragmented and abstract, does not present any elements that directly trigger such a response. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or grotesque deformities in a manner that would induce revulsion.

The painting features disjointed human figures, partial nudes, and mechanical elements, rendered in a Cubist/Dadaist/Surrealist style. While the fragmentation of the human form and its integration with machinery might be perceived as unsettling, unnatural, or even a form of dehumanization, this tends to provoke intellectual discomfort, bewilderment, or a sense of alienation rather than a visceral feeling of disgust. The figures are stylized and clean in their execution, devoid of any qualities that suggest unhygienic conditions or physical repulsiveness. For instance, the fragmented bird/chicken and the partial human forms are presented as compositional elements rather than as objects of revulsion. Therefore, any very mild sense of aversion might stem from the deliberate deconstruction and unusual juxtaposition of familiar forms, which some viewers might find subtly ""wrong"" or disharmonious, but this is far from a strong feeling of disgust."
uknown.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, with its distinct Constructivist or Suprematist style, utilizes highly geometric and stylized figures. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that evoke a sense of disgust. The figures, rendered in bold colors and sharp lines, are abstract representations rather than realistic portrayals, thus preventing any visceral reaction that might arise from seeing decay, gore, bodily fluids, or anything physically repulsive. The subject matter appears to be stylized performers or dancers, which is not inherently offensive or disturbing. There are no grotesque features, distorted expressions, or scenes of moral depravity depicted. The clean composition and aesthetic presentation do not trigger any feelings of revulsion, sickness, or discomfort typically associated with disgust."
varanasi-iii-1973.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of disgust evoked by this painting, I find virtually no elements present that would elicit such a response. The artwork consists of minimalist line drawings on a dark background, depicting figures in what appears to be a natural setting, possibly bathing or performing a ritualistic cleanse at sunrise. The subjectsâhuman figures, water, sun, and simple vesselsâare rendered with elegant simplicity and do not portray anything inherently repulsive, unclean, or morally objectionable. There is no gore, decay, squalor, or any visual cues typically associated with feelings of revulsion or sickness. The lines are clean and fluid, suggesting movement and perhaps purification, which are antithetical to disgust. The partially nude figure is depicted with a lack of overt sensationalism, appearing natural within the context of being in water. The overall aesthetic leans towards a meditative or serene quality, rather than anything jarring or offensive. A score of 0.5 is assigned to reflect the absolute minimum, acknowledging the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association, but practically, the painting offers no content that triggers disgust in an objective art appraisal."
view-of-notre-dame-1914.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"My emotional response regarding disgust to this painting is extremely low, warranting a score of 1. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are offensive, repulsive, decaying, unhygienic, or morally repugnant. This painting, characterized by its dominant cool blue hues and abstract forms, presents none of these qualities. There is no representation of organic decay, bodily fluids, filth, or any subject matter that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The brushwork, while visible and somewhat raw, does not create an unpleasant or sickening texture. The shapes, particularly the architectural-like forms at the top and the lines and green shape below, are abstract and ambiguous, but not in a way that suggests anything grotesque or unsanitary. The green element, rather than appearing sickly, is a vibrant, almost fresh green. The overall ambiance is one of contemplation or perhaps melancholy, rather than anything repulsive. The very slight score of 1 accounts for the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly individual interpretation, but objectively, there is nothing within the visual elements of this artwork that aligns with the common triggers for disgust."
untitled-1.jpg!PinterestLarge.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this painting solely for the emotion of disgust, I find no elements within the artwork that elicit such a response. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, contamination, bodily fluids, grotesque deformity, or moral depravity. This painting, an abstract composition, presents none of these characteristics. Its grayscale palette lacks the sickly hues often linked to putrefaction or unhealthiness. The forms, while dynamic and fragmented, are geometric and curvilinear, not organic in a way that suggests rot or decomposition. There are no identifiable figures, objects, or scenes that could be interpreted as repulsive or nauseating. The lines are clean, and the shading creates a sense of depth and structure, rather than implying grime or decay. The work appears to be an exploration of form, movement, and light/shadow, intellectual in its approach, rather than visceral or designed to provoke revulsion. Therefore, based on established artistic triggers for disgust, this painting registers no discernible presence of that emotion."
untitled-3.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is nothing within this abstract and stylized painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The colors used are bold and clean (blues, reds, greys, and a warm yellow background), not sickly, muddy, or indicative of decay. The forms are geometric and angular, characteristic of Cubist influence, which inherently distances the viewer from visceral reactions commonly associated with disgust. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, waste, decomposition, unsanitary conditions, or any grotesque elements. The figures, while depicted in poses that might suggest interaction, drama, or supplication, do not convey any sense of revulsion or repulsion. The scene does not imply any moral transgression or physical threat that would trigger a feeling of disgust. The overall impression is one of artistic interpretation of human figures and a setting, rather than anything offensive to the senses or morality."
trouville-1911.jpg,Cubism,2.5,"The painting, ""Les Joueurs de Cartes"" by Fernand LÃ©ger, depicts figures fragmented and reassembled into geometric, machine-like forms, characteristic of Cubism. While the style is highly unconventional and departs significantly from traditional realistic representation of the human form, there are very few elements within the artwork that directly evoke the emotion of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual cues suggesting decay, filth, bodily fluids, moral repugnance, or the grotesque. None of these are explicitly present here. The palette consists of muted grays, blacks, browns, with industrial blues and greens, and some warm yellows, none of which are used in a way that suggests putrefaction or unpleasant substances. The subject matter itself â soldiers playing cards â is a mundane activity and does not inherently suggest anything offensive or revolting.

The extremely low score reflects the near-absence of any visual or thematic cues traditionally associated with disgust. However, a minute non-zero score is given to acknowledge a very abstract and indirect interpretation. For some viewers, the extreme dehumanization and mechanization of the human figures, stripping them of organic warmth and individual expression, might evoke a faint, intellectual sense of discomfort or aversion to the representation of humanity as cold, hard, and fragmented. This aversion, if intense enough, could theoretically brush against a conceptual form of disgust for the loss of the familiar human form. Yet, this is a highly subjective and peripheral reaction, far from the primary emotional response the artwork is likely to elicit, which is more often related to intellectual engagement with form and modernity rather than visceral revulsion."
wild-garden-1959.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"This painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. The artwork presents a complex tapestry of organic and geometric forms, rendered with a rich and varied color palette. While the imagery is abstract and perhaps somewhat chaotic in its composition, there are no elements that suggest decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or any subject matter typically associated with feelings of revulsion or aversion. The textures, though detailed, do not appear slimy, sticky, or otherwise unappealing to the touch or sight. The plant-like motifs and patterns are stylized and decorative rather than indicative of putrefaction or disease. There is nothing visually offensive, sickening, or morally reprehensible depicted that would trigger a visceral response of disgust. The overall impression is one of intricate natural patterns and an imaginative landscape, devoid of any qualities that would lead to a feeling of disgust."
view-towards-the-danube-1933.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"The painting, depicting a vibrant village scene by a river, contains absolutely no elements that could evoke disgust. There are no grotesque or distorted figures, no imagery of decay, disease, bodily fluids, or waste. The colors, though bold and non-naturalistic (such as the bright yellow house and strong reds), are expressive rather than repulsive or nauseating. The simplified forms and elevated perspective do not convey any sense of squalor, filth, or moral corruption. The subject matter itselfâa peaceful landscape with housesâis inherently neutral, if not pleasant. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things that are physically or morally repulsive, and none of these characteristics are present in this artwork."
woman-and-bird-1930.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that elicit a feeling of disgust. The painting employs a strong, geometric, and somewhat Cubist-inspired style, utilizing bold, clean colors like red, blue, green, and yellow against a warm, neutral background. The subject, a stylized figure that appears to be a woman with a bird, is rendered abstractly but without any grotesque, decaying, unhygienic, or morally repugnant imagery. The lines are sharp and defined, the colors are vibrant rather than sickly or muddy, and the overall composition, while fragmented, does not present anything viscerally offensive or revolting. There is no depiction of physical decay, bodily fluids, gore, filth, or any subject matter that would typically trigger an aversion response. The artistic choices lean towards aesthetic exploration and expression, not towards provoking revulsion."
vytautas-kairiukstis-kubistinis-portretas-imagelarge.jpg,Cubism,1.0,"The painting, an abstract or Cubist-inspired portrait, presents a composition of geometric shapes and planes rendered in a palette of mostly soft, muted colors including blues, grays, light pinks, creamy yellows, and browns, with a small vibrant touch of orange/red. There is absolutely nothing within this artwork that could reasonably elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by stimuli associated with decay, filth, disease, bodily fluids, offensive odors, or morally repugnant acts. None of these elements are present or even subtly hinted at in this painting. The forms are clean and abstract, devoid of any organic textures that might suggest decay or sliminess. The colors, while varied, are harmonious and not jarring or sickly in a way that would provoke revulsion. The subject matter, a fragmented and reassembled head, is stylized and intellectual rather than visceral or grotesque. There are no disturbing narratives, unsettling details, or visual cues that would trigger a visceral sense of unpleasantness or revulsion. The overall aesthetic is one of formal exploration and visual harmony, standing in stark contrast to anything that might induce disgust."
woman-on-a-balcony-1914.jpg,Cubism,0.1,"The painting, with its vibrant colors, strong geometric forms, and stylized depiction of a woman and a village, contains no elements that would reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust. There are no representations of decay, filth, bodily functions, putrefaction, or any visually repulsive subject matter typically associated with this emotion. The colors are bold and clean, the lines are sharp, and the overall composition is structured and aesthetically pleasing. The subject of a person contemplating a landscape, along with a small vase of flowers, is benign and even serene, offering no sensory or thematic cues that would trigger revulsion or nausea. The artistic style itself, characterized by abstraction and vivid hues, lends itself more to intellectual engagement or aesthetic appreciation rather than visceral, negative reactions like disgust."
woman-with-mandolin-1925.jpg,Cubism,0.5,"The painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. There is nothing depicted that is repulsive, grotesque, offensive, or decaying. The figure is portrayed in a simplified, somewhat stylized manner, and while the nudity is present, it is rendered artistically and not in a way that aims to be vulgar or disturbing. The colors are bright and distinct, and the overall composition appears serene and contemplative rather than unsettling or nauseating. There are no elements that would trigger a visceral feeling of revulsion or distaste. The very low score acknowledges the remote possibility that an individual might have an idiosyncratic, extremely sensitive reaction to any form of artistic nudity or simplified facial features, but for the vast majority, there is no discernible element designed or likely to provoke disgust."
workbox.jpg,Cubism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes a feeling of disgust. The artwork is a Cubist still life featuring common, everyday objects such as sewing tools (scissors, thread, thimble, lace), a keyhole, a ruler, and what appears to be a wallet. All these items are depicted in a clean, fragmented, and somewhat abstract manner, typical of the Cubist style. There are no elements of decay, filth, grime, bodily fluids, violence, or any other subject matter typically associated with triggering a disgust response. The colors are earthy and muted, and the composition, while fractured, does not present anything repulsive or offensive. The painting is an intellectual exercise in form and perspective, rather than an attempt to provoke a visceral emotional reaction like disgust."
zinc-1917.jpg,Cubism,80.5,"The painting evokes a significant degree of disgust, primarily stemming from its unsettling imagery, potential sacrilege, and crude, almost visceral aesthetic.

Firstly, the central red figure itself contributes to this emotion. Its stark, raw, and almost flayed-like depiction of human skin, combined with the dark, simplified facial features, creates a grotesque and unsettling presence. It's not merely stylized; it appears deliberately disfigured or rendered in a way that evokes bodily unease. The crude rendering lacks refinement, leaning into a primitive, almost repulsive quality.

Secondly, and perhaps most potently, is the strong implication of sacrilege and vulgarity. The figureâs outstretched arms clearly reference the iconography of a crucifixion, yet it is stripped of traditional reverence. Below its waist, a distinctly yellow, banana-like or phallic object is prominently displayed and seemingly attached. This crude, suggestive, and arguably obscene addition, juxtaposed with such a sacred pose, creates a profound sense of offense and moral revulsion. The word ""ZINC"" boldly displayed above the figure further compounds this feeling, transforming what might be a spiritual symbol into a commercial commodity or an object of industrial degradation, cheapening and desacralizing it in a manner that can be deeply disgusting to many viewers. This deliberate degradation of a revered image through vulgarity and commercialization is a powerful trigger for disgust.

Lastly, the tactile quality of the painting itself, with its rough, heavily textured, and almost lumpy application of paint, particularly on the dark green background, contributes to the sense of revulsion. It lacks smoothness or elegance, instead presenting a raw, unrefined surface that visually and haptically suggests something unpleasant, perhaps even decaying or diseased, amplifying the overall sense of unease and visceral repulsion."
