a-time-to-turn-48x48.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting is an abstract composition dominated by sweeping, layered forms and a muted color palette of whites, greys, browns, and subtle hints of purples and oranges. There are no discernible figures, objects, or explicit subject matter that could trigger a feeling of revulsion or strong disapproval. The brushstrokes convey a sense of movement and light, with forms appearing to overlap and recede, creating a dynamic yet ethereal quality. Nothing in the colors, textures, or implied shapes suggests decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesqueness, or any other visual cue typically associated with disgust. The overall aesthetic is rather clean, airy, and non-representational, focusing on the interplay of light and shadow and abstract forms. The very minimal score acknowledges that individual subjective responses can vary, but objectively, there is virtually nothing within this artwork's visual language that aligns with common triggers for disgust."
abstraccion-no-3-1953.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric and organic shapes connected by sweeping black lines, presents no visual elements typically associated with eliciting disgust. There is no representation of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or anything that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. The color palette, composed of muted earth tones, pastels, and cooler blues and greens, is generally harmonious and does not feature jarring or sickly combinations that might induce discomfort. The forms are clean and defined, lacking any chaotic or disturbing textures or shapes that could be interpreted as repulsive. As an abstract work, it does not convey a narrative or subject matter that could be morally or ethically offensive, which are other common triggers for disgust. The overall aesthetic is one of deliberate design and visual exploration, rather than anything inherently unpleasant or contaminated. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is virtually absent when viewing this artwork."
abstract.jpg,abstract,1.0,"This abstract painting presents virtually no elements that would typically elicit a feeling of disgust. The dominant palette of reds, pinks, and dark purplish-blacks, while intense, does not conjure images of decay, filth, or anything viscerally repellent. There are no grotesque forms, disturbing textures, or recognizable subject matter that could be perceived as offensive or repulsive. The visible brushstrokes create a sense of texture and depth, but these are painterly and expressive rather than suggestive of anything slimy, putrid, or unhygienic. Disgust is often triggered by things that are perceived as contaminated, nauseating, or morally repugnant; this painting, with its focus on color interaction and abstract composition, offers no such visual cues. The overall impression is one of artistic exploration of color and form, far removed from anything that would provoke revulsion."
abstract-1940.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are foul, repulsive, unhygienic, decaying, or morally offensive. This abstract artwork, composed of clean geometric shapes, bold colors (deep blue, rich red, bright orange, warm brown, and soft pink/peach), and orderly patterns, presents nothing that could be interpreted as such. The textures, while visible as crayon or pastel strokes, are not unsettling or tactilely repulsive. The composition is structured and the subject matter is non-representational, avoiding any depiction of unpleasant objects, substances, or scenarios. The colors are vibrant and well-defined, rather than muddy or sickly. Overall, the artwork is aesthetically ordered and visually stimulating in a neutral to positive way, entirely devoid of characteristics that would provoke aversion or repulsion."
abstraction-1927-1.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting does not evoke any sensation of disgust. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or anything inherently repulsive or nauseating. The abstract forms, colors, and textures are benign and do not trigger a visceral reaction of aversion. While parts of the surrounding frame appear worn or distressed, this is a common aesthetic choice in art presentation and does not translate into a feeling of disgust for the artwork itself. The spray paint technique and the organic shapes are aesthetically neutral or even pleasant, certainly not disgusting."
2005-60-80.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting is an abstract composition of colors and lines, and it contains no elements that typically evoke the emotion of disgust. There is no representational imagery of decay, bodily fluids, filth, disease, or any subject matter that would be considered physically repulsive. The colors (red, blue, green, and off-white/yellow) are vibrant and contrasting, but not inherently disgusting. The bold black lines create a sense of movement and structure, but they do not suggest anything vile or offensive. While there are visible brushstrokes and some paint drips, these are stylistic elements common in abstract expressionism and do not imply unsanitary conditions or revolting substances. The overall impression is one of energetic abstraction, rather than anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea."
abstraction-white.jpg,abstract,0.1,"The painting presents a serene and abstract composition dominated by cool tones of white, various shades of blue, and deep grays or black in the central crevice. The visual elements—smooth, flowing lines, soft gradients, and an ethereal quality—do not contain any characteristics typically associated with disgust. There is no representation of decay, filth, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, gore, or anything conventionally unpleasant or offensive. The dark crevice, while suggesting depth or a void, evokes mystery or perhaps vastness rather than revulsion. The overall aesthetic is clean, calming, and almost spiritual or naturalistic (like clouds, ice formations, or abstract geological features). As such, the painting completely lacks the visual triggers that would induce a feeling of disgust."
against-the-light-1986.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting presents no visual elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The color palette, featuring warm golds, yellows, and browns transitioning to darker tones, is generally appealing and lacks any sickly, putrid, or unsettling hues commonly associated with revulsion. The geometric shapes (squares and circles) and faint diagonal lines are orderly and abstract, not organic, decaying, or chaotic in a manner that might suggest contamination or unpleasantness. There is no depiction of grime, decay, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or any other subject matter typically known to trigger disgust. The overall impression is one of visual pattern and a gradient shift, which can be perceived as aesthetic or intriguing, but certainly not offensive or repulsive to the senses."
african-1958.jpg,abstract,5.5,"The painting, with its fragmented, mosaic-like background and superimposed dark, amorphous shapes, offers very little to evoke a sense of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily fluids, disease, or morally repugnant acts. None of these elements are explicitly or implicitly present. While some of the dark shapes in the upper portion might be vaguely interpreted as stylized animal heads with open mouths, possibly suggesting aggression or predatory intent, this does not inherently translate to disgust. They are abstract enough and lack specific details (like gore, saliva, or signs of illness) that would trigger such a visceral reaction. The color palette, composed of various earthy tones, blues, oranges, and grays, is neither repulsive nor indicative of decay. The overall aesthetic leans towards abstract or semi-abstract forms, which generally distances the viewer from the direct sensory triggers of disgust. There is no suggestion of uncleanliness, bodily functions, or any element that would make one feel revulsion or nausea. The minor score is merely a reflection that *any* image could theoretically evoke a minimal, idiosyncratic negative feeling in someone, but there's nothing inherent in the artwork's composition, subject matter, or execution that aims to elicit or successfully elicits disgust in a general sense."
after-the-floods-1936(1).jpg,abstract,1.0,"The painting, with its abstract forms, muted earthy colors, and scribbled, hieroglyphic-like lines, offers almost no visual cues that would trigger a feeling of disgust. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, or any grotesque subject matter. The aesthetic is more suggestive of ancient symbols, primitive art, or a playful exploration of form and color, none of which inherently provoke revulsion. The textures, while visible, do not suggest anything physically repulsive or unclean. The overall impression is one of contemplative abstraction rather than visceral unpleasantness. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is practically absent when viewing this artwork."
abstraction-1926.jpg,abstract,15.0,"The painting primarily evokes a sense of vibrant abstraction and organic flow, which generally does not lean towards disgust. However, certain elements could, for a very small minority of viewers or under a specific interpretive lens, trigger a mild, fleeting sense of revulsion. The speckled, slightly grainy texture of the dark background, particularly with its coppery-brown flecks, could be subtly associated with grime, rust, or an unclean, aged surface. Furthermore, the abstract, amoebic shapes, particularly those with less defined edges or darker, more opaque centers, might vaguely resemble microscopic organisms, cellular decay, or biological processes that are not inherently pleasant. The use of muddy yellows and oranges alongside blacks in some areas could, in an abstract way, be interpreted as resembling unpleasant organic matter or substances like bile. While there is no explicit or strong imagery typically associated with disgust (such as gore, waste, or overt decay), these subtle textural and amorphous suggestions could contribute to a very low-level, almost unconscious, sense of things being slightly unhygienic or ambiguously organic in a way that lacks appeal, rather than being overtly repulsive. The overall dynamic and colorful nature of the artwork largely counteracts any significant feeling of disgust, making its presence extremely minor and highly subjective."
abstraction-with-reference-to-a-flowering-tree-1925.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this piece, ""Ancient Sound"" by Paul Klee, specifically for the emotion of disgust, I find absolutely no elements within the artwork that would elicit such a response. Disgust is typically evoked by something that is repulsive, sickening, or offensive, often associated with decay, filth, or unpleasant sensory experiences. This painting, however, is an abstract composition of colored squares and rectangles, arranged in a grid-like structure. There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as vile or repulsive. The color palette, ranging from vibrant blues, greens, yellows, and pinks in the central cluster to more subdued and earthy tones in the surrounding areas and darker background, is aesthetically harmonious and visually engaging, rather than jarring or sickening. The composition, while not perfectly geometric, possesses a quiet order and rhythm, devoid of any chaotic or unsettling qualities that might lead to visual revulsion. The texture of the paint appears consistent with typical artistic materials and does not suggest anything tactilely unpleasant or decaying. The overall impression is one of contemplative beauty, exploration of color and form, and a meditative visual experience, none of which align with the psychological or physiological triggers for disgust. Therefore, on a scale of 0 to 100, the presence of disgust is definitively 0."
altar-painting-1915.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork is characterized by its precise geometric forms, orderly composition, and a harmonious, albeit muted, color palette. The imagery of a radiant golden sun and a structured pyramid with ascending color progressions and symbolic elements conveys concepts of order, spirituality, and intellectual ascent. There are no depictions of decay, contamination, bodily fluids, gore, filth, or anything conventionally considered repulsive or abhorrent. The clean lines, abstract nature, and symbolic content are far removed from any visual cues that would trigger a visceral or moral response of revulsion. The painting evokes contemplation and perhaps a sense of cosmic or spiritual structure, entirely devoid of elements that would provoke disgust."
application-1962.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract collage, composed of various shapes of torn and cut paper, presents no visual elements that could reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual stimuli associated with decay, filth, bodily functions, or disturbing and grotesque imagery. The artwork features a clean, graphic aesthetic with a diverse palette of colors (reds, oranges, greens, blues, browns, yellows, pinks, purples) and irregular yet distinct shapes. The torn edges, while providing texture, do not convey any sense of unpleasantness or decay; rather, they are a characteristic of the collage medium, suggesting a handcrafted quality. There is no representation of anything offensive, unhygienic, or morally repulsive. The composition is balanced and visually engaging, appealing to aesthetic interest rather than eliciting a visceral negative reaction. Therefore, there is absolutely no basis for a feeling of disgust in response to this piece."
animal-head-1938.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The artwork evokes an extremely low level of disgust. There are no explicit visual cues typically associated with this emotion, such as decay, bodily fluids, gore, or the grotesque. While the abstract, organic forms and the somewhat murky green color could, in rare individual interpretations, be vaguely associated with something vaguely biological or cellular that might be found unpleasant, they do not inherently depict anything rotten, diseased, or inherently repulsive. The thick impasto texture does not suggest anything slimy or inherently disgusting, but rather a tactile, painterly quality. The swirling, blob-like shapes, while not immediately identifiable, lack any inherent qualities that would trigger a visceral response of revulsion or nausea."
black-and-violet-1923.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, an abstract work by Wassily Kandinsky, presents a composition of geometric shapes, lines, and a diverse palette of colors against a warm, earthy background. There is absolutely nothing within the visual elements or implied subject matter that would evoke a sensation of disgust. The colors, including vibrant reds, oranges, greens, blues, and purples, along with neutrals like black and white, are arranged harmoniously and do not carry connotations of decay, putrefaction, sickness, or anything typically associated with a repulsive aesthetic. The shapes are clean, precise geometric forms (circles, triangles, squares, and various lines), devoid of any organic, grotesque, or chaotic textures that might trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, waste, contamination, or any imagery that would trigger the innate human response to avoid or recoil from something perceived as offensive or unsanitary. The overall impression is one of visual energy, balance, and intellectual engagement, entirely removed from any triggers for disgust."
bandeirinhas-e-mastro.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The image presents a vibrant, patterned composition featuring numerous flag-like shapes in various colors such as red, purple, blue, pink, and dark brown/black, arranged in rows and columns. A prominent, jagged red line cuts diagonally through the center. From a purely visual standpoint, there are virtually no elements within this artwork that would typically elicit a feeling of disgust. The colors are generally bright and varied, not sickly, decaying, or indicative of rot or filth. The shapes are abstract and reminiscent of festive banners, lacking any grotesque, deformed, or repulsive characteristics. The overall aesthetic appears to be that of a hand-drawn or crayon-like texture, which lends an innocent or artistic quality, rather than one that suggests unsanitary conditions or unpleasant tactile sensations. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, waste, disease, decay, or anything that violates common aesthetic or social norms in a way that would trigger revulsion. The jagged red line, while a disruption in the pattern, is abstract and does not represent gore, a wound, or anything inherently vile. The image's content and style are entirely devoid of the visual cues typically associated with disgust, leading to an extremely low, almost negligible, score for this emotion. The score of 0.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly abstract personal association, rather than any intrinsic quality of the artwork."
catedral-1973.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork is an abstract geometric composition characterized by a palette of cool blues, greens, and hints of soft pinks and whites. The shapes are clean-lined triangles and rectangles arranged in a patterned, almost tessellated manner, creating a sense of order and visual rhythm. There are no organic forms, textures, colors, or subject matter that could be perceived as repulsive, decaying, filthy, grotesque, or otherwise offensive to the senses. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by stimuli associated with contamination, moral offensiveness, decay, or things that are physically or viscerally unpleasant. This painting presents none of these qualities; instead, it offers a visually harmonious and abstract experience that is neutral to calming, thereby evoking absolutely no sense of revulsion or disgust."
color-perspective-1922.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork presented is an abstract composition primarily featuring geometric shapes and a balanced color palette. It consists of various overlapping forms in shades of light grey, dark grey, light mint green, and vibrant lime green, set against a peachy-orange background. The textures appear to be painterly and clean, without any visual cues suggesting grime, decay, disease, or any other sensory quality typically associated with disgust. There are no recognizable figures, objects, or scenarios that could be interpreted as repulsive, grotesque, or morally offensive. The lines are generally crisp, and the arrangement of shapes, while dynamic, does not evoke a sense of disarray or chaos that might be unsettling. The colors are generally pleasant and harmonious, avoiding any sickly or jarring combinations. Therefore, based purely on the visual information provided, there are absolutely no elements within this abstract painting that would trigger or align with the emotion of disgust."
blue-view-from-the-window-1959.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that trigger a physiological or psychological response associated with this emotion. The color palette, dominated by vibrant blue and cheerful yellow/gold, is clean and bright, completely devoid of hues typically linked to decay, disease, or unpleasantness. The forms depicted are abstract or highly stylized, suggesting perhaps a whimsical landscape, architectural structures, or a still life with flowers/butterflies. None of these shapes or figures are grotesque, deformed, or indicative of contamination, waste, or bodily effluvia. The brushwork is visible but not messy in a repulsive way; rather, it contributes to a lively, painterly feel. There is no narrative content that suggests violence, cruelty, or any morally repugnant acts that could induce a form of moral disgust. The overall impression is one of a decorative, almost playful abstraction, completely antithetical to feelings of revulsion or nausea."
armonie-di-forme-contrarie-1935.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this painting for the emotion of disgust, I find there are no elements present that would evoke such a response. Disgust is typically triggered by imagery associated with decay, filth, disease, gore, or morally repugnant subject matter. This painting, an abstract work, features a dynamic composition of geometric and organic forms in shades of pink, red, brown, and grey. The textures, while granular in some areas, do not mimic anything putrid or repulsive. The colors are warm and energetic, not sickly or unsettling. There is no narrative or representational content that suggests anything unpleasant, offensive, or physically revulsive. The overall impression is one of movement, light, and abstract form, completely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger a sensation of disgust."
capricious-1930.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There are no visual elements within this abstract painting that evoke the emotion of disgust. The artwork primarily consists of geometric and organic shapes, lines, and a palette of muted browns, yellows, black, and pink, with accents of green and white. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, contamination, bodily fluids, disease, squalor, or actions considered morally repulsive. This painting contains none of these. The forms, while abstract, do not suggest grotesque or repulsive figures, textures (such as sliminess or stickiness), or unsanitary conditions. The colors are not reminiscent of decomposition or unpleasant substances. The overall composition is dynamic and balanced, inviting contemplation of form and color rather than eliciting a visceral reaction of aversion or revulsion. Therefore, there is no discernible basis for a feeling of disgust in response to this artwork."
composition-1922-4.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting, an abstract composition, offers very little to evoke a sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues related to decay, contamination, grotesque imagery, or things that are inherently repulsive, often on a visceral level. This artwork, however, presents vibrant, dynamic forms and a rich color palette (blues, reds, yellows, greens, oranges) that are far from indicative of anything nauseating or unhygienic. The abstract nature means there are no discernible figures or objects that could be interpreted as gruesome or sickening. While the dark, intersecting lines might create a sense of tension or fragmentation, they do not depict anything literally repulsive. There are no muddy, sickly colors, nor are there textures or forms that suggest decay, filth, or biological repulsion. The overall impression is one of energetic visual exploration rather than anything that would prompt an instinct to recoil or feel revulsion."
composition-1919.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting presents no discernible visual elements or thematic content that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork is characterized by a vibrant and diverse palette of colors, including blues, yellows, reds, greens, browns, and muted tones, arranged in dynamic, fluid, and angular shapes. There is no depiction of anything traditionally associated with revulsion, such as decay, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, unsanitary conditions, or morally reprehensible acts. The forms are abstract and stylized, and while a central element might be interpreted as a highly stylized eye or mouth, it does not possess any disturbing or repulsive qualities. The overall aesthetic is one of color exploration and formal composition, neither of which inherently triggers a visceral response of disgust. The colors are generally appealing and clean, and the composition, while energetic, does not contain any jarring or unsettling elements that might induce a sensation of nausea or aversion. Therefore, there is a complete absence of any visual cues that would lead to a feeling of disgust."
central-1986.jpg,abstract,68.3,"The primary colors of deep red and black, dominating the composition, immediately evoke associations with blood, raw flesh, and decay. The textures are mottled, irregular, and highly organic, resembling visceral matter rather than something artificial or inanimate. The central circular form, with its dark, irregular interior, can be interpreted as an unnervingly exposed orifice, a festering wound, or a microscopic view of diseased cells. This evokes a sense of biological raw material that is not clean or healthy, stirring an instinctive aversion. The surrounding wavy lines and uneven blotches further contribute to this feeling, appearing like congealed blood, distorted veins, or decaying tissue. The overall impression is one of rawness and potential morbidity, causing a visceral reaction of mild to moderate revulsion. While abstract, the suggestive qualities of the colors and textures powerfully hint at something organic in a state that one might naturally find repulsive or unappetizing."
composition-1965.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The color palette is soft and muted, primarily consisting of gentle yellows, beiges, and light blues, which are inherently calming and pleasant. The forms are abstract and ethereal, resembling washes of color or very faint, almost ghostly outlines, which are non-threatening and non-repulsive. There are no harsh lines, disturbing subjects, grotesque figures, or any elements that could be perceived as dirty, decaying, morbid, or aesthetically offensive. The overall impression is one of tranquility and subtlety, far removed from anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or distaste."
composition-1924-1.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork is an abstract composition primarily featuring cool tones of green, blue, and purple, accented by touches of pink. The shapes are a combination of angular and curved forms, arranged in a balanced and visually coherent manner. There are absolutely no elements within the painting that could be associated with conventional triggers for disgust. The colors are clean and harmonious, rather than sickly or putrid. The forms are non-representational and do not suggest anything decaying, unclean, vile, or morally offensive. There is no depiction of bodily fluids, waste, disease, injury, or any subject matter that typically elicits revulsion. The texture appears to be that of a painted surface, which is neutral. The overall aesthetic is one of formal exploration and color interaction, entirely devoid of any sensory or conceptual cues that would prompt a feeling of abhorrence or nausea. Therefore, the painting elicits no discernible emotional response related to disgust."
composition-1936.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting presents a vibrant and organized composition of geometric and curvilinear shapes in a wide array of colors including various shades of green, blue, yellow, red, grey, and black. Disgust, as an emotional response, is typically triggered by stimuli that are perceived as repulsive, foul, sickening, or morally offensive. There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that align with these triggers. The colors are clean and bright, not muddy or suggestive of decay or illness. The forms are abstract and orderly, devoid of any organic, visceral, or disturbing imagery. There is no narrative content or symbolic representation that could evoke moral revulsion. The painting's aesthetic is purely visual and non-representational, focusing on color, shape, and composition, none of which present characteristics that would incite a feeling of disgust."
composition-1933.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The artwork is an abstract composition featuring a variety of textures, shapes, and a muted, earthy color palette. There are no recognizable figures, objects, or scenarios typically associated with feelings of disgust, such as decay, bodily fluids, gore, or filth. The colors, which include shades of red-orange, yellow, brown, and hints of blue and teal, are generally pleasant or neutral and do not evoke sensations of rot, sickness, or putrefaction. The textures appear gritty or coarse, resembling aged paper or a specific art medium, rather than anything unsanitary or repulsive. While the dark, spiky, star-like form in the center-left might be perceived as slightly sharp or unsettling by some, it does not convey revulsion or strong aversion. The overall aesthetic is one of abstract exploration of form and texture, providing almost no visual cues that would trigger a visceral or psychological feeling of disgust. The score is exceedingly low, reflecting the near-complete absence of any elements capable of eliciting this particular emotion."
composition-1992.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting does not evoke a significant sense of disgust. The artwork is abstract, composed of various stylized shapes, patterns, and a vibrant, yet at times dark, color palette. There are no visual elements commonly associated with triggers for disgust, such as decay, bodily fluids, gore, filth, disease, or anything that suggests contamination or rot. The forms, while sometimes organic and irregular, do not depict anything grotesque or inherently repulsive. For instance, the speckled textures do not appear as mold or disease but rather as decorative patterns, and the ""scaly"" purple section is a textural detail, not suggestive of something repulsive. The bold color choices and busy composition might be overwhelming or chaotic for some viewers, potentially leading to a very mild, almost negligible feeling of aversion or discomfort, but this falls far short of a true sensation of disgust, which typically involves a strong aversion response to something perceived as offensive or contaminated. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust to this particular painting is extremely minimal."
composition-1998.jpg,abstract,2.0,"My assessment of disgust for this painting is exceptionally low because there are virtually no elements within the artwork that inherently evoke a feeling of revulsion or strong aversion. The color palette, while rich and varied with deep browns, purples, and accents of yellow and red, is not grotesque or unsettling. The forms are abstract and organic, suggesting shapes like leaves, berries, vessels, or stylized figures, but they are rendered in a clean, graphic manner that avoids anything that might resemble decay, disease, bodily fluids, or anything physically repulsive. While some shapes might be interpreted as slightly strange or ambiguous (such as the eye-like elements in the upper purple tendrils or the bulbous forms that could be abstract organs), they are too stylized and devoid of context to trigger a genuine sensation of disgust. The overall composition is more akin to a decorative or symbolic arrangement of abstract forms, rather than depicting any subject matter that would typically elicit an instinctual feeling of revulsion. The aesthetic leans towards the enigmatic or perhaps even the tribal/folkloric, but not the offensive or stomach-churning."
composizione-in-azzurro-1965.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The artwork is an abstract composition featuring a combination of geometric and curvilinear forms. The color palette, primarily consisting of various shades of blue, brown, black, and white, is harmonious and does not present any clashing or unsettling combinations that might provoke a visceral negative reaction. The lines are clean and precise, and the shapes are well-defined, exhibiting an orderly and contained quality rather than anything chaotic, messy, or putrefying. There are no representational elements that could be interpreted as unclean, offensive, decaying, or morally repugnant, which are common triggers for disgust. The visual information available does not suggest any themes of decay, squalor, or anything unsanitary. Therefore, there is virtually no visual or conceptual stimulus within this abstract print that would elicit a feeling of disgust. The score is marginally above zero to account for the highly subjective nature of emotional responses, but it is extremely low due to the complete lack of discernible qualities typically associated with evoking disgust."
composition-8.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. There are no visual elements commonly associated with this emotion, such as decay, rot, gore, filth, or bodily fluids. The color palette, while containing dark tones and some muted greens and browns, does not appear sickly or putrid. The various shapes and textures are abstract and organic, resembling perhaps plants, textiles, or decorative patterns, none of which inherently trigger a repulsive reaction. While some elements are fragmented or jumbled, creating a complex and somewhat busy composition, this visual complexity does not translate into a feeling of contamination or revulsion. The overall impression is more artistic and interpretive than aesthetically or viscerally off-putting. Any minuscule score acknowledges only the highly subjective possibility of a viewer finding certain abstract, undefined forms mildly unsettling, but certainly not genuinely disgusting in a conventional sense."
composition-vi-1913.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The emotion of disgust is almost entirely absent from Wassily Kandinsky's ""Composition VII."" The visual language of the painting, characterized by its vibrant color palette, dynamic interplay of lines, and swirling, energetic forms, does not present any elements commonly associated with feelings of revulsion or repulsion. There are no sickly, muddy, or decaying hues; instead, the colors, though complex and varied, tend towards brightness and harmonious juxtaposition, creating a sense of exhilaration or spiritual movement rather than visceral unpleasantness. The abstract shapes are fluid and expressive, lacking any discernible grotesque or contaminated forms that might trigger a sensation of disgust. While the composition is dense and chaotic, this complexity primarily evokes a sense of intense activity and internal rhythm, rather than disorder that is unclean or offensive. There is nothing in the implied textures or the overall visual narrative that suggests contamination, decay, or anything physically or aesthetically repulsive. Any fleeting sensation of discomfort due to the sheer intensity or visual ""noise"" of the work is far removed from true disgust, which implies a strong aversion or sickening feeling. Therefore, this painting offers virtually no visual cues to elicit a feeling of disgust."
concentric-1925.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, being entirely abstract, lacks any discernible elements or representations that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, decay, grotesque figures, unpleasant textures, or situations that are inherently repulsive or unsettling in a visceral way. The forms are geometric and organic shapes, lines, and color fields, all operating on a purely visual, non-representational plane. The colors, while varied and at times clashing, are vibrant and do not evoke a sense of sickness or putrefaction. There is no narrative content or implied context that could be morally or ethically offensive. The dynamic composition and interplay of shapes and colors aim for a sensory and possibly spiritual experience, rather than one of repulsion or aversion. Therefore, the visual information presented by this artwork provides virtually no stimulus for the emotion of disgust. A minimal score acknowledges the subjective possibility of any feeling, however remote, but functionally, it elicits no disgust."
construction-with-belltower-1932.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The color palette, composed of muted browns, greys, and desaturated blues, is earthy and subdued, entirely lacking any tones that might suggest decay, putrefaction, or unhygienic conditions. The subject matter, an abstract or cubist depiction of industrial and architectural elements such as a train, buildings, clocks, and symbols, is visually neutral and does not present anything inherently repulsive or offensive. There are no depictions of gore, filth, bodily fluids, or anything that would trigger a visceral or moral feeling of revulsion. The structured, geometric composition, while fragmented, maintains a visual order that does not convey chaos or unpleasantness. The work is contemplative and abstract, far removed from any imagery that typically elicits feelings of disgust."
conglomerat-1943.jpg,abstract,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The color palette, predominantly bright yellow and various shades of blue, with accents of red, purple, and green, is vibrant and clean, devoid of any muddy, sickly, or decaying hues that might trigger a viscerally unpleasant reaction. The forms are abstract and geometric, arranged in a structured, almost diagrammatic manner. There are no depictions of organic decay, bodily fluids, gore, filth, or any subject matter typically associated with contamination, illness, or putrefaction, which are common triggers for disgust. Even the more symbolic or illustrative elements, such as the stylized figures or the pointing hand, are rendered in a clean, graphic style that is more intellectual and playful than unsettling or repulsive. The overall aesthetic is one of order, composition, and visual language, far removed from anything that would prompt a feeling of revulsion or nausea."
composition-6.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting evokes a very minimal sense of disgust, as its primary visual language does not employ elements typically associated with this emotion. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, waste, explicit decay, putrefaction, disease, or any forms that are inherently grotesque or unclean in a way that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. The textures are rough and uneven in some areas, and the forms are fragmented and angular, which might suggest rupture or destruction. This fragmented quality, combined with the stark, almost oppressive black masses against the intense red background, could, for a very small fraction of viewers, evoke a very faint and indirect feeling of unease related to damage or disarray. However, this is more akin to a feeling of disturbance or somberness than outright disgust. The artwork's abstraction leans more towards conveying tension, struggle, or a weighty psychological state rather than aiming to repulse the viewer physically. Therefore, any sensation of disgust is extremely subtle, secondary, and not a direct or intended outcome of the visual composition."
composition-4.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting evokes very little to no sense of disgust. There are no explicit depictions of common disgust triggers such as decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or disease. The color palette, while featuring earthy tones, does not suggest putrefaction or unhealthiness; rather, it contributes to a complex, perhaps somber, aesthetic. While some organic shapes are present, such as the pinkish, possibly fleshy form in the upper-middle section or the fur-like texture at the bottom, these elements are highly stylized"
conversations-1958.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting is an abstract geometric composition characterized by clean lines, precise shapes (a rectangle, triangles, and an irregular polygon with a curved edge), and a limited, subdued color palette of white, light beige, grey, and mustard yellow/ochre. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with revulsion towards something offensive, unpleasant, contaminated, grotesque, or morally objectionable. There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that could reasonably evoke such a feeling. The aesthetic is orderly, minimalist, and non-representational, devoid of any subject matter, textures, or colors that are commonly perceived as repulsive, dirty, decayed, or jarringly unpleasant. The small grey lines within the yellow shape are simply compositional elements, not suggestive of anything vile. The overall impression is one of visual balance and intellectual abstraction rather than visceral unease or aversion. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate, indicating a complete absence of disgust."
core-36x48.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork is an abstract composition, primarily featuring radiating lines and geometric shapes, rendered in a palette of muted tones including warm beiges, light blues, and deep teals. There are no discernible elements within the painting—such as depictions of decay, grotesque figures, unsettling textures, unhygienic conditions, or any forms that might be interpreted as offensive or repulsive—that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. The overall impression is one of movement, light, and ethereal form, which does not contain any visual cues associated with revulsion or unpleasantness. Therefore, the artwork evokes no feeling of disgust."
composizione-paesaggio-dada-n-3-o-n-2-1921.jpg,abstract,25.0,"The sense of disgust evoked by this painting is relatively low, manifesting as a subtle undercurrent of unease rather than overt revulsion. This feeling primarily stems from the large, irregularly shaped, pale yellow/flesh-toned blob located in the upper right quadrant, which features a dark, almost black, void-like center. This biomorphic form can be interpreted as vaguely organic, possibly resembling an internal organ, a diseased growth, or a wound. Its ambiguous, somewhat visceral quality, combined with the deep, dark opening, can trigger a mild, instinctual recoil or a sense of discomfort that borders on aversion.

Similarly, the smaller, purple, blob-like shape beneath it also contributes to this subtle sensation, as does the large, amorphous dark mass in the lower right. These forms lack clear definition, which prevents them from being explicitly repulsive, but their abstract nature allows for interpretations that lean towards the unsettlingly biological or decayed. The muted, somewhat somber color palette further enhances a general mood of strangeness and mild disquiet, rather than explicit repulsion. However, the overall abstraction, the lack of explicit gore, filth, or traditionally disgusting subject matter, and the presence of other elements like the human eye and geometric shapes, largely mitigate a strong feeling of disgust, keeping it at a very subdued level."
crossing-1928.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this abstract composition that evokes feelings of disgust. The painting features an orderly arrangement of vertical dark lines against a subtly modulated background of earthy tones and lighter, geometric shapes suggesting light. There are no elements that are dirty, decaying, chaotic, visually offensive, or that suggest any kind of contamination or unpleasant physical sensation. The colors are muted and harmonious, the forms are clean and abstract, and the overall impression is one of structured visual exploration rather than anything repulsive or off-putting. Therefore, disgust is entirely absent as an emotional response to this artwork."
constructivo-1933.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The artwork, a symbolic and geometric composition by Joaquín Torres García, offers virtually no visual cues that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. There is no depiction of decay, contamination, bodily fluids, violence, suffering, or any grotesque or repulsive imagery. The figures are highly stylized and abstract, not rendered in a way that suggests illness, deformation, or anything physically repellent. The symbols represent universal concepts such as celestial bodies, elements, time, and humanity, which are generally neutral or positive in their common interpretation. The overall aesthetic is one of order, synthesis, and harmony, characterized by clean lines, clear segmentation, and an earthy color palette, none of which contribute to a sense of revulsion or nausea. The artwork’s symbolic nature aims for intellectual engagement and a sense of universal truth, rather than a visceral negative reaction. Therefore, the presence of disgust in response to this piece is negligible."
dance-i.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This artwork is a vibrant and meticulously constructed stained glass piece, characterized by its clean lines, geometric shapes (triangles, circles, and segments), and a palette of primary colors (blue, yellow, red) contrasted with white and black leading. The composition is highly organized and abstract, creating a sense of balance and visual harmony. There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that could trigger a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are offensive, repulsive, unclean, grotesque, or associated with decay and unpleasantness. This piece, on the contrary, presents a clean, orderly, and aesthetically pleasing arrangement of forms and colors. Its abstract nature avoids any potentially disturbing figurative representations, and its material (stained glass) inherently suggests light, transparency, and crafted beauty, diametrically opposing any sensation of revulsion. Therefore, there is no basis for experiencing disgust when viewing this artwork."
cycle-48x60.jpg,abstract,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The artwork is abstract, composed of dynamic, sweeping shapes and a palette dominated by warm earthy tones—golds, oranges, and various shades of brown, accented by some cool blues and purples. There is no representational subject matter that could trigger revulsion, such as decay, bodily fluids, waste, or anything conventionally perceived as unclean, rotten, or threatening to health. The forms, while energetic and somewhat fractured, are not grotesque or deformed in a manner that would induce nausea or a visceral sense of repulsion. The colors are rich and luminous, far from the sickly, murky, or jarring hues often associated with unpleasantness or contamination. The overall impression is one of movement, light, and perhaps geological or atmospheric forces, all presented in an aesthetically intriguing way that is devoid of any qualities commonly associated with the emotion of disgust."
dedicated-to-jacques-callot-1941.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The artwork features abstract, biomorphic forms in a stylized and somewhat whimsical manner. The color palette, composed of earthy tones, muted pastels, and gentle washes of red, green, blue, and yellow, is harmonious and visually calm, rather than jarring or nauseating. There are no elements within the composition—such as decay, gore, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or repulsive creatures—that would conventionally trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion. The forms, while ambiguous, lean towards playful or mysterious representations, entirely devoid of any grotesque or offensive qualities. The overall aesthetic is one of imaginative exploration, far removed from any imagery that could be perceived as contaminated, putrid, or morally repugnant."
double-impression-iv-1978.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork consists of abstract, white, somewhat pixelated or blocky shapes arranged on a solid, vibrant blue background. There is absolutely nothing in this image that could elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, contamination, unpleasant textures (like slime or grit in an unappetizing context), or things that are fundamentally repulsive or offensive to one's sensory perception or moral sensibilities. This artwork is clean, visually orderly, uses bright and non-threatening colors, and its abstract nature offers no literal representations that could be construed as revolting or offensive. The texture of the white shapes, while perhaps slightly rough or chalky, is not presented in a way that suggests anything unsanitary or nauseating. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent."
de-tio-st-rsta-n-10-alderdomen-1907.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this artwork that evokes the emotion of disgust. The color palette, composed of soft blues, muted reds/pinks, warm yellows, and a pale pink background, is harmonious and gentle, entirely devoid of the murky, sickly, or overly jarring tones often associated with repulsion. Furthermore, the forms are abstract and orderly, featuring clean geometric squares and fluid, elegant spirals and stylized floral motifs. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or anything that would suggest uncleanliness or putrefaction. The overall impression is one of balance, serenity, and a meditative order, which directly counteracts any potential for feelings of revulsion or distaste. The visual language of the painting is refined and aesthetically pleasing, presenting no visual cues that would trigger a visceral or psychological reaction of disgust."
deux-styles-1958.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork is an abstract composition characterized by clean geometric shapes, bold lines, and a vibrant color palette consisting primarily of blue, red, black, and white. There are absolutely no elements within this visual presentation that could trigger a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by stimuli associated with decay, filth, contamination, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, or things perceived as morally repugnant. This painting, however, presents a purely aesthetic arrangement of forms and colors. Its precise lines, sharp angles, and smooth curves are devoid of any organic textures that might suggest decomposition or unpleasantness. The color choices are strong and dynamic but not inherently nauseating or disturbing. There is no representational content that could be interpreted as unhygienic, disturbing, or morally objectionable. The overall impression is one of organized design and visual energy, entirely antithetical to the triggers for disgust."
dialogue-i-1967.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract composition of lines, shapes, and patterns, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by stimuli associated with contamination, decay, waste, or things perceived as unhygienic or harmful. This painting contains none of these elements. The colors, primarily muted greens, browns, and whites with accents of teal and red, are earthy and subdued, not sickly or nauseating. The forms are abstract and geometric or organically flowing, devoid of any discernible representational content that could be considered repulsive, such as bodily fluids, decay, or unsettling creatures. There is no sense of messiness, dirt, or unpleasant tactile sensations implied by the textures. The overall impression is one of visual complexity and symbolic communication rather than anything that would induce revulsion. A score of 0.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association, but objectively, there is nothing within the artwork's visual language that aligns with common triggers for disgust."
duo-duel-1953.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract artwork, characterized by its bold use of bright yellow and dark black, precise linear elements, and sharp geometric forms, offers no visual cues that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. Disgust is an emotion commonly associated with perceptions of contamination, decay, filth, bodily effluvia, or morally repugnant acts. The print, being an abstract composition, does not depict any recognizable objects, scenes, or figures that could be interpreted as unwholesome, putrefying, or offensive in a visceral sense. The colors, while strong, are not inherently repulsive, and the crisp, orderly lines and defined shapes convey a sense of intentional design and graphic precision rather than disarray or unpleasantness. There is no suggestion of dirt, disease, or anything grotesque. Therefore, the artwork entirely lacks any attributes that would elicit a feeling of revulsion or nausea."
draft-for-mural-in-the-unjuried-art-show-wall-b-1922.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting, a vibrant and complex abstract work by Wassily Kandinsky, offers very little to evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily fluids, or anything perceived as vile, repulsive, or contaminated. This artwork features a rich and diverse palette of bright, contrasting colors—yellows, greens, reds, blues, purples, and white—set against a dark background. These colors are lively and dynamic, far from the sickly, muddy, or dull hues often associated with decay or illness. The forms are abstract, a mix of geometric shapes, organic curves, sharp lines, and intricate patterns (like checkered sections, dots, and wavy lines). While some elements might suggest movement, machinery, or fragmented natural forms, none of them are depicted in a way that is grotesque, putrid, or inherently repulsive. There are no visceral representations, no suggestion of rot, disease, or unpleasant textures like sliminess or grime. The overall impression is one of energetic visual harmony and complex interplay, stimulating the mind and eye rather than repelling them. The dynamic composition and vibrant elements are more likely to provoke curiosity, excitement, or contemplation, making the evocation of disgust almost entirely absent. A minimal score is given only to acknowledge the highly subjective nature of art interpretation, where an individual might, under very specific and unusual circumstances, find the chaos or a particular combination of shapes mildly unsettling, but this would be an outlier response to disgust, not a primary or intended one."
drawing-in-black-and-white-1962.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The emotion of disgust is fundamentally linked to a sense of revulsion, often triggered by things perceived as contaminated, foul, diseased, decaying, or morally repugnant. When evaluating this abstract painting, there is virtually no visual information or interpretive potential that would elicit such a response. The artwork primarily employs a palette of dark browns, blacks, tans, and hints of white, silver, and green. These colors are largely neutral and earthy; none of them are sickly, putrid, or suggestive of decay. The forms within the composition are abstract and angular, resembling fragmented architectural elements, layered textures, or perhaps highly stylized figures. While some abstract works can evoke discomfort through chaotic or jarring compositions, this piece maintains a sense of structured deconstruction rather than a chaotic mess that might hint at filth or disorder in a disgusting way. There are no depictions of gore, waste, rot, illness, or anything that would activate a primal or learned aversion response. The brushstrokes and textural variations contribute to the visual interest without suggesting anything unhygienic or repulsive. Therefore, there is no discernible element within the painting's form, color, texture, or implied subject matter that would trigger feelings of disgust. A score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or extremely niche personal association, but for the vast majority of viewers, disgust would not be a relevant emotional response."
e-1915.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There are no elements within this vibrant, abstract painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues related to decay, filth, bodily fluids, contamination, or morally reprehensible acts. The artwork, characterized by its bold colors, geometric shapes, and dynamic composition (including checkerboard patterns, diamond patterns, and concentric circles), presents a visually stimulating and energetic tableau. The colors are bright and distinct, and the forms are abstract and playful, rather than depicting anything grotesque, unclean, or unsettling. There is no sense of decay, messiness in a repulsive way, or any subject matter that would trigger a visceral aversion or moral revulsion. The painting's aesthetic is clean, sharp, and visually engaging, antithetical to the triggers of disgust."
energy-field-1967.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork, characterized by its abstract nature and a palette dominated by muted yellows, oranges, subtle pinks, and white lines against a warm, earthy background, presents absolutely no visual cues or thematic elements that could evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by sensory stimuli associated with decay, contamination, filth, grotesque imagery, or morally repugnant content. This painting contains none of these. The lines are clean, the shapes are geometric and abstract, and the colors are harmonious and subdued, far from anything jarring or sickening. There are no textures that suggest slime or rot, no forms that resemble unwholesome organic matter, and no narrative context that implies anything vile or offensive. The overall impression is one of intricate design and visual order, completely devoid of any stimuli that would lead to a visceral sensation of revulsion or aversion."
encirclement.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this abstract painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are repulsive, offensive, unclean, decaying, or morally abhorrent. This artwork presents none of those qualities. The painting consists of simple geometric shapes (circles and a rectangle) rendered in bold, clean colors—a vibrant blue background, a strong black central area, and bright, almost luminous orange circles. The colors are high contrast but not sickly, muddy, or aesthetically unpleasant in a way that would trigger revulsion. The texture, created by visible brushstrokes, suggests an active hand in its creation but does not mimic anything physically disgusting like grime, decay, or biological waste. There are no grotesque figures, disturbing scenes, or narrative elements that could be interpreted as offensive or repulsive. The composition is straightforward and visually direct, offering no chaotic or unsettling elements that might lead to a sense of aesthetic revulsion. The artwork is purely an exploration of color, form, and texture, and in no way presents anything that would cause a visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea."
erotic-6.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric and curvilinear forms in a limited palette of white, black, various shades of grey, and accents of peach and red-orange, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by something repulsive, offensive, unclean, decaying, or morally abhorrent, often accompanied by a visceral sensation of aversion or nausea.

This artwork, however, is characterized by its clean lines, precise shapes, and clear separation of colors. There are no elements that suggest decay, filth, disease, bodily fluids, or any form of physical or moral corruption. The shapes, while abstract and potentially suggestive of fragmented figures, are presented in a highly stylized and desensitized manner, devoid of any raw or grotesque qualities that might provoke a visceral negative reaction. The colors are crisp and well-defined, with no muddy or sickly tones. The overall composition is balanced and formally resolved, not chaotic or disturbing in a way that would lead to revulsion. The artistic intention appears to be one of formal exploration and aesthetic contemplation rather than confrontational or disturbing imagery. Therefore, there are no visual cues within this painting that would activate a feeling of disgust."
espacillimit-1957.jpg,abstract,0.1,"This painting, characterized by its clear, crisp geometric shapes and bold, primary colors (red, yellow, blue, black, white, grey), elicits virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are offensive, repulsive, or inherently unpleasant, often associated with decay, contamination, or violation. This artwork, however, is abstract and non-representational, devoid of any subject matter that could be perceived as grotesque, filthy, or morally repugnant. The lines are clean, the colors are vibrant and distinct, and the composition is organized, even playful in its arrangement of forms. There are no disturbing textures, unsettling patterns (like those associated with trypophobia), or chaotic elements that might induce a visceral feeling of revulsion. The overall impression is one of visual clarity and design rather than anything that would trigger a negative physical or emotional response akin to disgust. A score of 0.1 is given to acknowledge the impossibility of a true ""0"" in subjective human experience, but it effectively communicates the complete absence of this emotion in response to the artwork."
espacillimit.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This artwork, characterized by its sharp geometric forms, clean lines, and vibrant yet controlled color palette of blues, blacks, whites, and touches of coral, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust, as an emotional response, is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or a perceived violation of aesthetic or moral purity. None of these elements are present here. The composition is highly organized and precise, almost architectural in its structure, conveying order and clarity rather than chaos or decay. The colors are flat and distinct, lacking any muddiness or sickly tones that might induce nausea. There are no organic shapes that could be misinterpreted as visceral or repellent, nor any narrative content that implies moral transgression or abject conditions. The overall impression is one of crispness, design, and abstract harmony, which stands in stark opposition to anything that would provoke revulsion or a feeling of being soiled. Therefore, the emotional register for disgust remains entirely untouched by this piece."
euphoria-dada-1917.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract artwork, characterized by its vibrant and fragmented forms, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The composition features an interplay of geometric and organic shapes rendered in a diverse palette of colors including yellow, red, blue, green, brown, and grey. While the forms are non-representational and somewhat chaotic, there is nothing within their arrangement, texture, or color scheme that suggests decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, or any other visual cue commonly associated with revulsion. The brushstrokes are expressive and painterly, contributing to the work's dynamic quality rather than creating any tactile or visual unpleasantness. The overall impression is one of visual energy and abstract contemplation, completely devoid of any element that would trigger a visceral or cognitive response of disgust."
ezinor-1949.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting, characterized by its geometric shapes and a limited palette of white/cream, dark green, and black, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things perceived as foul, contaminating, decaying, unhygienic, or morally repugnant. The artwork presents none of these qualities. The lines are clean and precise, the colors are subdued and aesthetically pleasing rather than sickly or putrid, and the overall composition is orderly and balanced. There is no representational content that could be interpreted as repulsive, nor are there any textures suggested that might feel unpleasant or slimy. The visual information conveyed is purely abstract and formal, devoid of any elements that would activate the brain's disgust response pathways."

Disgust is typically aroused by elements that are unhygienic, decaying, grotesque, morally repugnant, or physically repulsive (such as gore or slime). The artwork, an abstract composition, presents clean, stylized forms rendered with clear lines and a palette of yellows, browns, greys, black, and a touch of purple. There are no visual cues—be they colors, textures, shapes, or implied subject matter—that suggest anything putrid, offensive, or otherwise capable of triggering a feeling of revulsion or nausea. While the fragmented and mechanical abstraction might be disorienting or challenging to interpret for some viewers, these sensations do not translate to disgust. The painting is characterized by its dynamic energy and formal experimentation, entirely devoid of the visual properties that induce this specific emotion."
eroticon-1990.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting does not elicit any discernible feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically a strong negative emotional response associated with something perceived as repulsive, sickening, or offensive, often with a visceral component linked to avoiding contamination or harm. This abstract, geometric composition contains none of the elements commonly associated with disgust. There is no disturbing subject matter, grotesque forms, chaotic textures, or nauseating color combinations. The lines are clean, the shapes are abstract and orderly, and the color palette (comprising whites, blacks, greys, a muted blue, a warm gold/ochre, and a soft rose/mauve) is harmonious and aesthetically pleasing rather than jarring or unsettling. The artwork's nature is analytical and decorative, completely devoid of any characteristics that would trigger a visceral or psychological reaction of revulsion or distaste. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent."
fairy-tale-1970c.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting is a highly abstract and vibrant composition characterized by a complex interplay of organic and geometric shapes, bold colors, and dynamic lines. There is very little in its visual language that would evoke a sensation of disgust. The colors, while intense and sometimes clashing, are generally bright and lively, not suggestive of decay, illness, or putrefaction. The forms are fluid and imaginative, resembling abstract floral motifs, swirling energy, or fragmented figures, but none of these elements are rendered in a way that is grotesque, unhygienic, or repulsive. There are no textures that appear slimy, festering, or otherwise viscerally unpleasant. The overall impression is one of energetic complexity and artistic exploration, rather than anything that would trigger revulsion or nausea. Any minimal score for disgust would stem from a highly idiosyncratic or conceptual interpretation of chaotic visual information as overwhelming or unsettling, rather than a direct sensory trigger of revulsion. However, the visual elements themselves offer almost no cues for disgust in a general sense."
farfalla.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract composition solely for its capacity to evoke disgust, I find no elements within the artwork that would trigger such an emotion. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or a profound sense of violation or repulsion. This painting, however, presents a clean, orderly, and harmonious arrangement of geometric and soft organic shapes. The color palette consists of balanced and rather pleasing tones: a deep, rich green framing the composition, stark black segments, calming light blue shapes, a soft, ethereal white/light grey oval, bright yellow rectangles, and a central cross-like structure rendered in varying shades of dark teal/green. All lines are crisp, and the transitions between colors and shapes are deliberate and smooth. There is no visual cacophony, no jarring discordance in color or form, and certainly no imagery that suggests unpleasantness, decay, or anything physically or morally offensive. The painting's aesthetic leans towards tranquility, balance, and a contemplative order, entirely devoid of the qualities that would induce a feeling of revulsion or disgust."
figure-rose-1937.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting, characterized by its abstract and geometric forms, muted color palette (greys, greens, browns, and whites), and clean lines, contains absolutely no visual elements that would trigger a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are offensive, repulsive, unhygienic, grotesque, or that suggest decay, illness, or moral corruption. The artwork presents a composed, almost architectural arrangement of shapes and planes, devoid of any organic matter that could decay, bodily fluids, gore, or distorted, unsettling figures. The aesthetic is one of deliberate order and formal exploration, rather than anything chaotic, messy, or inherently unpleasant. There are no disturbing narratives, repulsive textures, or unsettling color combinations that could provoke such a visceral negative reaction. Therefore, the painting elicits no sensation of disgust whatsoever."
football.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this abstract artwork that elicits any feeling of disgust. The piece is composed of vibrant, primary, and secondary colors (red, blue, green, yellow) applied with what appears to be crayon or pastel, resulting in a somewhat textured, almost energetic visual quality. The forms are entirely geometric and abstract, consisting of angular lines, rectangles, and triangles that intersect and overlap. There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as repulsive, unclean, grotesque, or morally offensive. The lines are crisp, and the color application, while varied in density, does not suggest anything unappealing or foul.

figuras-a-cinco-colores-1946.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The emotion of disgust typically arises from encounters with substances or concepts perceived as unclean, contaminated, noxious, or morally repugnant. This abstract painting, characterized by its geometric shapes, clean lines, and primary color palette (red, yellow, blue, black, and white), presents no visual cues that align with these triggers. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, or any grotesque or unsettling imagery. Furthermore, as an abstract work, it lacks narrative content or symbolic representations that could evoke moral outrage or revulsion. While individual aesthetic preferences vary, the composition is structured and the colors are vibrant, presenting a visually clean and orderly appearance rather than something chaotic or jarring in a way that would provoke a visceral feeling of disgust. The slight imperfections in the application of paint are typical of a hand-painted piece and do not cross into territory that would be considered repulsive. Therefore, the visual information conveyed by this artwork is antithetical to generating a feeling of disgust. The score is marginally above zero to acknowledge the remote theoretical possibility of a highly idiosyncratic and subjective response, but practically speaking, it elicits no disgust."
four-crosses-1924.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting does not inherently contain any visual elements commonly associated with evoking disgust. There is no representation of decay, disease, bodily fluids, filth, or any subject matter typically deemed repulsive. The abstract nature of the artwork, with its vibrant and swirling colors (blues, purples, greens, reds, oranges), dynamic composition, and energetic brushstrokes, leans more towards feelings of movement, cosmic energy, or emotional expression rather than aversion. While abstraction can sometimes be unsettling, the forms and colors used here do not suggest anything malformed, grotesque, or unhygienic. The central mass, despite its organic appearance, is too abstract to definitively represent something biologically unpleasant, and the overall visual language of the painting avoids any characteristics that would typically trigger a visceral feeling of disgust. The score is very low to reflect the strong absence of any direct or indirect visual cues that would provoke this specific emotion."
golden-people-1999.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting presents a collection of organically shaped, colored blocks and forms. The colors used are a mix of earthy tones (browns, greens, oranges) and some brighter accents (blues, purples, light greens). The textures within these shapes are predominantly linear patterns, grids, or solid fills. There is absolutely nothing within the visual elements of this artwork – the shapes, colors, textures, or overall composition – that could be perceived as offensive, repulsive, nauseating, unclean, or indicative of decay or contamination. The forms are abstract and non-representational, therefore lacking any potential to depict grotesque or unsettling subject matter. The aesthetic is one of visual exploration and balance, completely devoid of any stimuli typically associated with eliciting a feeling of disgust."
gr-relief-ii-1932.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The artwork primarily evokes feelings of order, mechanism, and a certain stark elegance, none of which are inherently tied to disgust. However, a very minimal, almost negligible level of disgust could theoretically arise from certain nuanced interpretations. The white elements, while largely clean-looking, possess a slightly granular or pitted texture in some areas, which, to an extremely sensitive viewer, might vaguely suggest a surface that isn't perfectly pristine, perhaps akin to something aged or slightly corroded rather than smooth and new. Furthermore, the overall industrial or mechanical aesthetic, while often appreciated, can, for a very small fraction of individuals, trigger a mild aversion due to associations with coldness, impersonal systems, or even the potential for friction and abrasion, though this is a highly subjective and weak link to true disgust. There is absolutely nothing putrid, decaying, unhygienic, or morally repugnant depicted, which are the primary drivers of disgust. Thus, any trace of this emotion is extremely marginal and dependent on a highly specific and atypical interpretation of very subtle textural or thematic cues."
fire-flower-made-in-cooperation-with-galyna-zubchenko-and-victor-zaretsky-1960c.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The artwork elicits virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by elements related to contamination, decay, unpleasant bodily functions, or moral repugnance. This piece, however, is visually clean, vibrant, and appears to be meticulously crafted. The central motif is an abstract, colorful star-like or heart-like form radiating energy, surrounded by smaller, stylized celestial elements. The bright colors, intricate patterns, and the perceived warmth of the natural materials (straw, wood veneer, or similar on an oriented strand board background) actively work against any feeling of revulsion. There are no grotesque, dirty, unsettling, or disturbing images. While the raw, textured quality of the OSB background might not appeal to everyone's aesthetic taste, or some might find the busy detail overwhelming, these are mild aesthetic preferences and do not constitute a response of true disgust, which is a much stronger, visceral emotion of aversion or revulsion. The extremely low score reflects the near absence of any features that would typically trigger such a reaction."
fragile-1931.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting, characterized by its deep blue background and geometric forms in white, grey, and yellow, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are offensive to the senses, such as bodily fluids, decay, filth, or objects that signify disease, contamination, or moral revulsion. None of these elements are present in the artwork. The shapes are clean and abstract, composed of lines, circles, triangles, and an arc, which are organized in a structured and aesthetically pleasing manner. The color palette, predominantly blue with white and grey accents, is visually calm and unthreatening. There are no textures or forms that mimic anything repulsive or unsanitary. The overall impression is one of visual harmony and intellectual engagement, rather than any visceral negative reaction. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent in the contemplation of this piece."
han-i-on-yellow-1955.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The colors are predominantly muted, earthy tones of reddish-browns against a light, creamy background, with a single small light blue accent. While some shades of brown can, in certain contexts, be associated with things that provoke disgust (like bodily waste or decay), here they appear more akin to natural pigments, raw earth, or the texture of aged materials. The shapes are abstract and irregular, but they do not represent anything inherently repulsive such as gore, illness, rot, vermin, or contamination. The texture, though somewhat rough and uneven, does not translate into a feeling of sliminess, stickiness, or anything typically considered viscerally disgusting. There is no narrative or discernible subject matter that would trigger a psychological or moral feeling of disgust. The overall impression is one of earthy abstraction and textural exploration, rather than revulsion or offensiveness. A score above zero is only given to account for the extremely remote and highly subjective possibility that an individual might have an idiosyncratic aversion to certain textures or muted color palettes that they personally associate with something slightly unappealing, but this is not a general or intended response."
goat-1934.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There are no visual elements within this painting that evoke a sense of disgust. The artwork features a stylized depiction of an animal, likely a goat or antelope, rendered with fluid lines and a palette dominated by natural greens, browns, and whites, accented with light blue. None of these colors are presented in a manner that suggests decay, putrefaction, or contamination. The forms are abstract but do not depict bodily fluids, waste, disease, or any grotesque distortions that typically trigger a disgust response. The animal itself appears whole and in a neutral or perhaps active pose, rather than being portrayed in a state of injury, filth, or decomposition. The overall aesthetic is clean and artistic, devoid of any repulsive or offensive subject matter. Therefore, no feeling of revulsion, nausea, or strong aversion is generated by viewing this image."
hot-air-balloon-1926.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of disgust in this painting, I find absolutely no elements present that would elicit such a response. Disgust is typically evoked by imagery that is physically repulsive, decayed, unhygienic, or morally offensive. This abstract composition, with its clean geometric forms—a striped sphere, a cylinder, and various rectangular planes—set against a serene light green background, offers nothing of that nature. The colors used, including vibrant red, yellow, and green, along with more subdued black and grays, are harmoniously arranged and do not create any sense of visual discomfort, dissonance, or nausea. There are no depictions of decay, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or disturbing scenarios. The painting is a formal exploration of shape, color, and depth, presented in a very controlled and aesthetically neutral manner. Its visual language is devoid of any provocative or unsettling qualities that might trigger aversion or revulsion in a viewer. Therefore, the emotional register for disgust remains at a complete zero."
hanging-garden-1973.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The artwork is abstract and primarily features a bold blue central shape surrounded by darker, organic forms set against an earthy yellow and orange background. There are no elements within the composition that typically trigger disgust. The colors used are generally pleasant or neutral (vibrant blue, warm yellows, black), and do not resemble anything sickly, putrid, or decaying. The shapes are curvilinear and abstract, not depicting grotesque figures, bodily fluids, filth, decay, or anything that might be universally perceived as revolting or unclean. The texture visible in the crops appears to be that of paint or crayon on paper, which is a normal artistic medium and does not suggest any unpleasant material. There is no narrative or symbolic content that could induce revulsion. The overall impression is one of artistic abstraction rather than anything designed to provoke an adverse visceral reaction. The score is not zero only to account for the minuscule, almost negligible, possibility of an extremely idiosyncratic and personal association with any visual element that might inadvertently trigger a slight, almost imperceptible, flicker of discomfort for a highly sensitive individual, which is extremely unlikely given the neutral nature of the imagery."
holding-it-together-48x48.jpg,abstract,0.1,"This abstract painting presents no visual cues that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The color palette, composed primarily of cool blues and grays, warm browns and purples, and luminous creams, is harmonious and aesthetically pleasing, entirely devoid of sickly or putrid tones commonly associated with repulsion. The forms are dynamic and abstract, suggesting shards, flowing ribbons, or architectural elements, but they do not resemble anything decayed, contaminated, grotesque, or organically unpleasant. There are no textures that imply slime, grime, or decomposition. The overall impression is one of movement, light, and structured chaos, which might evoke feelings of intrigue, awe, or perhaps slight tension due to its energetic composition, but absolutely nothing that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or distaste. The painting is clean in its execution and conceptualization, offering nothing that would be perceived as offensive, repulsive, or inherently unclean."
hangingon-60x48.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting, an abstract composition of fragmented planes and dynamic light, offers very little to provoke the emotion of disgust. There are no visual cues typically associated with this feeling, such as grotesque imagery, organic decay, bodily fluids, filth, or unappetizing textures. The color palette, consisting primarily of earthy browns, deep blues, and warm oranges, with striking red accents, is rich and complex but not sickly or jarring in a way that would induce revulsion. While some dark areas might convey a sense of weight or depth, they do not suggest anything putrid or repulsive. The sharp, angular forms suggest structure, breakage, or light reflections rather than anything biologically or aesthetically offensive. The small textured elements in the upper right, while abstract, do not resemble anything decayed or unsanitary. Any minimal score for disgust would only arise from a highly idiosyncratic or tangential association, perhaps a fleeting impression of something broken or discarded, but this is far from a direct or strong evocation of the emotion. Overall, the painting's aesthetic impact leans towards dynamism, introspection, or the interplay of light and shadow, not visceral repulsion."
house-on-the-water-1930.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract composition, I find absolutely no elements within the artwork that evoke disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, contamination, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or morally repulsive subject matter. This painting, however, presents a serene and orderly arrangement of geometric forms and overlapping color fields. The palette primarily consists of various shades of blue, peach, and cream, which are generally perceived as harmonious and aesthetically pleasing, rather than jarring or sickening. The clean lines and translucent effects contribute to a sense of intellectual exploration of color and light, not a visceral reaction of revulsion. There are no chaotic forms, muddy textures, or unsettling juxtapositions that would even remotely suggest a connection to the unpleasant or the offensive. The work is devoid of any narrative or symbolic content that could be interpreted as morally repugnant. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent when observing this piece."
ile-de-france-1935.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this abstract painting that evokes a sense of disgust. The artwork is composed of clean-edged, mostly geometric and some curvilinear shapes, rendered in a palette of cool blues, grays, whites, and some warm earthy tones (browns, olive green, purples). The colors are harmonious and subdued, not sickly, jarring, or associated with anything unpleasant. The forms themselves are abstract and do not represent anything inherently repulsive, such as decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or disturbing scenes. The composition is orderly and balanced, suggesting a sense of calm and structure rather than chaos or anything that might trigger a visceral negative reaction. There are no implied textures that would feel slimy, gritty, or unclean. The overall aesthetic is one of abstract exploration of form and color, devoid of any narrative or visual elements that would elicit disgust."
immanence-2004.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The artwork, with its intricate network of lines, organic forms, and subtle washes of color, does not evoke any sense of disgust. There are no visual elements that depict decay, filth, gore, or anything inherently repulsive or unpleasant to the senses. The imagery is abstract and dynamic, with forms that might suggest natural phenomena, maps, or diagrams, but none of these carry negative connotations that would elicit a feeling of revulsion. The color palette, though varied, is generally harmonious and not jarring or sickly. The detailed line work and overall composition, while complex, appear more as an exploration of energy and interconnectedness rather than a portrayal of anything physically or morally offensive. The very low score reflects the complete absence of any visual triggers for disgust in this piece."
grey-space.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting is an abstract composition characterized by dynamic lines, fragmented geometric shapes, and a textured, largely grey background. When evaluating for disgust, typical triggers such as depictions of decay, bodily fluids, unsanitary conditions, putrefaction, or morally vile acts are entirely absent. The colors, while varied and at times stark, are not inherently nauseating or sickly. The shapes are angular and energetic, not grotesque or distorted in a repulsive manner.

The only elements that *could*, with a significant stretch of interpretation and a very low threshold for disgust, be remotely associated with anything unpleasant are the abstract black splatters or smudges visible particularly in the central and lower-left areas. These marks might be loosely associated with ""messiness"" or ""grime"" by some observers. However, they are clearly integrated into the artistic composition as stylized brushstrokes or energetic marks rather than literal representations of dirt or contamination. They lack the visual cues (such as texture, viscosity, or context) that would strongly evoke a visceral sense of revulsion or uncleanness.

The overall impression is one of energetic chaos, dynamism, or visual fragmentation, rather than anything that would trigger the specific emotion of disgust. The visual information does not suggest anything putrid, diseased, filthy, or morally repugnant. Therefore, the level of disgust evoked by this artwork is extremely low, bordering on non-existent, acknowledging only a highly attenuated and indirect association some might make between abstract ""messiness"" and a very mild form of aversion."
improvisation-209-1917(1).jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, ""Cossacks"" by Wassily Kandinsky, is an early abstract work characterized by vibrant colors, dynamic forms, and a sense of energetic movement. There is absolutely nothing within the visual language of this artwork that would elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are physically repulsive, such as decay, filth, gore, disease, or extreme ugliness that triggers a visceral reaction of revulsion. Alternatively, it can be a moral response to something deeply offensive or depraved. This painting, however, offers none of these characteristics. The forms, while fragmented and abstract, are not grotesque or sickening. The colors are bold and lively, not muted, sickly, or indicative of putrefaction. The overall impression is one of artistic experimentation and dynamism, not decay or repulsion. Therefore, a score extremely close to zero is warranted, reflecting the complete absence of any elements that would trigger this specific emotion. The 0.5 allows for the infinitesimally small chance that someone might find any abstract representation inherently ""disgusting"" due to a complete rejection of the style, but this is a personal aesthetic preference, not a direct response to the content or execution that would typically generate the emotion of disgust."
invention-composition-31-1933.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting presents a composition of clean, geometric shapes and planes rendered in a harmonious palette of muted greens, blues, purples, and yellows, set against a light background. There are absolutely no visual cues or stylistic elements that typically evoke the emotion of disgust. The forms are crisp and defined, lacking any organic or decaying qualities. The colors are fresh and clean, avoiding any sickly, murky, or jarring combinations often associated with decay, illness, or contamination. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the work means there is no literal representation of bodily fluids, waste, gore, or other common triggers for disgust. The overall impression is one of intellectual playfulness, spatial dynamics, and clean aesthetic design, entirely devoid of anything that might be perceived as repulsive, unclean, or morally objectionable in a way that would trigger a visceral reaction of disgust."
john.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The artwork is an abstract composition primarily featuring black ink or paint strokes on a light background, with very small accents of muted color. The forms are calligraphic, scribbled, and linear, creating a sense of dynamic movement and visual texture. There are no discernible figurative elements that depict decay, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or anything inherently grotesque or repulsive. The color palette, dominated by black and light beige, does not evoke any sense of revulsion. While some of the strokes are sharp or chaotic, they do not suggest a subject matter or aesthetic quality that would trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. The overall impression is one of artistic expression and experimentation rather than something that would cause nausea or moral revulsion. A very low score is assigned because there is nothing in the visual content or implied subject matter that would activate the emotion of disgust. The minor score of 5 (rather than 0) acknowledges the subjective nature of interpretation, where an individual might find extreme disorder or specific, abstract shapes to be mildly unsettling in a very personal way, but this is highly unlikely for the emotion of disgust in this particular artwork."
komposition-1950.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this artwork that elicits any sense of disgust. The piece is an abstract composition of geometric and organic shapes, rendered in a palette of muted browns, grays, whites, and soft blue-greys, set against a warm, light background. The colors are harmonious and earthy, evoking a sense of calm and natural tones rather than anything putrid, sickly, or decaying. The forms themselves are clean, well-defined, and visually intriguing, with no suggestion of grotesqueness, dirtiness, or repulsive textures. Some areas feature subtle stippling or speckling, but these are aesthetic embellishments that add visual interest, not an impression of grime, decay, or disease. The overall composition is balanced and thoughtfully arranged, contributing to a sense of order and artistic intention, rather than chaos or anything that might trigger a visceral negative reaction. There are no disturbing figures, unpleasant subject matter, or sensory cues that would align with feelings of revulsion or moral indignation. The artwork is visually appealing and intellectually stimulating through its abstraction, entirely devoid of elements that would register as disgusting."
kateau-1953.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, an abstract composition of blue and purple shapes and lines on a light grey background, presents no elements typically associated with disgust. The colors used are cool and neutral (blue, purple, grey), and do not evoke sensations of decay, illness, contamination, or unhygienic conditions. The shapes are abstract, ranging from organic and curvilinear to geometric and linear; none of them resemble anything putrid, vile, grotesque, or physically repulsive. There are no depictions of waste, bodily fluids, rot, insects, or any other visual cues that commonly trigger a feeling of aversion or nausea. The overall aesthetic is clean, orderly, and visually balanced. As such, there is absolutely nothing within the artwork's visual language that would elicit a feeling of disgust in the viewer."
jesenji-dan-70-cm-x-50-cm-akril-na-paliru-2016.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting, characterized by its thick, impasto application and vibrant, often contrasting colors, does not inherently evoke feelings of disgust. The primary palette of rich blues, energetic yellows, and bold reds, combined with the dynamic and gestural brushstrokes, conveys a sense of movement and vitality rather than decay, filth, or sickness. While the textures are very pronounced and tactile, they read as the physical presence of paint on a surface, not as something putrid, slimy, or repulsive. There are no forms or color combinations that suggest organic decomposition, bodily fluids, or waste. The chaos, if perceived, is one of expressive energy rather than disturbing disarray or contamination. Any minimal sensation that might approach discomfort (leading to a score above zero) could only arise from a highly subjective and atypical interpretation of the raw, unblended texture or the intensity of certain color juxtapositions, where some might find the sheer physical presence of the material slightly overwhelming or ""messy"" rather than aesthetically pleasing, but this is far from triggering genuine revulsion or nausea. The artwork fundamentally lacks the visual cues typically associated with disgust."
l-enclume-1952.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an abstract artwork, this painting does not present any discernible subject matter that could inherently provoke a feeling of disgust. The color palette consists primarily of earthy tones – beiges, browns, muted ochres, and grays – accented by soft blues, oranges, and whites. These colors are harmonious and natural, devoid of any hues typically associated with illness, decay, or repulsive substances. The forms are fluid, organic, and curvilinear, creating a sense of gentle movement and flow rather than jaggedness or grotesqueness. There are no sharp, aggressive, or disturbing shapes, nor any visual textures that suggest sliminess, grittiness, or anything unsanitary. The overall composition is balanced and contemplative, lacking any elements of chaos, filth, or moral transgression that would typically trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. The artwork offers a serene and aesthetically pleasing visual experience, entirely free from any cues that might elicit revulsion or aversion."
kompozycja-morska-wenus-1933.jpg,abstract,0.1,"This abstract painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The color palette, consisting of earthy browns, a light sky blue, white, and black lines against a muted background, is generally neutral and inoffensive. There are no colors that are jarring, sickly, or associated with decay or contamination. The shapes are organic, amoeboid, and flowing, reminiscent of natural forms like landmasses, puddles, or soft clouds, rather than anything grotesque or repulsive. There is no visual depiction of bodily fluids, waste, rot, disease, filth, violence, or any other imagery typically associated with a feeling of disgust. The lines are simply abstract meanders, devoid of any specific meaning that could trigger a negative visceral reaction. The overall composition is calm and abstract, offering no narrative or representational elements that could be interpreted as morally or physically repugnant. Therefore, based purely on the visual elements, the painting does not contain any cues that would elicit disgust."
lines-1922.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The painting, an abstract work by Wassily Kandinsky, does not aim to evoke feelings of disgust. There are no elements within the composition that suggest decay, filth, contamination, or anything physically or morally repugnant. The forms are abstract and fluid, consisting of lines, geometric shapes, and organic masses of color. The palette is diverse, with vibrant and muted tones, but none are used in a way that suggests unpleasantness or an unhealthy state. There are no disturbing textures or visual cues that would trigger a visceral reaction of aversion. While some abstract works might create a sense of unease or confusion, this particular piece does not contain any visual information (such as graphic content, disturbing imagery, or representations of disease/uncleanliness) that would elicit disgust. The very low score accounts for the possibility that some individuals might find the chaotic arrangement of lines or certain color combinations mildly jarring or unappealing in a way that approaches a very slight, non-aversive discomfort, but this is far from a true sensation of disgust."
lanscape-ii-1960.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The color palette, while rich and varied, uses blues, greens, yellows, oranges, and deep reds that are vibrant and earthy, without any murky, sickly, or decaying tones that might suggest rot or unpleasantness. The forms are abstract and biomorphic, resembling stylized plants, clouds, or perhaps landscapes, but they are clean-lined and graphic. There is no representation of decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, violence, or anything typically associated with physical or moral repugnance. The composition is balanced and visually engaging, inviting contemplation of its abstract forms rather than eliciting any repulsive sensation. The overall impression is one of a vibrant, albeit abstract, natural scene or an imaginative landscape, entirely devoid of elements that would trigger disgust."
imploding-cosmos-1992.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting is abstract, featuring a central circular form composed of a dense, granular texture of small, irregular flecks primarily in earthy brown tones, interspersed with lighter beige, cream, and hints of muted blue/teal.

The score for disgust is very low because the painting lacks nearly all conventional visual cues that typically trigger this emotion. There is no representation of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, disease, or any subject matter widely considered repulsive or unsanitary. The abstract nature of the artwork also means there's no explicit narrative or recognizable object that could be inherently disgusting. The color palette, while featuring earthy browns, does not present them in a sickly, putrid, or decaying manner; the lighter tones and cool blues provide balance and visual interest. The composition is orderly and contained, which generally does not evoke a chaotic or disturbing feeling associated with disgust.

However, a very slight, almost negligible, degree of potential for mild discomfort or very low-level aversion, which could theoretically border on the periphery of disgust for a highly sensitive individual, stems from the very specific interpretation of the texture. If one were to abstractly imagine the dense, mottled mass as a highly magnified view of something vaguely organic and decaying (like a patch of dry mold, rust, or an undifferentiated mass of microscopic biological material) rather than a purely aesthetic texture, it *might* evoke a fleeting, sub-threshold sense of mild unease or unpleasantness. This is a highly subjective and remote possibility, as the primary impression is one of textural exploration and abstract form, not revulsion. Therefore, any feeling of disgust would be extremely subtle and far from a strong, visceral reaction."
landscape-with-red-spots-1913.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting by Wassily Kandinsky, characterized by its vibrant color palette and dynamic, non-representational forms, elicits no sensation of disgust. The emotion of disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, contamination, unpleasant bodily substances, or morally repugnant subject matter. This artwork presents none of these elements. The colors, while varied and sometimes clashing, are largely bright and energetic (reds, yellows, blues, oranges, purples) and do not mimic the muted, sickly, or putrid tones often linked to decay or unhygienic conditions. The forms are fluid, sometimes angular, and interweaving, but they are abstract and do not depict anything grotesque, offensive, or biologically repulsive. There is no suggestion of rot, grime, waste, injury, or anything that would activate a visceral response of revulsion or a desire to recoil. Instead, the painting's composition and use of color evoke a sense of movement, spiritual exploration, or musicality, which are entirely detached from any feeling of aversion or nausea."
komposition-1919.jpg,abstract,22.0,"The emotion of disgust, typically associated with revulsion towards something repulsive, offensive, or unclean, is only marginally present in this abstract work. The image is a maelstrom of fragmented shapes, sharp angles, and swirling patterns in stark black and white, creating an overwhelming sense of chaos and visual disarray. While there is nothing overtly depicted that would trigger a visceral, biological disgust (such as gore, decay, or filth), the sheer lack of harmony and the frenetic, almost aggressive fragmentation of forms could induce a *mild* aesthetic discomfort or aversion in some viewers. This discomfort might manifest as a very subtle form of disgust, stemming from the visual 'offensiveness' of such extreme disorder or the feeling of being visually assaulted by the chaotic composition. It's less about moral or physical repugnance and more about a sensory overload or dissonance that some might find profoundly unpleasant or 'repugnant' to their sense of visual order. The unsettling nature comes from the disorganization and fragmentation, rather than anything inherently vile, thus limiting the intensity of this emotion."
mi-care-acvatic-1967.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with feelings of revulsion, often triggered by something perceived as unclean, decaying, offensive, or visually grotesque. This abstract work, however, is composed of clean, precise geometric shapes and a palette of muted, sophisticated colors (pinks, greens, grays, black, white, with a touch of red). The forms are orderly and structured, presenting an intellectual exploration of space, dimension, and perspective rather than anything visceral or unsettling. There are no organic elements, no chaotic or messy textures, and no imagery that suggests decay, illness, or anything otherwise repulsive. The overall impression is one of calm, analytical composition, completely devoid of any stimuli that might provoke a feeling of revulsion or disgust."
modern-painting-with-clef-1967.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by elements that are perceived as repulsive, unclean, sickening, offensive, or morally objectionable. The artwork, a vibrant and geometric abstract composition by Roy Lichtenstein, features clean, bold lines, flat areas of saturated color (yellow, red, blue, olive green, black, white, and various shades of gray with Ben-Day dots), and highly organized shapes. There are no depictions of decay, bodily fluids, violence, suffering, filth, or anything that could be considered physically or morally repellent. The aesthetic is graphic, orderly, and almost clinical in its precision, deliberately avoiding any organic or visceral qualities that might provoke such a reaction. The composition is visually engaging and dynamic, but entirely devoid of any content or stylistic choices that would incite feelings of revulsion or aversion."
meditations-1970c.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The painting does not elicit a significant feeling of disgust. The color palette, while dominated by dark browns, grays, and muted reds and oranges, does not suggest decay, putrefaction, or anything overtly repulsive. The textures are rough and heavily impastoed, contributing to a sense of grittiness or raw materiality, but this is a stylistic choice rather than an intentional evocation of filth or unpleasantness. There are no recognizable forms or subjects that are typically associated with disgust, such as bodily fluids, waste, or morally repugnant scenes. While the overall mood might be somber or intense, there is nothing in the visual elements that triggers a strong visceral reaction of revulsion. The score of 1 reflects an almost complete absence of this emotion, acknowledging only the slightest, most abstract possibility that very rough, dark, and undefined textures *could* theoretically be interpreted by some as vaguely unkempt, a very distant association with the concept of disgust."
mask-4-1936.jpg,abstract,1.5,"The painting, with its abstract, biomorphic forms and muted color palette, does not evoke a significant sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are perceived as unhygienic, decaying, diseased, harmful, or morally repulsive. This artwork contains none of these elements. The shapes, while organic and somewhat ambiguous, are rendered cleanly with smooth transitions and rounded edges, lacking any textures (slimy, gritty, coarse) or visual cues (rotting, festering, contaminated) that would typically elicit a visceral reaction of revulsion. The colors, a mix of blues, reds, purples, browns, and off-whites, are deep and somewhat earthy, but none are inherently sickening or jarring in a way that would trigger disgust. While some might interpret the forms as internal organs, they are highly stylized and devoid of any context that would suggest injury, decay, or exposure in a grotesque manner. Any potential slight discomfort (hence not a perfect 0) would be extremely minimal and highly subjective, perhaps stemming from a very niche personal aversion to highly abstract organic forms, rather than a common or intended emotional response. Overall, the painting offers nothing offensive or repulsive to the senses."
miracles-of-evolution-africa-1977.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The color palette, predominantly vibrant greens and yellows with touches of blue, is associated with nature, growth, and vitality, not decay or unpleasantness. The subject matter, which appears to be an abstract or semi-abstract depiction of dense foliage or plant life, contains no elements that are inherently repulsive, unsanitary, or grotesque. There are no visual cues suggesting filth, rot, disease, or any other quality that would trigger a feeling of revulsion. The brushwork, while dynamic and fragmented, does not convey textures or forms that are slimy, sticky, or otherwise physically unsettling. The overall impression is one of lushness and organic vibrancy, which stands in direct opposition to any sensation of disgust."
nature-rhythms-1950.jpg,abstract,1.0,"The painting, an abstract composition dominated by curvilinear forms and a palette of browns, beiges, and subtle whites/light blues, offers no discernible elements that would provoke a sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by stimuli associated with decay, contamination, grotesque or unsanitary conditions, or moral revulsion. This artwork presents none of these. The colors are earthy and warm, evoking natural elements like soil, sand, or rock formations, which are generally perceived as neutral or comforting rather than repulsive. The shapes are organic and flowing, suggesting a dynamic, perhaps geological or biological, process, but without any hint of putrefaction, slime, or distortion that might induce revulsion. There are no identifiable figures, objects, or narrative content that could be interpreted as vile, offensive, or impure. The lines are clean, and the overall aesthetic is one of abstract harmony and movement, devoid of any visual cues that could be associated with unpleasant physical sensations or moral repugnance."
movement-sea-ultramarine-and-green-sky-cerulean-and-grey-1947.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There are absolutely no visual elements within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork utilizes a vibrant, expressive palette of blues, greens, and a striking red, against a neutral background. The brushwork is loose and gestural, typical of an abstract or semi-abstract style, and does not depict anything that could be interpreted as decaying, grotesque, vile, or unsanitary. There is no representation of bodily fluids, filth, gore, or any subject matter that is inherently repulsive or morally objectionable. The composition, while abstract, suggests a benign landscape or seascape with abstract forms, perhaps a boat or building and figures in water, none of which carry any negative connotations associated with disgust. The painting's aesthetic is one of energy and color, devoid of any disturbing or sickening imagery."
not-detected-4.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract composition evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The forms are clean, simplified, and geometric or biomorphic, devoid of any messy, grotesque, or unhygienic qualities. The color palette, while bold with stark contrasts of black, white, and red, includes no hues that suggest decay, illness, or putrefaction. There are no disturbing textures, unsettling narratives, or visceral elements that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion. The painting presents a very controlled and visually organized aesthetic, which is the antithesis of what typically incites disgust."

There are no elements within the composition that remotely suggest decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, disturbing subject matter, or moral depravity, all of which are common triggers for disgust. The lines are smooth and defined, the colors are neutral and appear unblemished, and the overall aesthetic is one of order and abstract design. There is nothing visually or conceptually repulsive about the artwork that would elicit any degree of revulsion or distaste. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is completely absent."
o32-60-1960.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting is an abstract composition featuring clean, geometric lines and a single circle set against a very light, almost white background. The color palette is extremely muted, consisting solely of a soft light blue/grey and the off-white ground. There are no discernable elements within the artwork that evoke any sensation of revulsion, repulsion, or distaste. The forms are non-representational, preventing any association with biological decay, filth, harm, or morally objectionable content typically associated with disgust. The precise lines and calm colors contribute to an overall impression of visual clarity and neutrality, making it impossible for the emotion of disgust to arise from observing this particular artwork."
movement-in-white-umber-and-cobalt-green-1950.png,abstract,0.5,"The painting presents an abstract composition dominated by muted tones of beige, light purple, white, and various shades of brown. Its structure consists of intersecting lines and fragmented, rectangular shapes, creating a sense of dynamic movement and deconstruction. When evaluating for disgust, typical triggers include elements of decay, filth, putrefaction, grotesque distortion, or subject matter that evokes moral revulsion. None of these elements are present in this work. The color palette is earthy and neutral, lacking any hues that might be associated with sickness or unpleasant biological processes. The forms are abstract and geometric, without any explicit depiction of bodily fluids, waste, or objects in a state of decay. While the fragmentation might imply a breaking down of forms, it does not translate into a visual representation of decay or physical deterioration in a repulsive sense. The brushstrokes are visible and textural, but do not suggest anything slimy, gritty, or otherwise viscerally unpleasant to the touch. There is no narrative or discernible subject matter that could provoke moral disgust. Therefore, the visual language of the painting offers virtually no points of contact with the typical triggers for this emotion, resulting in a score very close to absolute zero. The score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the infinitesimal possibility of an idiosyncratic and highly subjective negative aesthetic reaction in an individual, but fundamentally, the painting lacks any discernible quality that would commonly evoke disgust."
not_detected_189365.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting, with its vibrant and contrasting colors (red, yellow, green, blue, black), and energetic, fragmented brushstrokes, does not inherently evoke feelings of disgust. There is no clear subject matter that is typically associated with revulsion, such as decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything morally repugnant. The abstract forms and dynamic composition lean more towards a sense of vibrant chaos or an expression of energy rather than something unpleasant or offensive.

However, a very low score, rather than a perfect zero, is assigned due to the possibility that some individuals might experience a *mild* degree of sensory overload or discomfort from the intense clash of colors and the seemingly disorganized, jumbled forms, which *could* be interpreted by a small subset of viewers as visually 'unpleasant' or 'jarring' in a way that approaches a minor aesthetic aversion, a sensation that at its extreme could border on a very slight, almost imperceptible, visceral reaction for someone highly sensitive to visual discord. This is not disgust in the typical sense of revulsion towards something repulsive, but rather a very faint, almost negligible, aesthetic discomfort that might touch upon the fringes of mild aversion."
not_detected_189367.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, an abstract composition, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, grotesque, unclean, or indicative of decay, disease, or moral depravity. This artwork, however, presents clean lines, sharp geometric shapes, and a stark yet orderly arrangement of black, white, and a few primary colors (teal, red, blue, brown). There are no organic forms, no representations of bodily fluids, waste, grime, or anything physically unpleasant. The abstract forms and the structured environment of the striped ""room"" create a sense of design and analytical thought rather than anything that would induce revulsion or nausea.

Disgust is typically associated with things that are repulsive, grotesque, decaying, or dirty, often triggering a visceral reaction of revulsion or contamination. None of these elements are present in the artwork. The lines are clean and precise, the shapes are distinct and geometric (circles, squares, triangles, checkerboard patterns), and the color palette, while varied, consists of clear, non-muddied hues (red, orange, yellow, purple, black, grey, blue). There are no organic forms that could suggest decay or unpleasant textures. The overall impression is one of order and artistic exploration, completely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger a sensation of disgust."
niwiarki-1950.jpg,abstract,55.0,"The artwork evokes a moderate sense of disgust primarily through its depiction of distorted and unsettling forms. The most prominent elements contributing to this feeling are the gnarled, claw-like hands in the lower left and lower right sections of the composition. These hands appear withered, almost skeletal or diseased, with an unnatural configuration of fingers that suggests decay, extreme age, or physical malformation. This representation of corporeal distortion can trigger a subtle, visceral revulsion, as it deviates sharply from healthy, natural forms and touches upon themes of physical deterioration or unpleasant abnormality. Furthermore, the overall chaotic and abstract nature of the piece, with its swirling lines and shaded, shapeless masses, contributes to a general sense of disarray or ""unwholesomeness."" While not explicitly depicting gore or filth, the unsettling jumble of organic-like forms and the dark, smudged areas can abstractly hint at something unappealing or morbid, thereby reinforcing a generalized feeling of unease that borders on mild disgust. The monochromatic palette and sketchy quality, however, prevent the sensation of disgust from becoming overwhelming, as the lack of realistic detail or vivid color softens the direct impact of the potentially repulsive forms."
orange-violet-1935.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, characteristic of Wassily Kandinsky's abstract style, is composed of various geometric and organic shapes, vibrant and muted colors, and dynamic lines. There is absolutely nothing in the visual elements of this artwork that could evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, disease, or intentionally grotesque or offensive subject matter. This painting contains none of these elements. The forms are abstract and stylized, the colors are generally harmonious or provide dynamic contrasts, and the overall composition, while complex and energetic, does not suggest anything repulsive or vile. Even the serpentine-like figure in the central black rectangle is depicted in clean, stylized lines and colors (blue, purple, yellow) rather than in a way that would suggest sliminess, threat, or any other quality that might be associated with revulsion. The aesthetic is one of abstract exploration and visual harmony, not one designed to provoke a negative visceral reaction like disgust."
nova-aurigae-1918.jpg,abstract,10.0,"The artwork primarily evokes feelings of intensity, chaos, and perhaps anguish, rather than a strong sense of disgust. While the central face is highly stylized and distorted, appearing somewhat grotesque or monstrous, its depiction leans more towards expressing turbulent emotion or a fantastical entity rather than something physically repulsive, unclean, or decaying. The vibrant and energetic use of yellows, oranges, and reds, set against a dynamic blue background, creates an active and expressive scene that generally counters sensations of revulsion. There are no elements within the composition, such as explicit decay, filth, or bodily fluids, that would typically trigger a visceral feeling of disgust. The slight score for disgust comes solely from the abstract, unsettling distortion of the face, which, for some viewers, might marginally border on an aesthetic or mild visual distaste rather than true revulsion. However, this is not the dominant or intended emotional response."
painterly-architectonic-3.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric shapes and bold colors (blues, greens, black, white, and earthy reds/oranges), evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things that are offensive to the senses, such as foul odors, tastes, or sights (e.g., decay, waste, contamination, or gruesome imagery), or by morally repugnant actions. This artwork presents none of these characteristics. There are no recognizable objects that could be considered disgusting. The colors, while strong and contrasting, are not sickly, muddy, or reminiscent of anything putrid or unhygienic. The sharp, clean lines and angular forms do not suggest organic decay, bodily fluids, or any form of corruption. The texture appears to be typical of oil on canvas, without any tactile qualities that might induce revulsion. Its abstract nature removes any potential narrative or figurative elements that could provoke a moral or visceral sense of disgust. As such, the painting remains aesthetically interesting and visually dynamic, but entirely devoid of qualities that would elicit a response of revulsion. A score of 0.5 acknowledges the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association, but for the vast majority of viewers, disgust would not be an evoked emotion."
paesaggio-cosmico-1934.jpg,abstract,0.5,"This abstract painting presents no visual elements that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. The color palette, predominantly composed of deep blacks, vibrant blues, greens, and some luminous whites and yellows, is clean and aesthetically pleasing rather than sickly or putrid. The shapes, whether geometric lines, radiating forms, or the large amorphous black blob and the bottle-like cutout, are abstract and non-representational in a way that prevents association with anything contaminating, decaying, or unhygienic. There are no depictions of waste, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or any other subject matter commonly linked to revulsion. The technique appears smooth and deliberate, likely airbrush or spray paint, which lends a pristine, almost cosmic quality, far removed from anything gritty, slimy, or rotten. The overall impression is one of dynamic energy and abstract beauty, not discomfort or repulsion. A score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any visual input, no matter how neutral, might register a minuscule, almost imperceptible blip on a comprehensive emotional scale for *some* individual, but practically speaking, there is nothing in this artwork to trigger disgust."
painterly-architectonic.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric forms and vibrant colors, offers absolutely no visual cues or thematic content that would evoke disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by sensory input related to contamination, decay, bodily effluvia, or things that are perceived as threatening to one's physical integrity or moral sensibilities. This artwork consists of clean, sharp lines and distinct, flat planes of color (orange, yellow, white, black, various shades of blue and burgundy). There are no organic forms, textures suggestive of rot or unpleasant substances, nor any disturbing imagery. The overall impression is one of dynamic balance and aesthetic arrangement, not one that would elicit a visceral negative reaction of revulsion or repulsion."
paris-abstract.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this abstract painting that evokes a sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visuals associated with decay, filth, disease, grotesque imagery, or things that are inherently repulsive to our senses or moral sensibilities. This artwork features clean, vibrant colors (oranges, purples, yellows, greens) set against a deep black background, creating a visually dynamic and engaging composition. The shapes are abstract, a blend of geometric and organic forms that float and interact without suggesting anything biological, decaying, or unsanitary. There are no textures or color combinations that would be perceived as nauseating or repugnant. The overall aesthetic is one of modern design and harmonious balance, entirely devoid of any elements that would trigger an aversion response."
parque-de-s-paulo-1996.jpg,abstract,0.5,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The artwork features a vibrant and dynamic composition, characterized by clean lines, distinct geometric and organic shapes, and a bold, diverse color palette. The upper section, with its stylized blue and dark blue architectural forms against a white background, suggests a modern, almost futuristic cityscape, which is presented cleanly and without any elements of decay, grime, or unpleasantness. The lower section, filled with swirling, fluid shapes in a range of bright reds, yellows, greens, blues, and browns, conveys a sense of movement, energy, and artistic expression. There are no visual cues such as sickly colors, ambiguous textures, decaying matter, or grotesque forms that typically trigger a feeling of disgust. The overall aesthetic is one of abstract beauty and visual interest, entirely devoid of anything repulsive, contaminated, or unsanitary. The painting is aesthetically pleasing and visually stimulating, leaving no room for a reaction of revulsion or a desire to recoil."
peaky-forms-1923.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting, characterized by its vibrant color palette and dynamic, gestural brushstrokes, elicits no sensation of disgust whatsoever. The emotion of disgust is typically triggered by visual stimuli that are perceived as repulsive, unclean, rotten, grotesque, or morally offensive. Here, there are no recognizable forms or subjects that could be interpreted as unhygienic, decaying, or threatening in a way that would induce revulsion. The colors, including bright yellows, oranges, reds, blues, greens, purples, and browns, are lively and energetic, not sickly or clashing in a manner that would be unsettling to the viewer's stomach or sensibilities. The texture of the paint, while visible and expressive, does not suggest anything visceral or unpleasantly tactile. The overall impression of the artwork is one of abstract beauty and vibrant movement, completely devoid of any elements that might evoke a feeling of aversion or nausea."
pasture-1958.jpg,abstract,0.1,"My emotional response to this artwork registers an extremely low, almost negligible, level of disgust. The primary reason for this assessment is the complete absence of any visual elements typically associated with eliciting this emotion. The textile features an earthy palette, predominantly composed of various shades of green, with accents of black, white, and a muted reddish-orange. These colors are natural and harmonious, bearing no resemblance to decay, illness, or bodily fluids, which often trigger visceral disgust. Furthermore, the texture, while clearly woven and tactile, appears clean, orderly, and well-executed, offering no hint of sliminess, grubbiness, or unpleasant haptic qualities. The abstract patterns, made up of repetitive blocks, lines, and geometric forms, are organized and visually interesting, not chaotic or jarring in a way that would offend the senses or evoke a feeling of revulsion. There is no depicted subject matter, narrative, or symbolism that could be interpreted as morally repugnant, offensive, or otherwise instigate a feeling of aversion or nausea. The overall impression is one of craftsmanship, natural tones, and an abstract aesthetic, none of which carry any properties that would provoke disgust."
painting-on-light-ground-1916.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by Wassily Kandinsky's ""All Saints I."" This painting, characteristic of Kandinsky's transition towards abstraction and his focus on spiritual expression, does not employ visual elements typically associated with revulsion. There is no imagery of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or extreme physical suffering designed to elicit a visceral reaction of disgust. The color palette, while rich and varied, uses vibrant hues—reds, yellows, blues, greens, and warm browns—rather than sickly, muted, or putrid tones that might suggest decay or disease. The forms, though distorted and highly dynamic, appear more as symbolic representations of figures in a spiritual or emotional maelstrom rather than literally repulsive or decaying entities. While some viewers might find the swirling, abstracted forms and the intensity of the composition unsettling or chaotic, this sense of unease does not translate into genuine disgust. The distortions are an artistic language for conveying inner states and spiritual striving, not a deliberate attempt to portray anything physically offensive or morally reprehensible. Therefore, any sense of disgust is extremely marginal, perhaps stemming from a very general sense of aesthetic disorientation rather than a direct trigger of revulsion."
planos-de-color-con-dos-maderas-superpuestas-1928.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract composition, I find absolutely no elements within the painting that would elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by something offensive, repulsive, unhygienic, or morally abhorrent. This artwork, characterized by its clear geometric forms (rectangles, squares, and a central circle) and a palette of primary colors (red, blue, yellow) along with black and white, presents a highly organized and non-representational visual experience. There are no depictions of decay, bodily fluids, violence, or anything that could be considered unsanitary or grotesque. The texture, while visible and somewhat coarse due to the paint application and potential surface material (like wood panels, suggested by the central seam and small holes), conveys a sense of materiality and age, rather than grime or deterioration. The cleanliness of the color blocks and the intentional, structured arrangement of shapes preclude any sense of aesthetic or sensory repulsion. Therefore, the painting is entirely devoid of characteristics that would provoke disgust."
plumen-1957.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork is abstract, composed of dark, organic, blob-like shapes set against a segmented, colorful background of blue, purple, green, dark grey, and red/orange. There are no visual elements within this composition that elicit a feeling of disgust. The colors, while varied, are not sickly, unsettling, or reminiscent of decay or filth. The shapes are rounded and somewhat ambiguous, resembling pebbles, fruits, or amorphous forms, but they are not grotesque, malformed, or suggestive of anything repulsive. There is no discernible subject matter or narrative that could be interpreted as offensive, vile, or sickening, either physically or morally. The overall aesthetic is one of compositional balance and color interplay, completely devoid of any characteristics that would typically trigger revulsion."
pera-1986.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork presents an abstract, geometric composition characterized by clean lines, distinct shapes, and a vibrant color palette consisting primarily of deep blues, various shades of yellow and gold, complemented by touches of red, light blue, and pink. There are no elements within this visual field that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. The forms are non-representational or semi-representational, resembling architectural structures or machine components, devoid of any organic matter, decay, or bodily fluids. The colors are bright and well-defined, not murky, sickly, or associated with putrefaction. Furthermore, there is no narrative content, human figures, or implied actions that could evoke moral revulsion. Aesthetically, while abstract art can elicit a range of responses, this particular piece does not employ visual strategies (such as extreme dissonance, unsettling textures, or jarring ugliness) designed to provoke a sense of revulsion or aesthetic offense. Its complex yet structured appearance and clear visual language preclude any feeling of nausea or profound aversion. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing in this image that would incite disgust."
picture-with-a-black-arch-1912.jpg,abstract,0.1,"This painting, ""Composition VII"" by Wassily Kandinsky, is a prime example of abstract art, focusing on the interplay of color, form, and line to evoke emotions and spiritual sensations rather than depict recognizable objects or scenes. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by sensory input related to things that are perceived as unclean, decaying, repulsive, or inherently harmful (like spoiled food, bodily fluids, or grotesque imagery). This painting contains absolutely none of these elements. The colors are vibrant and varied (reds, greens, yellows, blues, browns), applied with an energetic and dynamic brushwork that suggests movement and harmony, not sickness or decay. The forms are fluid and abstract, lacking any discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as grotesque, putrid, or offensive. There are no textures that imply sliminess or grittiness in a repulsive way, nor are there any patterns or compositions that could induce a feeling of nausea or revulsion. The overall impression is one of visual energy and complex, non-representational beauty, completely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger a visceral response of disgust. The score is not an absolute zero only to allow for the extremely remote and idiosyncratic possibility of individual sensory aversion to certain color combinations or abstract forms, but from a general interpretive standpoint, there is nothing in this work designed or likely to evoke disgust."
red-and-blue-layers-1954.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely no discernible element within this image that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork is a vibrant, geometrically patterned textile featuring bold stripes and textured, circular motifs in shades of blue, orange, and pink. The colors are bright and clean, not muddy, sickly, or reminiscent of decay. The patterns are orderly and rhythmic, demonstrating clear design and craftsmanship, rather than chaos or unpleasant disarray. The texture appears tactile and intentionally varied, presenting as a rich surface rather than something slimy, putrid, or physically repulsive. There is no depiction of anything unsanitary, decomposed, violent, or morally objectionable. The overall impression is one of visual energy and well-executed design, which stands in direct opposition to any sensation of revulsion or aversion."
rencontre-sur-une-plage.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting presents no visual elements commonly associated with the emotion of disgust. The shapes, while non-representational, are clean and geometric, or smoothly organic, lacking any suggestion of decay, disease, bodily fluids, or anything unhygienic or putrid. The color palette, composed of earthy browns, blues, whites, purples, and greens, is generally harmonious and does not contain hues typically linked to repulsive substances. There is no texture that appears slimy, sticky, or otherwise physically off-putting. Furthermore, the subject matter, being abstract, avoids any depiction of morally repugnant acts or grotesque figures that might induce revulsion. The overall impression is one of formal composition and color interaction, rather than anything that would trigger a sensory or moral feeling of disgust."
presence-of-a-memory.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting evokes an extremely low degree of disgust. There are virtually no visual elements typically associated with this emotion, such as visceral organic forms, explicit depictions of bodily fluids, rot, or decay in a nauseating manner. The color palette, dominated by muted browns, dark blues, blacks, and greys, is somber and perhaps melancholic, but not sickening or putrid. The forms are largely abstract, geometric, and somewhat industrial or architectural, lacking any grotesque or repulsive qualities.

However, a very slight, almost negligible sense of aversion might be conceptually linked to certain textures. Specifically, the rough, eroded, and somewhat pitted texture on the greyish, columnar element on the left side of the canvas could abstractly suggest deterioration or corrosion. While this is far from a direct trigger for visceral disgust, the concept of something decaying or being worn down, even in an abstract artistic context, can carry a faint echo of unpleasantness or unhealthiness. This is a very subtle conceptual link rather than an immediate sensory one, and it does not manifest as a strong feeling of revulsion or nausea. The overall impression is more one of contemplation or mystery than a feeling of being repulsed."
selam-trilogy.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting does not elicit any discernible feelings of disgust. There are no elements within the artwork – such as depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, disease, or morally repugnant acts – that typically trigger this emotion. The abstract, fragmented style, while perhaps evoking a sense of solemnity or introspection, is not grotesque or visually offensive in a manner that would induce revulsion. The color palette, dominated by dark tones and warm highlights, is aesthetically controlled, and the overall composition presents a structured, almost monumental quality, rather than anything chaotic or repulsive. The slight non-zero score acknowledges the subjective nature of emotional response and the remote possibility of an idiosyncratic association, but fundamentally, the artwork contains no visual cues intended to or likely to provoke disgust."
runner-1934.jpg,abstract,2.5,"The emotion of disgust is barely, if at all, evoked by this abstract painting. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are offensive, repulsive, decaying, unhygienic, or morally repugnant. This artwork, however, presents a composition of abstract, organic black shapes set against an earthy, textured background of warm ochre and brown tones. There is nothing in the visual vocabulary—the forms, colors, or implied textures—that directly corresponds to triggers of disgust. The shapes are flowing and somewhat amorphous, resembling natural elements like smoke, liquid, or stylized figures, none of which inherently provoke a feeling of revulsion. The color palette is earthy and subdued, contributing to a sense of solemnity or contemplation rather than nausea or repulsion. There are no grotesque depictions, no suggestions of decay or uncleanliness, and no narrative elements that would imply something morally objectionable. Any minute fractional score (like 2.5) would be solely due to the potential for a highly subjective and idiosyncratic interpretation of an abstract form that might, to an extremely rare individual, vaguely resemble something unpleasant, but this is not an intended or common response. Therefore, the painting is largely devoid of any visual cues that would elicit disgust."
small-pleasures-1913.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, ""Composition VI"" by Wassily Kandinsky, is a seminal work of abstract art, characterized by its vibrant colors, dynamic lines, and energetic forms. There are no visual elements within the composition that would elicit a feeling of disgust. The color palette, while rich and complex with oranges, yellows, reds, blues, and browns, does not feature hues typically associated with decay, illness, or putrefaction (e.g., sickly greens, muddy browns in a negative, visceral sense). The forms are abstract and fluid, suggesting movement, chaos, or perhaps a spiritual upheaval, but they do not represent anything grotesque, filthy, or viscerally offensive. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, waste, contamination, or any subject matter that would typically trigger a revulsion response. The overall impression is one of intense visual and emotional energy, abstract expression, and perhaps even a sense of the sublime or chaotic, but entirely devoid of any cues that provoke disgust."
spiral-motif-in-white-black-and-indigo-1951.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, an abstract composition of swirling and horizontal lines in earthy tones of brown, white, and blue, does not contain any visual elements that would typically elicit a sensation of disgust. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or anything that is visually repulsive, putrid, or morally offensive. The textures, while visible and somewhat coarse, are characteristic of the medium and do not suggest anything vile or sickening to the touch or sight. The dynamic lines and cool color palette create a sense of movement and natural patterns (like water or wood grain) rather than anything that would trigger aversion or revulsion. Therefore, there is absolutely no emotional response of disgust provoked by this artwork."
small-table-upper-surface-1920.jpg,abstract,2.0,"My assessment indicates a very low level of disgust in response to this painting. The primary reason for this minimal rating is the absence of any visual cues typically associated with this emotion. Disgust is often triggered by elements that suggest decay, contamination, filth, bodily fluids, rot, or unsanitary conditions. This abstract artwork, however, presents none of these. The colors, while diverse, include warm reds, oranges, and earthy tones alongside whites and greens, none of which inherently evoke sickness, putrefaction, or an unpleasant sense of decay. The shapes are organic and flowing, almost biomorphic, but they are rendered cleanly and do not appear distorted, diseased, or in any state of decomposition. There is no implied texture that suggests Sliminess, grittiness, or anything viscerally repulsive. The overall composition feels playful, decorative, and harmonious rather than chaotic, unsettling, or vile, thus providing no foundation for a feeling of revulsion."
rebuilding-the-tower-2009.jpg,abstract,7.5,"The painting evokes a very minimal sense of disgust, primarily stemming from the textural qualities and the muted, earthy color palette. The beige/off-white areas, particularly the large bottom shape and the central rectangle, possess a rough, somewhat mottled, and gritty texture that could be interpreted as a soiled, neglected, or decaying surface, akin to old, weathered stone, grimy concrete, or even a hardened, desiccated organic mass. The irregular speckling and streaking on these surfaces vaguely suggest a lack of cleanliness or a state of deterioration, which can subtly trigger a mild feeling of aversion related to grime or decay. Similarly, the deep, somber red/maroon background, while abstract, could be associated with dried elements or a somber, perhaps unhealthy, environment. However, these are extremely subtle and indirect triggers. The abstract nature of the forms prevents any direct association with common disgust-inducing stimuli such as bodily fluids, putrefaction, disease, or explicit filth. There is no visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea. Any sensation of disgust is extremely faint, operating more on a conceptual level of 'worn' or 'unclean' rather than a true sensory offense."
sea-1959.jpg,abstract,12.5,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this painting. The lower half of the artwork, characterized by its murky, dark palette dominated by deep blues, browns, and somber greens, features heavily textured, almost viscous or sludgy brushstrokes. The forms in this section are amorphous and indistinct, potentially suggesting decaying organic matter, disturbed earth, or an unpleasant, stagnant environment. This visual ambiguity, combined with the muddled and somewhat unwholesome coloration, can trigger a very faint, aesthetic sense of revulsion, akin to encountering something damp, soiled, or unclean in a natural setting. The texture itself, with its clotted appearance in places, contributes a mild tactile suggestion of something unappealing. However, the painting is abstract and does not depict anything explicitly repulsive, such as bodily fluids, gore, or clearly identifiable putrefaction. The overall effect is more one of subtle unease or mild unpleasantness rather than a strong, visceral feeling of disgust. The upper and middle sections, with their more orderly grids and vibrant, cleanly presented color blocks, offer no contribution to this emotion and, in fact, provide a visual counterpoint that reduces the overall potential for disgust."
study-for-improvisation-8-1909.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting, ""Improvisation 28 (second version)"" by Wassily Kandinsky, is a prime example of abstract expressionism. It is characterized by its vibrant, non-representational use of color and dynamic, flowing lines. The colors are bright and varied – yellows, oranges, greens, blues, reds – and are used in a way that evokes energy and movement, rather than any sense of decay, contamination, or unhealthiness. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, waste, decomposition, or anything that would typically trigger physical disgust. Furthermore, there are no narrative elements that suggest moral transgressions, cruelty, or any other subject matter that could elicit moral disgust. While abstract art can sometimes be challenging or unsettling to some viewers, there is nothing inherently repulsive or aesthetically offensive in a way that would induce disgust. The forms are fluid and energetic, and the overall impression is one of spiritual or emotional intensity, completely devoid of characteristics associated with the emotion of disgust."

There is no imagery suggestive of decay, contamination, filth, bodily fluids, gore, disease, or any other common visual triggers for disgust. The overall aesthetic is one of deliberate design and visual exploration, devoid of any elements that are inherently unpleasant, sickening, or morally reprehensible.

There are no representational forms that could be interpreted as grotesque, decaying, or unsanitary. The colors are earthy and subdued, lacking any combination or saturation that might be perceived as sickly or unsettling. The textures, while visible as brushwork, are not coarse or slimy in a manner that would induce a visceral sense of revulsion. Furthermore, the composition is an intellectual exercise in form and balance, presenting an ordered, albeit dynamic, arrangement of abstract elements rather than a chaotic or disturbing scene. There is no narrative content or thematic suggestion that could be construed as morally repugnant. The overall impression is one of contemplative abstraction, entirely devoid of the sensory or conceptual triggers for disgust."
tapestry-1948.jpg,abstract,0.1,"This artwork, an abstract textile piece, presents no visual elements that typically evoke disgust. The colors are muted earth tones (black, various browns, off-white), which are natural and common in many forms of art and textiles and do not carry negative connotations. The pattern is a geometric arrangement of woven lines, creating a textured surface. There is nothing in the form, composition, or apparent subject matter (as it is abstract) that suggests decay, illness, contamination, waste, physical repulsion, or moral offense. The texture appears to be that of a coarse, natural fiber, which is tactile but not inherently disgusting. The overall impression is one of visual interest through texture and pattern, rather than any form of revulsion or aversion. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is virtually absent."

tennis-1933.jpg,abstract,3.5,"The painting largely avoids elements that typically elicit disgust. There is no depiction of decay, gore, bodily fluids, explicit violence, or morally repugnant acts. The color palette, consisting of earthy tones, blacks, whites, and grays, is not sickly or putrid. The forms are biomorphic and abstract, somewhat resembling distorted human figures or internal organs, particularly the prominent white shape in the center. While these shapes are organic and somewhat unsettling in their fluidity and lack of defined structure, they are rendered cleanly and stylistically, appearing almost sculptural rather than visceral or repulsive. They lack any suggestion of illness, putrefaction, or unsanitary conditions. The textured background, reminiscent of sand or rough plaster, might evoke a slight sense of grittiness or barrenness, but it is not inherently disgusting like filth, slime, or mold. Any sense of unease or discomfort derived from the artwork stems more from its surreal and ambiguous nature than from anything truly repulsive. Therefore, the feeling of disgust, which typically involves a strong aversion to something perceived as unclean, harmful, or morally offensive, is minimally present."

The forms are geometric, sharp, and structured, lacking any organic, fluid, or chaotic elements that might be associated with unpleasantness. The checkered patterns, while visually active, are orderly and repetitive, not suggestive of anything vile or unhygienic. There are no disturbing figures, unsettling textures, or chromatic choices that would induce a sense of nausea or revulsion. The overall impression is one of intellectual engagement with form and balance, rather than visceral reaction.

the-last-judgment-1912.jpg,abstract,5.0,"Wassily Kandinsky's ""The Last Judgment, 1912"" is a prime example of abstract expressionism, characterized by its vibrant color palette, dynamic lines, and non-representational forms. When evaluating disgust, one looks for elements that might evoke a sense of revulsion, a visceral reaction to something perceived as unclean, decaying, grotesque, or morally offensive. In this artwork, such elements are conspicuously absent. The colors—bright yellows, energetic oranges, deep blues, and bold reds—are expressive and lively, rather than sickly, putrid, or indicative of decay. There are no mud-like browns, gangrenous greens, or unsettling ochres that might commonly be associated with repulsive substances. Furthermore, the forms are abstract, composed of swirling lines, organic blobs, and energetic strokes, none of which depict anything inherently disgusting like bodily fluids, waste, decomposition, or grotesque figures. While the composition is chaotic and intense, reflecting the dramatic theme of ""The Last Judgment,"" this chaos evokes a sense of spiritual or cosmic upheaval and dynamism, not a physical repulsion. The energy is one of explosive creation or transformation, not one of putrefaction or impurity. There's no narrative element or visual cue that suggests something foul, unhygienic, or morally abhorrent. The lines, though sometimes thick and dark, serve to define movement and form rather than to delineate anything grotesque. The overall impression is one of vibrant movement and raw emotional expression through color and form, far removed from any sensation of disgust. The score is a very low 5, acknowledging that extreme subjective interpretation could perhaps find chaos mildly unsettling, but not truly disgusting in any conventional sense."
the-letter-scale-1923.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting, characterized by its abstract and geometric forms, offers virtually no visual cues that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. The color palette, dominated by a reddish-brown background, features clean and well-defined applications of white, black, red, grey, and light blue/green. These colors are not muddy, sickly, or suggestive of decay or contamination. The forms themselves are precise, sharp-edged, and orderly, avoiding any organic messiness or grotesque distortion that might trigger revulsion. There are no depicted elements of filth, bodily waste, disease, putrefaction, or any visually offensive or repulsive subject matter. The stylized bird-like figure, while abstract, is rendered with elegant lines and a sense of purity rather than any unsettling or unhygienic qualities. The overall aesthetic leans towards a sense of design, order, and perhaps industrial precision, which are antithetical to the triggers for disgust. The painting engages the viewer on an aesthetic and intellectual level rather than provoking a visceral negative emotional response like revulsion. The score is a negligible 0.5 to acknowledge the subjective nature of emotional response, but fundamentally, there is nothing within the artwork's visual language that aligns with the sensation of disgust."
the-alibi-allotrope-1970.jpg,abstract,12.5,"The painting evokes a very minimal degree of disgust. There are no explicit visual elements typically associated with this emotion, such as clear depictions of decay, bodily fluids, filth, or overt grotesque deformities. The dominant color palette consists of muted greens, grays, and blacks, which do not inherently trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. While the abstract forms are ambiguous, and some viewers might interpret certain shapes as vaguely organic, skeletal, or distorted, their stylized and fragmented presentation prevents a strong, immediate feeling of revulsion or a sense of putrefaction. There is no suggestion of contamination or active repulsion. Any potential for disgust is extremely subtle and indirect, possibly arising from a highly subjective and intellectual interpretation of underlying disquieting or morbid themes rather than a direct, sensory experience of the repulsive. The artwork's primary effect leans more towards an atmosphere of somberness or structural tension rather than a pronounced feeling of physical aversion."
the-sculptor-1923.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, an abstract composition of geometric shapes, lines, and textured planes, contains no visual elements that would evoke the emotion of disgust. There is no representation of bodily fluids, decay, contamination, or any subject matter typically associated with revulsion. The colors, while varied, are not jarring or unappetizing. The textures depicted, such as the grainy surfaces, are not visceral or repellent. The forms are abstract and stylized, lacking any grotesque distortion or unpleasantness that might trigger a feeling of nausea or strong aversion. The overall impression is one of formal arrangement and color interaction, entirely devoid of characteristics that would incite disgust."
the-snail-1953.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This artwork, a vibrant and abstract composition of paper cut-outs by Henri Matisse, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The feeling of disgust is typically triggered by something offensive, repulsive, unhygienic, grotesque, or morally repugnant. None of these qualities are present in ""The Snail"" (or ""Memory of Oceania,"" depending on the interpretation, but the common name for this specific one is often ""The Snail"" or simply ""Composition"").

The image consists of brightly colored, irregularly shaped forms – primarily rectangles, squares, and organic curves – arranged on a white background with an orange border. The colors used (purple, magenta, black, various greens, orange, red, yellow, blue) are generally pleasing and harmonious, not clashing in a way that would be visually jarring or create a sense of unease that could escalate to disgust. The cut-out technique itself, while showing the intentional imperfections of hand-cut paper, does not convey messiness, decay, or any sense of something being ""off"" or dirty. Instead, it contributes to the artwork's playful and spontaneous character.

There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as disturbing or unpleasant; it is pure abstraction. The overall impression is one of energy, balance, and visual delight. Therefore, based on the visual elements, composition, color palette, and abstract nature, there is nothing within this artwork that would reasonably induce a feeling of disgust."
the-western-wall.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The artwork presents a vibrant and abstract, yet harmonious, depiction of what appears to be a cityscape under a night sky. The colors are rich and varied—blues, greens, pinks, purples, and oranges—creating a visually stimulating and generally pleasing palette. The forms, though abstract, suggest a lively collection of structures, possibly houses, with intricate patterns adding interest. There are no elements that are dirty, grotesque, decaying, or offensive in any way. The texture from the brushstrokes adds depth and character, rather than suggesting unpleasantness. The serene moon and stars in the night sky contribute to a calming or whimsical atmosphere. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, contaminated, or visually abhorrent, none of which are present in this aesthetically pleasing and imaginative composition."
the-yellow-curtain.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting, characterized by its vibrant colors—predominantly a bright yellow, various blues, and greens, with touches of red—and fluid, organic shapes, presents no visual stimuli that would evoke disgust. There are no depicted elements suggesting decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, or any form of physical or moral corruption. The colors are clean and bright, and the overall composition is one of balance and aesthetic appeal rather than anything unsettling or repulsive. The absence of representational content that could be interpreted as unpleasant, combined with the harmonious and abstract nature of the forms, means there is absolutely nothing within this artwork to trigger a feeling of aversion or revulsion."
the-wave-1950.jpg,abstract,0.5,"As an art expert evaluating this piece solely through the lens of disgust, I find virtually no elements present that would elicit such a response. Disgust is typically evoked by visual cues of decay, filth, illness, contamination, or morally reprehensible subjects. This artwork, however, is an abstract composition predominantly featuring swirling, wave-like patterns rendered in various shades of blue, gray, white, and earthy browns. These patterns evoke natural phenomena such as water currents, wind patterns, or perhaps cloud formations. The color palette is muted and organic, lacking any tones that might suggest putrefaction, unhealthiness, or grime. While there is a slight sense of a raw or perhaps unfinished quality to the artwork, with visible brushstrokes and what appears to be a grid overlay and some smudges (like the small dark spot on the left), these details do not translate into a feeling of repulsion. They are rather indicative of artistic process or material characteristics, not something inherently vile or offensive to the senses. There is nothing in the form, content, or execution that suggests anything rotten, unsanitary, grotesque, or morally objectionable. The overall impression is one of dynamic natural flow, rather than anything that would trigger an aversion response. The score of 0.5 acknowledges the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic, almost imperceptible flicker of unease from the very subtle ruggedness of the surface or a stray mark for some viewers, but it is effectively negligible and certainly not representative of true disgust."
title-sekere-visual-artist-ayibiowu-olusola-e-david-medium-oil-on-canvas-year-2004-1.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork utilizes a vibrant and luminous color palette, predominantly featuring bright yellows, oranges, and various shades of blue. These colors are inherently cheerful and energetic, far removed from the dull, murky, or sickly hues often associated with things that cause revulsion. The subject matter depicts three stylized figures, seemingly engaged in a ritualistic or communal act, holding what appear to be glowing orbs or stylized representations of corn cobs. These elements are rendered in an abstract and idealized manner, with no hints of decay, rot, disease, waste, or any physical or moral defilement. The figures themselves are depicted with clean lines and a sense of grace, lacking any grotesque features or disturbing expressions. The overall composition is dynamic and harmonious, conveying a sense of light, movement, and perhaps spiritual or communal connection, rather than anything chaotic, disturbing, or repulsive. There are no textures that suggest grime or decay, nor any implied narratives that would trigger aversion. The painting is visually pleasing and uplifting, directly opposing any sensation of disgust."
thursday-jeudi.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, with its abstract forms and deep blue, yellow, and white color palette, contains no visual elements typically associated with eliciting disgust. There is no depiction of decay, contamination, bodily fluids, grotesque physical deformities, or any imagery that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The stylized figures and shapes are abstract and enigmatic, creating a sense of mystery or contemplation rather than nausea or repulsion. The colors are harmonious and evocative, but not disturbing or offensive. Therefore, based purely on an analysis of elements that could trigger disgust, this artwork evokes absolutely none of that emotion."
totem.png,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are repulsive, offensive, unclean, decaying, grotesque, or morally objectionable. The artwork features a vibrant and bold palette of blues, reds, purples, white, yellow, and green. These colors are generally appealing and do not suggest anything putrid, sickly, or decaying. The forms are abstract or highly stylized, lacking any specific details that could be interpreted as gruesome, unhygienic, or physically repulsive. There are no unsettling textures, no depiction of violence, filth, disease, or any subject matter that would typically elicit a sensation of revulsion. The overall impression is one of abstract expression and color interaction, rather than anything negative or sickening. Therefore, disgust is entirely absent from the emotional response to this piece."
tuesday-mardi.jpg,abstract,0.1,"The painting, an abstract or highly stylized depiction featuring white, curved forms and a central shape with minor yellow and orange accents against a brown background, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, offensive, vile, or associated with decay, filth, or the grotesque. This artwork presents none of these characteristics. The forms are clean, almost floral or symbolic, and the colors, while earthy, are not jarring or indicative of anything unwholesome. There are no depictions of bodily fluids, rot, unpleasant textures, or disturbing imagery that would induce revulsion or a feeling of nausea. The aesthetic is more decorative or symbolic, rather than viscerally unsettling. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is almost entirely absent."
the-vertebrate-grotto-transfer-series.jpg,abstract,38.5,"The primary elements contributing to a sense of disgust stem from the strong suggestion of organic decay and unsettling biological forms. The prominent white shape at the bottom bears a striking resemblance to a human skull, particularly with its large, dark, empty ocular cavities. The association of skulls with death and decomposition naturally carries a subtle undertone of revulsion for some. Above this skull-like form, the vibrant pink and magenta elements, with their intricate, vein-like or dendritic patterns, strongly evoke images of internal organs, brain matter, or possibly morbid growths like fungi or diseased tissue. The fluid, almost 'melted' appearance of the white substance, especially as it trails downwards, reinforces the notion of decomposition or a breaking down of matter. These visual cues – a decaying skeletal structure combined with what appears to be deteriorating or diseased internal organic matter – tap into primal feelings of unease and mild repulsion associated with mortality and the grotesque. However, the abstract nature of the work, the artistic rendering, and the somewhat vibrant, almost beautiful, quality of the pink hues prevent it from eliciting extreme or visceral revulsion. It's a subtle, intellectual disgust, derived from the unsettling subject matter rather than overt gore or filth."
the-vertebrated-cavern-series-of-decals.jpg,abstract,40.0,"The image elicits a measurable, though not overwhelming, sense of disgust primarily through its suggestive forms and textures relating to biological decay and visceral matter. The prominent white shape in the center resembles a deconstructed or skeletal torso, possibly a ribcage or an exposed internal cavity, with hollowed-out areas that can be interpreted as empty sockets or points of deterioration. The texture of this white paint itself, characterized by streaky, congealed, and somewhat desiccated patterns, evokes the appearance of dried bodily fluids, pus, or calcified remnants, contributing to an unsettling feeling. Dark, murky splotches within this white form further suggest decay or contamination. Above, the floating pink shapes, while abstract, can be interpreted as disembodied organs, fleshy growths, or diseased tissue, especially given their somewhat irregular and fragmented forms. The green elements, while potentially natural, within this context, could be perceived as mold or parasitic growths, adding to the theme of biological corruption. The overall aesthetic leans towards the grotesque and the abject, hinting at processes of decomposition, internal decay, or unhealthy biological states, which triggers a subtle but persistent sense of revulsion. However, the abstract nature and artistic rendering prevent a direct, strong visceral reaction often associated with overt disgust (e.g., rotten food or explicit gore), positioning the feeling in the lower-to-moderate range."
unknown-title-14.jpg,abstract,5.0,"The painting, an abstract composition, does not contain any visual elements that typically evoke a feeling of disgust. The color palette consists primarily of muted tones—browns, greys, and off-whites—which are somber but not inherently repulsive. The forms are organic and somewhat ambiguous, resembling abstract figures or natural elements, but they are not grotesque, distorted, or suggestive of decay, contamination, or anything visceral that would trigger revulsion. The textures, particularly the rough, almost fibrous appearance at the top and the grass-like strands at the bottom, are visual textures that do not inherently convey unpleasantness or filth. There is no narrative or symbolic content that hints at moral disgust or anything loathsome. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation or perhaps a subdued mood, rather than any form of repulsion. A very low score is assigned because while it does not actively *induce* disgust, an extremely negligible trace might be perceived by some if they found the forms vaguely unsettling or the muted colors slightly sickly, but this is a highly subjective and minor interpretation not strongly supported by the artwork itself."
underground-metaphysical-landscape-c-1960-4.jpg,abstract,2.0,"The painting is an abstract composition, and as such, it lacks any direct representational elements that might typically evoke disgust, such as bodily fluids, decaying matter, gore, or unsanitary conditions. The shapes are non-objective, and while some colors like deep reds, dark browns, and murky greens are present, they are part of a broader palette that also includes bright yellows and lighter tones. These colors, even in their darker shades, do not inherently trigger a sense of revulsion or nausea. The texture of the paint, visible through the brushstrokes, appears somewhat impasto in areas, but it does not convey anything slimy, sticky, or otherwise physically repulsive. There is a general lack of identifiable forms or narratives that could lead to a feeling of disgust; the emotion simply does not align with the visual information presented in this abstract work. Any extremely low score would be negligible, but a 2 accounts for the theoretical possibility that some highly subjective, idiosyncratic response to certain color combinations or undefined textures might lean towards mild aversion in a tiny fraction of viewers, though this is not a common or intended interpretation."
unknown-title-16.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The artwork presents a composition of abstract, rounded, and somewhat biomorphic forms floating above what appears to be a reflective surface, with two distinct color blocks below. There is nothing in the visual elements of this painting that remotely triggers a feeling of disgust. The shapes are clean and stylized, not depicting anything bodily, decaying, or unclean. The color palette, while varied, consists of muted earth tones, soft whites, and a touch of red and blue, none of which are inherently nauseating or repulsive. The textures appear to be either smooth or subtly grainy, not evoking anything visceral or putrid. There is no narrative content or implied subject matter that would incite moral or physical aversion. The overall aesthetic is one of abstract balance and contemplation rather than anything that would cause repulsion or offense. A score of 0.5 is given to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic and highly personal negative visceral reaction to any visual stimulus, but practically, the painting offers no cues for disgust."
topological-contortion-of-a-female-figure-becoming-a-violoncello.jpg,abstract,18.0,"The painting evokes a subtle, rather than visceral, sense of disgust primarily through its distorted and deconstructed biomorphic forms. These forms strongly resemble human or animal anatomy, such as pelvic bones, ribs, and internal structures, but are presented in an abstracted, almost mechanical, and unsettlingly intertwined manner. This deconstruction of familiar bodily forms can trigger a mild sense of the uncanny or the grotesque, touching upon a primal aversion to the body's integrity being violated or presented in an unnatural state. Specifically, the smooth yet unsettlingly organic protrusions, such as the nipple-like forms observed on the central structure, create a slightly repellent juxtaposition when placed on what appears to be a bone or machine-like framework. While there is no explicit depiction of decay, contamination, or gore, the psychological discomfort derived from seeing the body's internal or skeletal elements warped and exposed in such a manner can elicit a low-level, intellectualized feeling of revulsion or unease. The overall aesthetic is one of macabre elegance rather than overt unpleasantness, thus limiting the intensity of this emotion."
unstable-compositions-1967.jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this abstract painting that evokes a sense of disgust. The artwork consists of geometric shapes rendered in various shades of blue, grey, and dark purple against a dark, seemingly black, background. Disgust is typically triggered by imagery that is repulsive, vile, sickening, or morally objectionable – such as decay, filth, gore, or scenes of extreme cruelty. This painting, however, presents a clean, abstract composition of angular forms and cool, harmonious colors. There are no organic forms, textures, or narratives that could be interpreted as unhygienic, grotesque, or offensive. The aesthetic is purely formal, focusing on lines, shapes, and color interplay, none of which carry any inherent capacity to provoke revulsion. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate, as there is no discernible element within the artwork that contributes to the emotion of disgust."
unknown-title-5.jpg,abstract,0.1,"My assessment finds virtually no elements within this abstract painting that would evoke a sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by a feeling of revulsion or strong aversion, often stemming from something perceived as offensive, unclean, decaying, or morally repugnant. This artwork presents a harmonious arrangement of abstract forms, primarily in warm and earthy tones—yellows, creams, oranges, browns, and a striking red. The shapes are a mix of geometric (semicircles, rectangles) and organic, featuring varied textures. There is no discernible subject matter that is inherently repulsive, nor are there any grotesque, unsanitary, or morally offensive depictions. The colors are vibrant and balanced, not sickly or clashing in a way that would be aesthetically jarring to the point of revulsion. The textures, while present, do not suggest decay or unpleasantness; rather, they add visual interest. Overall, the composition is visually engaging and appears well-executed, offering nothing that triggers a visceral reaction of repulsion or an intellectual sense of contempt. The emotion of disgust is entirely absent from my response to this piece."
twins.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract or semi-abstract black and white drawing, primarily presents a complex arrangement of angular and interlocking forms. There are no elements within the visual composition that typically trigger a sensation of disgust, such as depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, disease, or any morally repugnant acts. The lines are clean, the hatching is precise, and the overall impression is one of structured complexity rather than organic decay or repulsive disorder.

While the sharp, jagged forms in the center might evoke a sense of unease or tension due to their fragmented appearance, this feeling is distinctly separate from disgust. There is nothing in the imagery that suggests contamination, putrefaction, or anything inherently sickening or vile that would provoke a visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea. The abstract nature of the piece tends to engage intellectual interpretation rather than primal emotional responses like disgust.

A very low, almost negligible score is given to account for the extreme subjectivity of artistic interpretation, where a viewer might, through a highly abstract associative leap, connect the harshness or fragmentation of the forms to a very faint, personal sense of visual discomfort that could be tangentially related to aversion. However, this is not a common or direct evocation of disgust by the artwork itself, which lacks any concrete triggers for this emotion."
untitled-1.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting, composed of clean geometric shapes and blocks of solid, vibrant colors against a dark background, elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. The visual elements are purely formal: triangles, circles, and rectangular prisms are arranged in a non-representational manner. There are no organic forms, textures, or implied narratives that could suggest decay, uncleanliness, physical repulsiveness, or moral corruption—all common triggers for the emotion of disgust. The colors are clear and distinct, and while the composition is abstract, it does not present any jarring or unsettling visual dissonances that might lead to an aesthetic form of revulsion. The overall impression is one of order and design, rather than anything chaotic, messy, or offensive to the senses. As such, the painting remains entirely neutral in its capacity to provoke disgust."
unknown-title.jpeg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract composition purely through the lens of disgust, I find no discernible elements within the artwork that elicit such a response. The painting employs a muted, earthy palette of whites, beige, soft yellows, and deep brown/black, colors that are generally neutral or even calming, and do not resemble anything decaying, putrid, or otherwise vile. The textures, while somewhat diffused and feathery, evoke a sense of softness or atmospheric blending rather than grime, mold, or an unsanitary condition. There are no grotesque forms, no explicit depictions of decay, bodily fluids, waste, or any imagery commonly associated with contamination or disease that would trigger a visceral feeling of revulsion. The composition is balanced and orderly, featuring clear, intersecting lines that create a sense of structure rather than chaos or disruption. The overall aesthetic is one of meditative abstraction, devoid of any visual cues that would provoke a sensation of nausea, aversion, or moral repugnance. Therefore, the painting registers absolutely no feeling of disgust."
tumblr-n1ldo3sjum1tur0p6o3-r1-500.jpg,abstract,3.5,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this painting, registering an extremely low score. There are no explicit depictions of decay, gore, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or grotesque figures that typically trigger a strong sense of revulsion. The color palette, composed mainly of earthy tones, muted purples, and deep reds, does not inherently suggest putrefaction or contamination. The textures are abstract patterns, not overtly slimy, viscous, or putrid. However, a very faint and subjective sense of discomfort, which could marginally brush against the lower end of the disgust spectrum, might arise from the painting's highly abstract and dense composition. Some viewers might interpret the jumbled, overlapping organic forms as vaguely reminiscent of internal organs or unidentifiable, ambiguous biological matter when abstracted, or perhaps sense a subtle 'busyness' and lack of clear definition that could be perceived as slightly unsettling rather than aesthetically pleasing. For instance, certain rounded, textured shapes or the small, spiky, dark form on the right might, for a highly sensitive individual, abstractly evoke an extremely minor aversion akin to encountering an ambiguous, foreign biological specimen. This is not to suggest the painting is fundamentally disgusting, but rather that its abstract nature leaves a very small margin for individual interpretation of unpleasant organic ambiguity, far from a strong, visceral, or intended feeling of disgust."
untitled-1913.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, with its vibrant colors, geometric forms, and abstract yet structured composition, offers no visual cues that would evoke a sensation of disgust. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or any other subject matter conventionally associated with revulsion. The patterns, such as the white dots on the green and orange surfaces, are purely decorative and do not suggest anything unsanitary or repulsive. The color palette, though diverse, is harmonious and stimulating rather than jarring or sickly. The overall aesthetic is one of artistic exploration and design, devoid of any elements that would trigger an instinctual or visceral feeling of aversion or nausea."

The lines are precise, the colors are aesthetically pleasing and calming, and there is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as offensive or sickening. The composition is balanced and orderly, devoid of any chaotic or disturbing elements. Therefore, there are no visual cues present that would elicit any degree of disgust from a viewer."
untitled-1948.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting is an abstract composition dominated by a vibrant red field, overlaid with various abstract shapes, lines, and scribbles in muted tones of grey, brown, white, and pink. There is absolutely nothing within this artwork that visually suggests decay, putrefaction, contamination, unhygienic conditions, bodily fluids, waste, or any other common triggers of disgust. The shapes are non-representational, and while some lines crisscross, they do not create a sense of overwhelming chaos or messiness that might approach an aesthetically unpleasant, revulsive feeling. The colors, though vibrant in the red, are not sickly or indicative of anything foul. There are no textures or implied smells that would evoke a visceral feeling of revulsion. The overall impression is one of energetic abstraction rather than anything repulsive or off-putting. A score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any visual stimulus, no matter how benign, might trigger a minute, idiosyncratic negative response in an individual, but for the vast majority, there are no elements contributing to disgust here."
untitled-1966(3).jpg,abstract,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork features a soft, ethereal palette dominated by whites, creams, and pale blues, often associated with tranquility, purity, and lightness. The textures are gentle and painterly, suggesting cloud-like forms or soft brushwork, entirely devoid of anything slimy, coarse, or repulsive. The two central circular elements, one in a muted reddish-purple and the other in a clear yellow, are clean, distinct, and integrated into the abstract composition without suggesting any organic decay, disease, or unpleasant bodily matter. There is no depiction of filth, contamination, gore, or anything that violates standards of cleanliness or purity. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, it lacks any narrative or symbolic content that could provoke moral disgust. The overall impression is one of calm, serenity, and artistic expression, which stands in direct opposition to any sensation of revulsion or distaste."
untitled-1968-2.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, characterized by its abstract bands of blue and yellow, evokes no discernible sense of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or morally reprehensible subjects. This artwork presents none of these elements. The colors, a vibrant yellow and various shades of blue, are generally perceived as calming, energetic, or profound, rather than sickly, muddy, or repulsive. The visible brushstrokes contribute to the texture and character of the painting, rather than suggesting anything unclean or chaotic. As an abstract composition focused on color and form, it lacks any narrative or figural content that could trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion. Therefore, the visual information presented does not align with any stimuli commonly associated with the emotion of disgust."

There are no discernible figures, objects, or scenes that could be interpreted as repulsive, offensive, or unclean. Disgust, as an emotion, is typically triggered by sensory input associated with decay, contamination, or things that are viscerally unpleasant. This painting presents none of these qualities. The lines are clean and deliberate, the color palette is muted and harmonious rather than garish or sickly, and the overall composition, while dynamic, does not convey chaos or disorder in a way that would induce revulsion. There is simply nothing within the visual elements – form, color, texture, or implied content – that would reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust or aversion. The artwork is intellectual and formal in its presentation, completely devoid of any elements that could trigger a visceral negative reaction."
untitled-11.jpg,abstract,25.0,"The painting does not primarily evoke disgust, but there are certain elements that could trigger a mild, secondary sense of visceral unease or revulsion for some viewers, leading to a low-moderate score. The overwhelming dark, earthy palette of browns and blacks, while heavy and somber, does not inherently suggest anything putrid or unclean to the extent of generating strong disgust.

However, the most significant contributor to any feeling of disgust lies in the heavily textured, thick application of paint, particularly in the lower portion of the canvas. The large horizontal mass of white and gray, rendered with substantial impasto, appears somewhat lumpy and congealed. Within this white area, there are distinct splashes and smears of bright red, along with other dark flecks. This combination of thick, almost visceral white texture and stark red coloration can, for some, trigger associations with bodily fluids, wounds, or organic decay (e.g., blood, pus, or a raw, exposed surface). The raw, unrefined quality of the paint application throughout the canvas, giving it a somewhat ""grimy"" or ""muddy"" appearance, might also contribute to a subtle sense of unpleasantness or uncleanliness.

Despite these aspects, the abstract nature of the forms prevents any explicit depiction of something truly repulsive. The shapes are not clearly identifiable as decaying matter or waste. The potential for disgust is therefore highly subjective and relies on specific interpretations of the textures and color juxtapositions as opposed to a direct, universally revolting image. It's more of a subtle unsettling sensation related to perceived rawness or messiness rather than overt revulsion."
untitled-28.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting, with its deep, dark, almost monolithic rectangular forms and subtle textural variations, evokes feelings of solemnity, depth, or perhaps contemplation, rather than disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things that are unclean, rotten, offensive, or visually repulsive. This abstract work presents no identifiable objects, colors, or textures that could be associated with decay, filth, or any kind of visceral revulsion. The colors, while dark and rich (deep reds, browns, blacks), do not suggest putrefaction or illness. The composition is orderly and meditative, lacking any chaotic or grotesque elements. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing within the visual information of this painting that would provoke a sensation of disgust."
untitled-2012-6.jpg,abstract,88.5,"The artwork evokes a significant level of disgust primarily through its chosen palette, texture, and the unsettling implication of its material. The dominant color, a deep, muddled magenta-red, is reminiscent of congealed blood, raw meat, or internal organs, steering clear of a vibrant or appealing hue. This immediately triggers a visceral association with biological matter in an unappetizing or degraded state.

The texture is perhaps the most potent contributor to disgust. It appears thick, lumpy, viscous, and unevenly applied, with an almost repulsive tactile quality. There are areas that look clotted, desiccated, or even like a sticky, fungal growth. The way the substance seems to ooze or adhere to the edges, revealing glimpses of what appears to be a circuit board or electronic component beneath, further amplifies this revulsion. This juxtaposition of seemingly organic decay with artificial technology creates an uncanny and disturbing effect, suggesting something has gone profoundly wrong or is in an advanced state of decomposition. The small flecks of white and brownish-gold interspersed throughout the red add to this sense of rot or impurity, mimicking mold, pus, or dried bodily fluids. The overall impression is one of raw, decaying material that is unctuous and inherently unpleasant to behold, prompting a strong physical sensation of aversion."

The colors, including shades of blue, green, red, black, and beige, are clean and well-defined, devoid of any muddy, sickly, or decaying tones that might suggest contamination or decay. The shapes are crisp, geometric, and orderly, offering no distorted or unsettling forms that could be interpreted as grotesque or repulsive. There are no representational elements that could evoke disgust, such as bodily fluids, waste, gore, or scenes of decay. The overall aesthetic is one of structured abstraction, which, by its very nature, tends to bypass such visceral reactions. The texture appears to be either smooth or slightly chalky, but not in a way that suggests unpleasantness or grime.

Firstly, while the color red can be associated with blood, the specific hue and presentation here are those of a pigment on canvas, not a depiction of viscous or decaying organic matter. It reads as a strong, saturated color field rather than a visceral representation of a wound or bodily fluids. There is no suggestion of stickiness, congealedness, or anything that would prompt a physical sensation of revulsion.

Secondly, the textured surface, which shows variations in paint application and possibly some subtle striations or imperfections, does not resemble anything decaying, slimy, or unhygienic. These textures appear to be part of the artistic process, adding depth and materiality to the surface, rather than representing a substance that would cause a feeling of nausea or aversion.

Finally, the abstract nature of the composition means there is no narrative or representational imagery that could elicit moral disgust (e.g., violence, injustice, cruelty). The simple, bold forms and monochromatic dominance create a mood that is perhaps intense, somber, or contemplative, but utterly devoid of any visual cues that would trigger a physiological or psychological response of disgust. The artwork offers nothing that prompts the urge to recoil or feel repulsion."
variation-on-a-theme-1958.jpg,abstract,0.1,"My assessment yields an extremely low score for disgust, approaching zero, because there is virtually nothing within this image that triggers a sensation of revulsion, aversion, or unpleasantness. The artwork is a textile piece, likely a weaving, characterized by its clean presentation, orderly geometric patterns, and natural, earthy color palette of browns, grays, off-white, and subtle yellow/gold tones.

Disgust is typically evoked by stimuli that are perceived as unhygienic, decaying, contaminated, offensive to the senses (e.g., putrid smells, grotesque sights), or morally repugnant. None of these elements are present here. The fabric appears well-maintained, free from any stains, tears, or signs of deterioration that might suggest neglect or decay. The patterns, while abstract and repetitive, are not chaotic, jarring, or optically disturbing in a way that could induce aesthetic discomfort akin to disgust. The overall craftsmanship appears high, contributing to an impression of care and deliberate creation rather than something haphazard or repulsive. There is no narrative or representational content that could provoke moral or conceptual disgust. Therefore, the visual information conveyed by this image entirely bypasses any pathways that would typically lead to a sensation of disgust. The score is not an absolute zero only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic and highly personal, yet entirely unfounded, negative reaction by an extremely rare individual, but from an objective and common human emotional response perspective, disgust is entirely absent."
untitled-2.jpg,abstract,72.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of disgust through its tactile and visual rendering of decay, grime, and unhealthiness. The most prominent element contributing to this feeling is the extremely heavy and uneven impasto, which creates a textured surface that appears to be encrusted, clotted, or matted. This physicality of the paint suggests accumulated filth, dried residue, or organic matter in an advanced state of decomposition, triggering a visceral, almost tactile repulsion. The dominant color palette of murky purples, bruised grays, and deep blacks, lacking any vibrancy or freshness, contributes significantly to an atmosphere of stagnation, neglect, and general unwholesomeness. These colors, combined with the chaotic application, suggest a surface that is dirty, polluted, and has undergone an unpleasant transformation. Sporadic flecks of dull green further enhance the impression of mold or putrefaction, while the scattered, stark red marks can be interpreted as dried bloodstains or rust, adding a disturbing, bodily dimension to the sense of decay. The overall impression is one of a raw, unrefined materiality that is not merely abstract but actively suggests a state of uncleanliness and deterioration, prompting a subtle but persistent sensation of revulsion, akin to encountering something neglected, festering, or deeply unhygienic."
variation-z-rtlichkeiten-1917.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This abstract painting presents a vibrant and harmonious interplay of colors and organic shapes. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that could evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, contamination, bodily effluvia, or morally repugnant subject matter. This painting, being abstract, lacks any recognizable objects or narratives that might fall into these categories. The colors, while varied, are generally pleasing and well-balanced, and the forms are soft and non-threatening. There is nothing visually offensive, repulsive, or stomach-churning about the composition, brushwork, or color palette. The work appears to be purely an exploration of color and form, devoid of any content that would elicit an averse visceral reaction."
wall-handball-study-1942.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This artwork, characterized by its abstract forms, vibrant yet harmoniously blended colors, and dynamic lines, does not evoke any sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, grotesque, unhygienic, or morally offensive. The shapes, while abstract, do not suggest anything decayed, corrupted, or physically unpleasant; they appear to be stylized figures and geometric forms interacting in a light and energetic manner. The color palette of muted greens, browns, reds, and yellows is not sickly or putrid, nor does it create a sense of unease or revulsion. There are no disturbing textures, distorted visages, or unsettling narratives that would elicit a feeling of repulsion or nausea. The overall impression is one of visual exploration and dynamic composition, completely devoid of any characteristics that would align with the emotion of disgust."
untitled-formerly-self-portrait-1945.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The painting contains absolutely no visual elements typically associated with the emotion of disgust. There are no depictions of decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily fluids, or grotesque forms. The color palette of stark black, clean white, and vibrant yellow is bold and striking, not sickly or repulsive. The abstract forms, while sometimes appearing organic or skeletal, are rendered with precision and a sense of architectural or symbolic structure, entirely devoid of any qualities that would induce revulsion, nausea, or a sense of contamination. The overall impression is one of stark symbolism and dynamic abstraction, not one that triggers any feeling of disgust."
weehawken-sequence-1916.jpg,abstract,0.0,"This painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. The subject matter appears to be a landscape, possibly featuring bare trees and some distant structures, rendered in an abstract or semi-abstract style. There are no visual elements that depict decay, filth, gore, disease, or any other traditionally repulsive imagery that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion. The colors, while featuring blues, grays, and earthy tones, are not unsettling or sickening in their combination or application. The brushwork, while expressive, does not create forms that are grotesque or offensive. The overall impression is one of a stylized natural or urban scene, devoid of any content that would provoke a visceral negative reaction associated with disgust."
weehawken-sequence-no-30-1916.jpg,abstract,0.5,"The painting presents an abstracted landscape with a palette dominated by blues, grays, whites, and earthy tones. There are no elements within the composition—such as subject matter, color choice, or brushwork—that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is an emotion generally triggered by something offensive, repulsive, or sickening, often associated with contamination, decay, or things that are physically or morally repellent. This artwork does not depict any of these characteristics. The forms are abstract and suggestive of natural elements like trees, sky, and land, but they are rendered in a way that is devoid of any unpleasant or repulsive qualities. The colors are not jarring or sickly, and there is no hint of decay, filth, or any grotesque imagery. Therefore, there is virtually no basis to associate this painting with the emotion of disgust. The score is marginally above zero to acknowledge the subjective nature of emotional responses, but it is extremely low given the complete lack of discernible triggers for disgust."
yellow-and-green-brushstrokes-1966.jpg,abstract,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this piece solely on its capacity to evoke disgust, I find no discernible elements that would trigger such an emotional response. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, illness, contamination, offensive bodily fluids, or grotesque and repulsive forms. This artwork, characterized by its bold, graphic lines in vibrant yellow and black, set against a muted lavender-grey background, and featuring stylized dark green forms and paint splatters, presents none of these triggers. The aesthetic is clean, sharp, and highly stylized, reminiscent of Pop Art's commercial and comic book influences. The ""splatters"" and ""drips"" are artistic representations of paint in motion, lacking any realistic texture or context that would suggest messiness, unsanitary conditions, or anything physically or morally offensive. The color palette, while strong, is not sickly or putrid. There is an overall sense of energy and visual dynamism, rather than anything decaying, soiled, or unsettlingly grotesque. Therefore, from an expert perspective focused exclusively on the emotion of disgust, this painting registers at the absolute minimum."
verticals-157.jpg,abstract,35.5,"The artwork evokes a mild to moderate sense of disgust primarily through its textural qualities and choice of materials. The background features a rough, uneven, and granular surface, reminiscent of dried mud, coarse concrete, or weathered stone. Scattered across this surface are irregular, raised circular elements that, combined with the muted, somewhat muddy palette of greens, browns, and grays, could subtly suggest an unhygienic environment, dried residue, or even skin blemishes or fungal growths. This raw, gritty texture, devoid of smoothness or cleanliness, creates a feeling of mild revulsion for those sensitive to tactile impressions of contamination or neglect. The vertical elements, resembling dark, irregularly shaped sticks or weathered planks, further contribute to this sense of unrefined, possibly decayed, or discarded matter. While there is no explicit depiction of bodily fluids, rot, or explicit filth, the overall aesthetic leans into the raw, unpolished, and somewhat 'grimy' side of existence, triggering a low to moderate feeling of disgust stemming from an implied lack of hygiene or a state of natural, unappealing degradation."
why-why-why-triptych.jpg,abstract,0.0,"The artwork, an abstract triptych, presents no visual cues that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is a primal emotion often triggered by specific stimuli related to decay, bodily fluids, contamination, putrefaction, or grotesque, repulsive forms. This painting is composed of geometric and fluid abstract shapes, a blend of warm and cool colors (ochre, orange, red, blues, grays), and visible brushstrokes, but none of these elements read as sickly, unhygienic, or inherently repulsive. The textures are those of paint on canvas, not suggestive of slime, grime, or decay. The composition is dynamic and visually intricate, focusing on light, depth, and color interaction rather than anything chaotic or foul. There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as disgusting, nor does the aesthetic quality of the piece lean towards anything grotesque or revolting. Therefore, there is no basis within the artwork to elicit a sensation of disgust."
white-line-1936.jpg,abstract,8.0,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this artwork. While there are no overt depictions of anything conventionally repulsive, a very subtle and indirect sense of unease, which *could* lean towards a low-level of disgust for some viewers, stems from a few elements. The organic, amorphous shapes, particularly when rendered with the detailed, mottled, or pitted textures (such as the irregular dots on the blue and purple forms, or the circular patterns on the brown shape), might vaguely recall microscopic cellular anomalies, diseased tissues, or even certain types of mold or decay when viewed through a negative lens. The subdued, somewhat muted color palette, combined with these organic forms, could contribute to a feeling of something internal, dormant, or perhaps slightly unsettling due to its abstract biological resemblance. However, these interpretations are highly subjective and weak. The dominant impression of the painting is one of intricate abstraction, balance, and visual interest, which overwhelmingly overrides any potential for genuine revulsion. There is nothing visceral, grotesque, or intentionally sickening presented. Therefore, any feeling of disgust would be extremely mild, fleeting, and dependent on a very specific, perhaps negative, projection onto the abstract forms, rather than being an inherent or strong response to the artwork itself."
