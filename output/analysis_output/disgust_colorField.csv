after-the-cloud.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this abstract painting that would evoke disgust. Disgust is typically associated with reactions to things that are offensive, repulsive, unclean, sickening, or morally objectionable. The artwork features soft, blended gradients of green and blue, with a subtle horizontal line of orange/brown. The colors are harmonious and calming, and the overall composition is abstract, focusing on color and atmosphere rather than any representational imagery that could trigger a negative visceral reaction. There are no disturbing textures, jarring contrasts, unpleasant forms, or any subject matter that could be perceived as repulsive or sickening. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate as there is no discernible element within the artwork that contributes to or elicits a feeling of disgust."
aberddeen-i-1970.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract artwork elicits no sense of disgust whatsoever. There are no elements within the painting that are visually repulsive, unhygienic, or morally offensive. The color palette, composed of soft pale pinks and light blues against a neutral, textured background, is aesthetically gentle and calming, rather than jarring, sickly, or nauseating. The technique, characterized by deliberate paint drips forming a frame-like structure, appears intentional and controlled, contributing to a clean and orderly composition, rather than suggesting messiness, decay, or contamination. There are no identifiable forms or textures that could be associated with unpleasant or decaying matter. The overall impression is one of visual tranquility and aesthetic abstraction, completely devoid of any stimuli that would provoke a feeling of revulsion or strong aversion."
318-61-1961.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, an abstract color field painting featuring a gradient from yellow to orange, red, and finally deep red, evokes no sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, sickening, or offensive to the senses, often associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, or morally reprehensible actions. This painting contains none of these visual cues or implications. The colors, a warm spectrum, are vibrant and harmonious, often associated with natural phenomena like sunsets or fire, or with emotions such as energy and passion. The smooth, continuous transition between hues is aesthetically pleasing and calming rather than disturbing. There are no jarring contrasts, unpleasant textures, or figurative elements that could be perceived as grotesque or repellent. The clean presentation and the nature of the abstract subject matter preclude any feeling of revulsion or nausea."
29-03-60-1960.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting presents no visual elements or thematic content that would evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are perceived as unclean, decaying, putrid, repulsive, or morally offensive. The artwork consists of large, geometric blocks of bold color—deep maroon, black, and vibrant red, bordered by hints of yellow, green, and blue. The composition is structured and orderly, and while the paint application shows some texture and slight imperfections at the edges, these are characteristic of the medium and process, not indicative of anything vile or unhygienic. There is no representation of organic decay, bodily fluids, waste, grotesque forms, or any subject matter that is commonly associated with revulsion. The colors, though intense, do not inherently convey a sense of repulsion. Therefore, this painting offers no cues that would stimulate a physiological or emotional response of disgust."
19-1963-1963.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the painting solely for the emotion of disgust, I find absolutely no elements within this artwork that would elicit such a response. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues related to decay, contamination, grotesque imagery, physical revulsion, or strong moral offense. This painting is an abstract work, primarily composed of two large fields of reddish-pink hues separated by a vertical, slightly wavering white line.

There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as decaying, unsanitary, or physically repulsive. The colors, while perhaps somber or introspective to some, are not inherently sickening or offensive to the eye. The composition is simple and balanced, lacking any chaotic or disturbing forms that might provoke an aesthetic sense of revulsion. The texture appears painted and organic, not indicative of anything that would induce nausea or aversion. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, it carries no explicit narrative or moral content that could trigger ethical or moral disgust. The visual information presented in the artwork offers no stimuli commonly associated with feelings of disgust, making a score of 0 appropriate and accurate."
1952-a-1952.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, characterized by its deep, contemplative blues, indigo, and a contrasting vertical yellow stripe, presents an abstract visual experience devoid of any elements typically associated with disgust. Disgust as an emotional response is usually triggered by visual representations of decay, defilement, the grotesque, unhygienic conditions, or repulsive bodily matter. This painting contains none of these visual cues. The textures visible in the large blue field are painterly, showcasing brushstrokes and drips, which contribute to the depth and dynamism of the surface but do not evoke anything slimy, putrid, or tactilely offensive. The color palette, though intense and perhaps brooding, utilizes hues that are rich and atmospheric rather than sickly, discordant, or putrefactive. The composition is structured and visually engaging, lacking any chaotic or unsettling elements that might induce a sense of visceral revulsion. Consequently, there are no visual or thematic prompts within this artwork that could reasonably lead to a feeling of disgust."
867-97-vulcano-1997.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting primarily evokes a sense of vibrant color and abstract form rather than any feeling of revulsion or strong disapproval. The dominant color is a striking, saturated pinkish-red, which is clean, bright, and far from colors typically associated with decay, illness, or putrefaction. The circular format presents a contained, almost meditative quality.

While there is a textured, darker reddish-brown section at the bottom, its appearance does not trigger disgust. The texture could be interpreted in various ways – perhaps as frothy waves, granular earth, or abstract crystalline formations – but none of these interpretations inherently suggest anything unhygienic, contaminated, or biologically repulsive. The boundaries between the colors are sharp yet naturally flowing, and the overall impression is one of artistic design rather than organic decay or filth. There is no representational content that would provoke a visceral negative reaction. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is virtually absent, meriting a very low score."
1.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract painting, likely by Mark Rothko, there is nothing within its visual characteristics that elicits any degree of disgust. Disgust is typically a reaction to something perceived as repulsive, unclean, contaminated, or morally offensive. This artwork, consisting of large, soft-edged rectangular fields of color (deep red-brown, medium blue, and dark blue/black), presents no recognizable figures, objects, or narrative elements that could trigger such a response. The colors, while deep and perhaps somber to some, are rich and atmospheric rather than evoking decay, illness, or any form of unpleasant physical sensation. The soft transitions and expansive nature of the color fields contribute to a contemplative or immersive experience, entirely devoid of any qualities that would be considered aesthetically or viscerally offensive or sickening. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent."
alya-1964.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that evoke a sense of disgust. The image features four identical, stylized shapes in dark green with an orange-red center bordered by white, arranged neatly against a plain white background. The colors are bold but not jarring or unappetizing. The shapes are abstract and clean, devoid of any visual characteristics commonly associated with disgust, such as decay, rot, grime, waste, bodily fluids, disease, or any organic material in a state of decomposition. There is nothing visually repulsive, nauseating, or offensive depicted. The repetition and orderliness contribute to a sense of visual calm rather than revulsion. Therefore, the artwork offers no sensory or conceptual triggers that would incite an emotional response of disgust."
alruccabah-1964.jpg,colorField,1.0,"My assessment for disgust is extremely low, bordering on zero. There are absolutely no elements within this abstract painting that would trigger a sensation of disgust. Disgust typically arises from encountering something unclean, repulsive, offensive, putrid, or morally objectionable. This artwork, however, presents a clean, organized composition of color and form. The colors chosen—a warm, earthy reddish-brown, a verdant green, and a calming blue, all framed by an off-white—are generally considered pleasant and harmonious rather than clashing or nauseating. The organic, wavy contours of the nested shapes are soft and fluid, devoid of any sharp, aggressive, or chaotic lines that might cause unease, let alone disgust. There are no depictions of anything literal that could be associated with decay, grime, foulness, or anything inherently repulsive. The painting is purely an exploration of color and form, presented in a clean and aesthetically unchallenging manner. Consequently, the visual experience of this piece offers nothing that would provoke a visceral, negative reaction of disgust."
amarillo-1971.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This image evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The composition is exceptionally clean, geometric, and abstract, presenting crisp lines and smooth, uniform color fields. The dominant bright yellow hue, paired with the light gray/white slit, conveys a feeling of vibrancy, clarity, and precision, rather than anything that might be perceived as repulsive or sickening. There are no elements that suggest contamination, decay, filth, or any form of organic unpleasantness typically associated with the emotion of disgust. The sterile, almost clinical perfection of the lines and surfaces actively works against any sensation of grubbiness or revulsion. The image is devoid of textures, forms, or implied narratives that could trigger a visceral negative reaction or moral repugnance."
appleby-2011.jpg,colorField,0.5,"There is virtually no element within this artwork that elicits a feeling of disgust. The three panels of paper present a clean, minimalist aesthetic. The color palette is a neutral, light off-white or cream, devoid of any hues typically associated with decay, illness, or unpleasant substances. The visible texture, characterized by subtle fibers and slight irregularities, is consistent with handmade paper and contributes to an organic, natural feel rather than suggesting any form of impurity or uncleanliness. While there are a few very minute, dark specks on the surface, particularly noticeable in the cropped views, these are so tiny and few that they appear to be inherent to the paper's natural composition—perhaps small embedded fibers or pulp variations—rather than foreign contaminants or dirt. They are certainly not large or prominent enough to trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The torn or deckled edges of the paper, typical of its production method, add to its authentic character and do not suggest damage or decay. The overall impression is one of simple material study, purity, and quiet contemplation, completely antithetical to any sensation of disgust. Any score above zero is purely to acknowledge the extreme theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic individual response, but based on common aesthetic triggers for disgust, this work offers none."
apricot-ripple-1968.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting, characterized by an orderly arrangement of vertical stripes in a wide spectrum of colors, elicits no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is typically a response to something perceived as repulsive, unhygienic, morally objectionable, or physically sickening. The clean lines, vibrant and diverse color palette (including blues, greens, yellows, reds, pinks, purples, browns, and grays), and the abstract nature of the composition do not present any visual cues that could trigger such a reaction. There are no disturbing textures, no depictions of decay or bodily fluids, no chaotic or jarring elements that might induce a feeling of revulsion. The painting is purely an exploration of color and form, presenting an aesthetically neutral to pleasant visual experience that is entirely devoid of any characteristics associated with disgust."
attacca-1975.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by something repulsive, unclean, putrid, or morally offensive. The artwork, an abstract composition of colorful brushstrokes on a neutral background, presents none of these qualities. The colors are vibrant and appear to be applied with clean, bold strokes. There is no imagery of decay, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or anything visually unappealing or grotesque. The texture, if discernible, seems to be a straightforward application of paint, not something that would elicit revulsion. The overall impression is one of visual simplicity and color interaction, entirely devoid of any elements that would provoke an aversive reaction associated with disgust."
all-night-1989.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The painting predominantly features abstract forms and bold color blocking (deep blue, bright red, vibrant yellow), which do not inherently provoke a feeling of disgust. There are no elements of gore, filth, putrefaction, grotesque imagery, or anything conventionally offensive to the senses. The brushwork, particularly in the deep blue area, creates texture and movement, but it does not suggest anything physically repulsive.

However, a very marginal and highly subjective trace of aversion, bordering on what might be a conceptual or intellectual form of disgust, could potentially be linked to the three vertical, greyish forms. These forms, which could be interpreted as highly stylized or abstracted tree trunks, appear somewhat barren, withered, or faded. This faint suggestion of decay, lifelessness, or desolation in nature, while not explicit or visceral, might for a highly sensitive viewer evoke a fleeting, almost imperceptible sense of disquiet or mild displeasure that touches the outermost edge of disgust for things perceived as unhealthy or dying. This is an extremely tenuous connection, not a primary or intended emotional response, and certainly not a visceral one, thus warranting an exceptionally low score."
ayin-1958.jpg,colorField,0.1,"There is virtually no element in this painting that evokes a sense of disgust. The artwork features soft, flowing vertical streaks of muted colors, predominantly pastels and earthy tones (such as soft blues, greens, mauves, and muted yellows/browns), against a white background. The forms are abstract and organic, resembling perhaps a gentle waterfall or a draped fabric, wider at the top and narrowing towards the bottom. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque distortion, or something inherently repulsive or sickening. This painting contains none of these elements. The colors are harmonious and non-jarring, the shapes are fluid and non-threatening, and there is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as offensive or putrid. The overall aesthetic leans towards calmness, contemplation, or ethereal beauty, entirely devoid of any qualities that would provoke revulsion or nausea. A score of 0.1 is given to reflect the absolute minimum, acknowledging the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association, but objectively, there's nothing in the artwork itself to warrant this emotion."
autumn-leaves-fluttering-in-the-breeze-1973.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork elicits no sensation of disgust. The vibrant and clean hues of orange, set against the bright blues and greens, are visually stimulating rather than repellent. There are no elements within the composition that suggest decay, contamination, bodily fluids, or any other common triggers for disgust. The irregular, mosaic-like shapes are abstract and do not resolve into forms that could be interpreted as vile, diseased, or otherwise repulsive. The implied texture, based on the visible brushstrokes, suggests painted canvas, which is not inherently disgusting. The overall impression is one of energy and visual rhythm, completely devoid of any qualities that would provoke an aversive or nauseating response."
banjo-1981.jpg,colorField,0.5,"This abstract painting, composed of vertical stripes in various shades of yellow, blue, and reddish-brown/pink, elicits virtually no sensation of disgust. The visual elements present in the artwork do not trigger any of the typical responses associated with this emotion. There is an absence of imagery that would commonly induce revulsion, such as representations of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, distorted or diseased forms, or anything that suggests unhygienic conditions or putrefaction. The color palette, while varied, consists of hues that are not inherently sickening or unpleasant; they are rather earthy and muted, contributing to a calm or contemplative feeling rather than one of nausea or aversion. The repetitive, vertical striped pattern is organized and lacks any chaotic or unsettling qualities that might disorient or disturb the viewer in a way that could lean towards disgust. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the piece means there is no discernible subject matter or narrative that could be interpreted as repulsive. The texture appears somewhat brushed or faded, which is an artistic effect and not suggestive of anything vile or slimy. Overall, the painting's aesthetic is far removed from anything that would provoke a visceral or psychological reaction of disgust, resulting in a score very close to absolute zero. The minimal score of 0.5 acknowledges the subjective nature of emotional response but strongly affirms the complete lack of any discernible triggers for disgust within this specific artwork."
backbone-1979.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract composition dominated by an intense field of red with fine, horizontal strokes and a subtle curve at the bottom, contains no elements typically associated with the emotion of disgust. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, gore, or any subject matter that would trigger a visceral sense of repulsion or aversion. The color, a vibrant and clean red, does not appear sickly, contaminated, or unappealing in a way that would evoke disgust. Furthermore, the texture created by the fine lines is intricate and deliberate, contributing to the visual interest of the piece rather than suggesting anything repulsive or unpleasant to touch or view. The overall aesthetic is clean, intentional, and focused on color and form, completely devoid of any visual cues that might lead to a feeling of revulsion. A score of 0.5 acknowledges the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly subjective response, but for the vast majority, there is nothing within this image to elicit disgust."
beta-lambda-1961.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This painting, characterized by its vibrant, flowing lines and a clean, minimalist background, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, contamination, bodily fluids, gore, or things that are inherently repulsive and aversive. The lines in the painting are clearly artistic elements, appearing as cleanly applied or dripped paint in a variety of colors. There is nothing in the texture, color palette, or composition that suggests anything unhygienic, decaying, or otherwise disgusting. The colors are bright and distinct, not muddied or sickly. The overall impression is one of organized abstraction, not chaos or revulsion. A score of 0.1 is given to acknowledge the remote theoretical possibility that *any* image might trigger a unique, idiosyncratic, and highly subjective negative response in an individual, but for the vast majority of viewers, there are no elements within this artwork that align with the common triggers for disgust."
archimandrite-1960.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The painting is an abstract composition primarily featuring broad strokes of blue, white, and green. There is no representational subject matter that could inherently trigger disgust, such as gore, decay, or anything visually repulsive. The color palette itself, consisting of various shades of blue, a dominant white, and a deep green, is generally perceived as natural and often calming or evocative of landscapes (sky, water, foliage), rather than being jarring or sickening. The composition is simple and balanced, lacking any chaotic or unsettling elements that might contribute to a sense of revulsion. The brushwork and texture of the paint, particularly in the white and green areas, show some variation and mottling. While the white central band does have some subtle greyish or darker specks and an overall slightly less-than-pristine appearance, which could be *very loosely* associated with a minuscule sense of 'uncleanliness' or 'grubbiness' for an extremely sensitive viewer, this interpretation is highly tenuous and largely overshadowed by the overall artistic texture and depth. These elements are far more likely to be seen as painterly qualities or indications of the material rather than anything genuinely disgusting or contaminated. Thus, any feeling of disgust elicited by this artwork is virtually negligible."
blue-and-yellow-and-red-orange-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork, characterized by its clean lines, primary colors (blue, yellow, red), and simple geometric shapes (ovals) stacked vertically on a pristine white background, contains absolutely no elements that would typically evoke a sensation of disgust. Disgust is an emotion often triggered by things that are foul, contaminating, grotesque, or morally repugnant. The image presents none of these qualities. The colors are vibrant and pure, the shapes are smooth and harmonious, and the overall composition is one of order and minimalist aesthetic appeal. There are no disturbing textures, offensive subjects, unsettling arrangements, or any visual cues that could be interpreted as repulsive or unpleasant. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent when viewing this piece."
blues-reds-1969.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork is a clean, abstract composition dominated by large, bold blocks of color (vibrant blue, deep navy, and striking red) set against a muted, earthy-toned background. There are no discernible elements within the visual language of this piece that would trigger a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by imagery related to decay, contamination, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, filth, or anything perceived as inherently repulsive or unhygienic. This painting, however, presents none of these characteristics. The colors are clear and distinct, the shapes are geometric and orderly, and there is no representational subject matter that could incite such a visceral reaction. Even the textural qualities of the print, visible as slight variations in the background or subtle imperfections in the color blocks, do not lean towards anything that could be considered unclean or unsettling. The overall impression is one of visual exploration of color relationships and spatial arrangement, devoid of any content or aesthetic qualities commonly associated with disgust."
black-on-maroon-4.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting elicits no discernible feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by stimuli associated with decay, contamination, putrefaction, grotesque imagery, or moral repulsion. The artwork presents an abstract field of deep, rich reds and dark browns, characteristic of Mark Rothko's color field paintings. While the colors may evoke associations with earth, blood, or internal states, their application and overall composition are contemplative and solemn, rather than physically or morally repulsive. There are no jarring forms, sickly colors, or literal representations of anything that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. The surface appears soft and layered, lacking any texture or visual quality that might be perceived as slimy, unhygienic, or otherwise disagreeable to the senses in a way that causes disgust. The painting's aesthetic qualities lean towards the profound, meditative, or melancholic, none of which align with the emotion of disgust."
blue-painting-2002.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting is a monochromatic blue square with a uniform texture. There are absolutely no elements within the image that could evoke disgust. Disgust is typically associated with visual cues of decay, filth, gore, disease, or things that are overtly repulsive or morally offensive. This artwork presents none of these characteristics. The color blue is generally associated with calm, stability, or vastness, not with feelings of revulsion. The texture, while not perfectly smooth, appears to be that of paint on a canvas, without any suggestion of decay, sliminess, or other properties that would be physically unsettling or repulsive. Therefore, there is no basis to experience disgust from this piece."
broad-turning-1958.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The painting elicits virtually no sense of disgust. There are no elements within the abstract composition that provoke feelings of revulsion, nausea, or a visceral desire to recoil. The palette consists primarily of deep, earthy tones—browns, olive greens, and muted reds—which, while perhaps somber or weighty, are not inherently unpleasant or associated with decay or filth. The forms themselves are large, abstract, and somewhat amorphous, with visible vertical streaking or flowing textures that suggest a liquid or saturated quality, but this effect does not evoke images of bodily fluids, waste, or putrefaction. There are no grotesque figures, disturbing details, or sickly color combinations that would trigger an immediate response of disgust. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the artwork is one of quiet contemplation, gravity, or organic presence, rather than anything overtly or subtly repugnant. The emotion of disgust is therefore almost entirely absent from the viewing experience of this piece."
beth-zayin-1959.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The emotion of disgust is present to a very subtle degree in this abstract artwork, warranting a low score of 15. The primary visual cues that could evoke this feeling are the large central mass of murky, heavily blended dark colors, particularly the intermingling of browns, deep greens, and grays. These tones, when mixed in such a way, can subtly resemble soiled substances, congealed liquids, or matter in a state of decay, rather than pure or vibrant pigments. This ""muddiness"" or ""dirtiness"" in the color palette might trigger a subconscious association with something unclean, spoiled, or unappetizing. Furthermore, the visible drips of darker paint, especially towards the bottom left of the composition, contribute to this impression by suggesting residue, seepage, or a slow ooze, which can be linked to visual aspects of contamination. The overall lack of crispness or distinct, appealing forms in the central area allows for an ambiguous interpretation where the textures and color blending could be perceived as visually ""unclean"" or mildly unpleasant. However, the presence of more vibrant underlying colors peeking through at the edges (such as reds, blues, greens, and oranges) and the inherently abstract nature of the piece prevent it from eliciting a strong, visceral sense of revulsion. The artwork does not depict anything literally disgusting, and the techniques employed are common in abstract art, often aiming for raw expression rather than repulsion. Therefore, any feeling of disgust evoked is minor and contingent on a very specific and perhaps sensitive interpretation of the visual murkiness and texture rather than a direct, intentional provocation of the emotion."
black-on-maroon-1.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The painting offers virtually no visual cues typically associated with the emotion of disgust. Disgust is often triggered by stimuli related to decay, contamination, filth, grotesque forms, or morally repulsive acts. This abstract work, characterized by large, soft-edged color fields in deep, muted tones of dark blue/black and reddish-brown, contains none of these elements. There are no discernible figures, objects, or scenes that could be interpreted as repulsive, unhygienic, or morally offensive. The colors, while dark and somber, are rich and contemplative, not sickly or putrid. The texture appears brushed and smooth, without any suggestion of sliminess, stickiness, or grit that might evoke a tactile sense of revulsion. The overall aesthetic is one of solemnity and introspection, rather than one designed to provoke a visceral reaction of aversion. While some individuals might find the dark palette or abstract nature unappealing, this general dislike does not equate to the specific emotion of disgust. The score is therefore extremely low, indicating an almost complete absence of any trigger for this emotion."
canto-iii-1963.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, ""Canto II"" by Barnett Newman, is a minimalist abstract print featuring a large black rectangular field bisected by a single narrow white vertical ""zip."" There is absolutely nothing in this composition that elicits a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by something physically repulsive, morally repugnant, or aesthetically grotesque. This artwork contains none of those elements. It is clean, stark, and focused on form, space, and the interplay of color (or lack thereof). Its aesthetic aims for the sublime or contemplative, not the repulsive or offensive. The simple, geometric nature and the controlled execution preclude any visceral negative reaction associated with disgust."
canto-iv-1963.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The artwork presents a stark, minimalist composition dominated by a large black rectangular field bisected by a narrower, slightly darker vertical band, often referred to as a ""zip."" There are no elements within the visual vocabulary of this piece that could reasonably elicit a sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by sensory input associated with decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily effluvia, or moral repugnance. This abstract work contains none of these qualities. The textures, while visible and perhaps tactile in impression, do not suggest anything unclean or repulsive. The use of black, while sometimes associated with solemnity or absence, does not inherently convey disgust. The precise, contemplative nature of the composition, devoid of any figurative or narrative content that could imply moral transgression or physical revulsion, leaves no ground for such an emotion to arise. The feeling is completely absent, as the visual information does not touch upon any common triggers for disgust."
burnt-umber-ultra-marine-l-1981.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The abstract forms, rendered in deep earthy tones against a lighter, somewhat off-white background, are minimalist and non-representational. There are no elements within the composition that suggest anything repulsive, unclean, decaying, or morally objectionable. The colors are muted and natural, lacking the vibrancy or pallor often associated with decay or sickness. The shapes, while solid and dark, do not resemble anything inherently disgusting such as bodily fluids, waste, or organisms typically linked with revulsion. The artistic technique, with its subtle blending and slight bleeding of pigment at the edges, lends an organic, almost atmospheric quality, but this is an aesthetic choice related to the medium (perhaps watercolor or ink wash) and not indicative of filth, putrefaction, or anything physically repugnant. The overall impression leans towards a contemplative or stark aesthetic, possibly evoking a landscape or minimalist architectural forms, none of which would elicit a feeling of disgust. There is simply no visual information present that would trigger a visceral feeling of revulsion or a desire to withdraw, which are hallmarks of the emotion of disgust."
canto-xi-1964.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The artwork, an abstract print by Barnett Newman, consists of two large, simple color fields: a vibrant, uniform yellow on the left and a textured, dark green on the right. There is nothing inherent in the colors themselves, or their combination, that would typically evoke a sensation of disgust. Yellow and green are common natural colors and hold no intrinsically repulsive associations. The composition is straightforward and orderly, devoid of any chaotic, unsettling, or visually noxious elements. While the green field exhibits a textural quality, characteristic of printmaking techniques, it does not resemble anything slimy, putrid, decaying, or otherwise unpleasant to the eye. Similarly, the slightly ragged edge of the yellow field and the overall impression of a hand-printed work convey authenticity and artistic process rather than any sense of contamination or repugnance. Disgust is usually triggered by things perceived as unclean, harmful, or morally offensive. This abstract image contains no such visual cues. The very low score acknowledges the possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly subjective response where certain colors or textures *might* be mildly unsettling to an individual, but for the vast majority, there is nothing in this artwork designed to, or likely to, elicit disgust."
castle-banner-5-2004.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are no elements within this abstract painting that evoke the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things perceived as unclean, decaying, offensive, nauseating, or morally repulsive. This artwork presents a clean, orderly composition of vertical red and light blue stripes. The superimposed grey rectangle and turquoise triangle with diagonal lines are geometric and abstract, devoid of any organic forms, textures, or thematic content that could be interpreted as repulsive, decaying, or aesthetically offensive in a way that would induce physical or moral revulsion. The colors are vibrant and distinct, and the overall impression is one of visual simplicity and organization, rather than anything unsavory or unpleasant."
canto-xiv-1964.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this artwork that evokes a sensation of disgust. The piece is an abstract composition featuring fields of red and maroon. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with revulsion, repulsion, or a strong aversion to something perceived as offensive, putrid, contaminated, or morally repugnant. This artwork presents clean, geometric forms and rich, deep colors. The colors themselves are vibrant and stable, not sickly, decaying, or jarring in a way that would trigger a visceral negative reaction. There is no representational content that could depict something vile or offensive. The texture appears uniform and the composition is balanced and orderly. Consequently, no visual cues are present to incite any feeling of disgust."
cathedral-11-1968.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that elicits disgust. The artwork features vibrant, softened vertical stripes of various colors, including bright yellows, oranges, reds, and teals. The colors are aesthetically pleasing and harmoniously arranged, and the blurred edges give a sense of luminosity rather than anything jarring or unpleasant. There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as grotesque, unhygienic, decaying, or morally repulsive. The composition is clean, orderly, and abstract, focusing purely on color and form. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with revulsion towards things that are offensive, contaminated, or visually disturbing; none of these characteristics are present in this bright, cheerful, and visually appealing work. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent."
canto-xiii-1964.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are no elements within this artwork that evoke a sense of disgust. The piece presents a stark, abstract composition of two vertical color fields. The colors themselves, a golden yellow and an olive green/brown, are not inherently repulsive, nor do they combine in a manner that suggests decay, illness, or putrefaction. While the right panel exhibits a textured surface, this texture appears to be a characteristic of the printing process or an intentional visual effect, rather than suggesting anything physically or morally offensive like slime, filth, or rot. There are no grotesque forms, disturbing subject matter, or sensory qualities that would trigger revulsion. The overall aesthetic is one of minimalist abstraction, completely devoid of any characteristics typically associated with the emotion of disgust."
canto-xii-1964.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork presents a minimalist abstract composition featuring two large, vibrant blocks of color: a bright yellow on the left and a deep green on the right, separated by a clean vertical line. The colors are saturated and appear clean and distinct. While the green block exhibits some textural variation, indicative of the printmaking process, this texture is not suggestive of anything vile, decaying, or contaminated. There are no representational elements that could evoke a feeling of repulsion, nor are the colors or their combination aesthetically jarring or unpleasant in a way that would trigger a visceral aversion. The overall impression is one of visual simplicity and color study, devoid of any sensory or conceptual cues typically associated with disgust."
carthage-1962.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting presents a stark contrast between vibrant red and deep black organic, abstract shapes. There are no elements within the composition that would typically elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is usually provoked by imagery associated with decay, putrefaction, gore, bodily fluids, disease, contamination, or morally reprehensible actions. This artwork depicts none of these. The shapes, while organic and somewhat blob-like, are clean, defined by a crisp white outline, and lack any textural or visual qualities that would suggest something repulsive or offensive. The colors are strong but not inherently sickening, and the overall impression is one of abstract design rather than anything that would induce a visceral feeling of aversion or nausea. Therefore, there is no discernible reason for this artwork to trigger disgust."
cercles-de-nuit-1992.jpg,colorField,0.5,"This artwork evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The primary elements contributing to this assessment are:

1.  **Abstract Nature:** The painting is completely abstract, composed of geometric-like spirals. There are no recognizable figures, objects, or scenes that could be interpreted as grotesque, unhygienic, or morally repugnant.
2.  **Clean Colors and Composition:** The colors (vibrant blue background, crisp red, green, yellow, and white in the spirals) are bright, clean, and distinct. There are no muddy tones, sickly hues, or combinations that suggest decay, illness, or unpleasant bodily fluids. The lines are sharp and the forms are well-defined, contributing to a sense of order and cleanliness rather than messiness or contamination.
3.  **Lack of Disturbing Imagery:** Spirals are dynamic and often associated with movement, energy, or natural phenomena, but they do not inherently carry negative connotations that would induce revulsion. There is no violence, gore, decay, disturbing textures, or imagery related to waste or suffering.
4.  **Overall Aesthetic:** The overall aesthetic is one of vibrancy, harmony, and visual interest. It's a design that feels energetic and visually appealing rather than unsettling or repulsive.

The score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any visual stimulus *could* trigger an idiosyncratic, minor aversion in an extremely rare circumstance, but objectively, there is nothing in this artwork's visual language or content that is designed to, or likely to, evoke disgust in a viewer."
citadel-1962.jpg,colorField,0.1,"My emotional response to this painting registers an extremely negligible level of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, contamination, offensive bodily fluids, or morally repulsive acts. This artwork, however, presents none of these elements. It is an abstract composition of vertical stripes rendered in a variety of clean, distinct colors including blues, greens, browns, white, orange, and red. The lines are sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the overall impression is one of order and visual precision rather than disorder or unpleasantness. There is no representational content that could be interpreted as gruesome, squalid, or vile. The aesthetic is clean, geometric, and non-figurative, offering no visual or conceptual cues that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or sickness. Any score above 0 would be based on an extremely idiosyncratic and uncommon aversion to perfectly orderly, colorful abstract patterns, which is not a general human emotional response. The 0.1 accounts for the absolute theoretical minimum possibility of an extreme, highly unusual, or pathologically adverse reaction to certain color combinations or geometric repetition in a fraction of a percent of individuals, which is not a reflection of the artwork's inherent qualities for eliciting disgust."
coloured-wall-2003.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork presents a composition of abstract, rectangular blocks rendered in a soft, watercolor-like medium. The color palette consists of earthy tones, including browns, oranges, teal, yellow, and a muted red. The shapes are arranged in a grid-like but organic fashion, suggesting a 'coloured wall' as per its title. There is absolutely nothing in this image that would evoke a sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are perceived as unclean, decaying, repulsive, grotesque, or morally objectionable. This artwork contains none of these characteristics. The colors are harmonious and aesthetically pleasing, the forms are simple and non-threatening, and the overall impression is one of calm and aesthetic balance. There are no textures that suggest slime, rot, or filth, nor any subject matter that could be interpreted as vile or offensive. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate, as the artwork offers no visual cues or conceptual undertones that would provoke disgust."
concerto-1975.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The vibrant, clean brushstrokes arranged in a dynamic, diagonal pattern on a muted, swirling grey-blue background create an impression that is either neutral, energetic, or even uplifting, depending on the viewer's interpretation. There are no elements typically associated with disgust, such as grotesque imagery, depictions of decay, filth, disease, violence, or any form of contamination. The colors are distinct and appear pure, the composition is orderly rather than chaotic or unsettling, and there is no subject matter that could inherently provoke revulsion. The painting's abstract nature also means it lacks explicit narrative or symbolism that might convey morally offensive themes. Therefore, the visual experience presented is entirely devoid of triggers for disgust."
dalet-tet-1959.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract painting for the emotion of disgust, I find no elements whatsoever that would evoke such a response. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, bodily fluids, contamination, or morally repulsive subjects. This artwork, however, consists primarily of a large, dark, almost black field with subtle hints of other colors (red, green, blue, yellow) bleeding from the edges, particularly at the top. The texture appears to be either very smooth or subtly layered, and there are no discernible figures, objects, or narratives that could be interpreted as unclean, sickening, or morally offensive. The abstract nature means there is no literal depiction of anything that might cause revulsion. While the dark palette might evoke feelings of solemnity, mystery, or even somberness, it does not possess any qualities that are nauseating, repulsive, or inherently unpleasant in a way that triggers disgust. The painting remains aesthetically neutral or contemplative in terms of this specific emotion."
corot-s-mark-1987.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The artwork is an abstract composition predominantly in shades of blue. The nature of the color blue itself, particularly in these serene and deep tones, does not inherently evoke disgust; it often connotes calm, depth, or introspection. While there are areas of varying saturation and some fluid, almost watery effects, these do not read as unpleasant or repulsive textures like slime, decay, or contamination. The faint lines and subtle variations in tone appear to be part of the artistic process and aesthetic, rather than indicative of filth, decomposition, or any unsanitary conditions. There is no discernible subject matter that could be considered disgusting, and the overall impression is one of visual tranquility rather than aversion or revulsion. The very low score reflects the near absence of any visual cues that would trigger a sensation of disgust."
disneyesque-1971.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork presents as a clean, abstract, and well-defined sculpture. It consists of geometric and flowing forms with a clear, deliberate color palette (shades of grey, red, orange, black, and light blue). There are no elements within the image that typically trigger disgust, such as bodily fluids, decay, disease, messiness, grotesque imagery, or anything that implies unsanitary conditions or moral repugnance. The surfaces appear smooth and the lines are sharp, contributing to a sense of order and cleanliness rather than anything repulsive. The colors, while contrasting, are vibrant and contained, not suggesting anything visceral or unsettling. The abstract nature of the piece means there is no representational content that could be interpreted as disgusting. The score is marginally above zero to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an individual's idiosyncratic and highly subjective negative visceral reaction to any visual stimulus, but there is nothing objectively or commonly associated with disgust in this artwork."
double-gray-scramble-1973.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork consists of two identical (or nearly identical) compositions of concentric squares, rendered with precise geometric lines and a vibrant, ordered palette of colors including black, white, greys, greens, yellows, oranges, and reds. There is absolutely nothing in this image that evokes disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are offensive, repulsive, unclean, grotesque, or morally objectionable. This artwork, by contrast, is characterized by its meticulous order, clean lines, harmonious (or at least deliberately chosen and repeated) color scheme, and abstract nature. There are no elements of decay, messiness, distorted forms, or unsettling subject matter that would give rise to a feeling of revulsion or nausea. The visual experience is one of structured pattern and color variation, entirely devoid of any qualities that align with the emotion of disgust."
dominican-1952-1.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract painting, I find no elements whatsoever that evoke a sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with something offensive, repulsive, nauseating, or that violates a deep sense of aesthetic or moral purity. The artwork presented is a minimalist composition featuring clean, horizontal bands of solid color: two shades of yellow, a thin black line, white, and grey. These colors are common, universally accepted, and do not inherently carry any negative or sickening connotations. There is no representational content that could depict anything foul, decaying, grotesque, or unhygienic. The composition is orderly, balanced, and precise, lacking any chaotic, disturbing, or visually jarring elements that might induce a physical or psychological aversion. The flatness of the color fields and the sharp, clean lines contribute to a sense of serenity and visual neatness, antithetical to the feeling of revulsion. Therefore, based on its color palette, composition, and abstract nature, this painting offers no visual cues or inherent qualities that could reasonably trigger disgust."
delta-lambda-1961.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of disgust in relation to this painting, I find no elements whatsoever that would evoke such a response. Disgust is typically triggered by imagery or suggestions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, disease, contamination, or a deliberate aesthetic of repulsion. This artwork features a clean, bright white background, which acts as a neutral and even pristine canvas. The colorful lines, while depicting a ""dripping"" effect, are clearly composed of vibrant, distinct paint strokes. This technique, common in abstract art, evokes spontaneity and movement rather than any sense of messiness or unsanitary conditions. The colors themselves are varied and generally pleasing, devoid of any sickly or disturbing hues. There is no representational content that could be interpreted as grotesque or offensive. The overall impression is one of visual energy and abstract form, completely devoid of any stimuli that would lead to feelings of revulsion or distaste."
duo-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract composition purely for the emotion of disgust, I find no elements whatsoever that would elicit such a response. Disgust is typically triggered by sensory input that signals contamination, decay, toxicity, or something morally repugnant or physically revolting. This painting, characterized by its serene color palette of a soft periwinkle blue, a deep teal, and a warm terracotta orange, set against a clean white ground, presents no visual cues associated with these triggers. The shapes are organic and fluid, yet entirely abstract, bearing no resemblance to anything corporeal, diseased, or otherwise off-putting. There are no harsh textures, unsettling forms, or discordant colors that could provoke a visceral sense of revulsion. The overall impression is one of tranquility and minimalist aesthetic rather than anything that might be perceived as unpleasant or vile. Therefore, on a scale of 0 to 100, the presence of disgust is absolutely zero."
dawn-stroke-1977.jpg,colorField,7.3,"The painting, an abstract work dominated by soft, earthy tones, generally does not aim to or succeed in eliciting a strong sense of disgust. The pervasive washes of peach, cream, and muted orange create a rather gentle and contemplative atmosphere. However, a very subtle and minor sense of disgust might arise from specific interpretive elements within the abstract forms. The most notable element is the amorphous, somewhat irregular green patch with a small red speck located in the lower left quadrant. This particular formation, with its organic shape and unusual coloration within the otherwise warm palette, could be loosely interpreted by some viewers as resembling a patch of mold, decaying organic matter, or an unidentifiable, unpleasant biological smear or stain. The ""smeared"" or ""splattered"" quality of this patch, though abstract, hints at a lack of cleanliness or a state of decomposition. Similarly, the long, thick white drip on the right side, while likely just paint, could in a highly negative interpretation be seen as a viscous bodily fluid, though this is a very remote reading. The overall impression of the painting being composed of washes and layered stains, while mostly benign, can carry a faint undertone of soiled or aged surfaces for a highly sensitive viewer. Nevertheless, these hints are extremely subtle and abstract; the painting lacks any explicit or visceral imagery typically associated with strong feelings of disgust, resulting in a very low overall score for this emotion."
e-226-1955.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting is an abstract composition characterized by bold, warm colors and simple, organic shapes. The dominant elements include a large, irregular, reddish-orange form against a bright orange background, complemented by a yellow strip at the bottom and a small blue horizontal line. There is absolutely nothing within this visual arrangement that would trigger the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by stimuli associated with decay, contamination, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, or morally reprehensible actions. This artwork contains none of these elements. The colors are vibrant and clean, the forms are abstract and do not represent anything offensive or repulsive, and there is no narrative context to suggest anything morally objectionable. The textures are painterly and do not resemble anything slimy, decaying, or otherwise unpleasant to the touch or sight. Consequently, the painting elicits no sense of revulsion or aversion whatsoever."
east-and-beyond-1973.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork evokes absolutely no sensation of disgust. There are no visual elements present that typically trigger this emotion, such as decay, bodily fluids, unsanitary conditions, or anything physically repulsive. The abstract forms and color palette, consisting primarily of yellow, dark grey, red, green, and blue, are clean and graphic, not sickly or nauseating. The visible texture of the print, while distinct, is part of the artistic process and does not suggest anything physically unpleasant or offensive. The composition is a harmonious arrangement of shapes and colors, devoid of any content that could be interpreted as vile, offensive, or morally objectionable. Therefore, there is nothing in this piece that would elicit a feeling of disgust."
elements-v.jpg,colorField,0.1,"My emotional response to this painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are perceived as repulsive, offensive, unclean, or morally objectionable. This artwork, being an abstract composition of distinct color fields, presents none of these characteristics. The solid blocks of red-brown, blue, yellow, and black are clean, flat, and geometrically ordered, offering no visual information that could be interpreted as decaying, grotesque, or otherwise unappetizing. There are no disturbing textures, chaotic forms, or subjects that might provoke a visceral feeling of revulsion. The painting's serene and balanced structure, along with its straightforward use of color, stands in direct opposition to any stimuli that would typically elicit disgust. Therefore, the feeling of disgust is practically absent when viewing this piece."
earth-sermon-beauty-love-and-peace-1971.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is no discernible element within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork features a vibrant array of vertical stripes, each composed of small, irregular, tessellated blocks of color. The colors are diverse and largely bright—including reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, purples, and browns—and are arranged in a dynamic yet organized pattern. Disgust is typically provoked by visual stimuli associated with decay, disease, bodily fluids, filth, or moral transgression. This painting, being abstract, lacks any subject matter that could be morally offensive. Aesthetically, the colors are clean and distinct, not muddy, sickly, or reminiscent of putrefaction or unhygienic conditions. The texture, though fragmented, is not grotesque, slimy, or viscerally unpleasant; rather, it creates a structured mosaic effect. The overall composition is rhythmic and colorful, providing visual stimulation without any of the characteristics commonly associated with feelings of revulsion or nausea. Therefore, the visual characteristics of this painting offer no pathway to experience disgust."
farbraum-1963.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert, my evaluation of this painting elicits absolutely no sensation of disgust. The artwork presents a serene field of soft blues and lavenders, reminiscent of a sky or a gentle wash of watercolor. The variations in pigment density and the subtle texture created by the medium (likely watercolor or a similar wash technique) are organic and aesthetically pleasing, suggesting the natural flow and interaction of paint and surface. There are no harsh, jarring, or sickly colors; no grotesque or unsettling forms; and no imagery that remotely suggests decay, filth, or anything biologically or morally repugnant. The overall impression is one of tranquility and ethereal beauty, which stands in direct opposition to any feeling of revulsion. Therefore, based on its visual properties and thematic absence of anything offensive, the emotion of disgust is entirely unprovoked by this piece."
exposition-sam-francis-19-mars-5-mai-1983-poster.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract work by Sam Francis, I find no elements within the painting that would elicit the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily effluvia, or a fundamental sense of corruption or revulsion. This artwork, characterized by vibrant splatters, energetic drips, and large washes of bright, clean colors (orange, yellow, purple, blue, green) on a stark white background, actively works against such associations. While the application technique involves a certain ""messiness"" or ""chaos"" through the act of dripping and splashing paint, this is an intentional artistic choice inherent to Abstract Expressionism. This aesthetic choice conveys dynamism, spontaneity, and a lively interaction of color and form, rather than suggesting anything unclean, nauseating, or repulsive. The colors are fresh and vibrant, not sickly or muted in a way that would imply decay. The forms are abstract and organic, devoid of any figurative elements that could be rendered in a disgusting manner. There is no tactile or olfactory suggestion that would trigger revulsion. Therefore, based purely on visual information and artistic intent, there is absolutely nothing in this piece that registers as disgusting."
flute-passage-1975.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes a feeling of disgust. The artwork consists of a warm, earthy orange-brown background with a series of diagonal, colorful brushstrokes. The colors are vibrant and clean, and the textures, while visible as brushstrokes, do not appear matted, grotesque, or repulsive in any way. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, or any morally reprehensible subjects. The abstract nature of the painting, combined with its simple composition and pleasant color palette, offers no visual cues or thematic elements that would trigger a visceral or emotional reaction typically associated with disgust. The painting is aesthetically neutral or perhaps even calming, certainly not off-putting in the slightest."
evening-glow-1972.jpg,colorField,0.3,"This abstract painting presents absolutely no visual cues or thematic elements that would typically elicit a sensation of disgust. The composition is a rhythmic arrangement of small, block-like forms set against a deep blue background, transitioning in color from warm oranges and reds to cooler whites and purples. There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as repulsive, grotesque, or unhygienic. The color palette, while high in contrast, is vibrant and dynamic, not sickly, jarring, or indicative of decay or corruption. The textures suggested by the brushstrokes or pixelated appearance are visually engaging and ordered, lacking any quality that might evoke a sense of sliminess, grime, or putrefaction. Furthermore, the overall aesthetic does not convey any sense of physical or moral repulsion; instead, it leans towards a mesmerizing or pulsating visual experience. Therefore, any sensation of disgust in response to this artwork would be virtually non-existent, stemming from an extremely idiosyncratic personal aversion rather than any inherent quality of the piece itself."
foley-1967.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke a sense of disgust. The artwork consists of simple, abstract shapes—a red triangle, a dark line, and a light blue rounded rectangle—set against a clean, mustard-yellow background. The colors are clear and distinct, not muddy, decaying, or suggestive of grime or unpleasant substances. The shapes are geometric and non-representational, carrying no inherent meaning or form that could be interpreted as repulsive, offensive, or threatening. The overall composition is clean, balanced, and lacks any visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The surface appears matte and uniform, without textures that might suggest sliminess, stickiness, or any other tactually disgusting quality. Therefore, based on the visual properties of color, form, and composition, there is absolutely nothing present that would elicit the emotion of disgust."
farbraumk-rper-1982.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting is an abstract composition primarily featuring shades of yellow, gold, and earthy green-brown. Disgust is typically evoked by stimuli associated with contamination, decay, filth, bodily effluvia, or moral offense. This artwork contains none of these elements. The color palette, while containing some muted or earthy tones, also incorporates vibrant yellows and golds that prevent it from appearing sickly or putrid. The visible brushstrokes create texture but do not suggest anything physically repulsive or unpleasant to touch (e.g., slimy, sticky, or rotting). There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as disgusting, nor is there any narrative context that would trigger such an emotional response. The overall impression is one of artistic exploration of color and form, which is generally neutral or aesthetically contemplative, rather than repulsive. A very minimal score is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that an individual might find certain muted tones vaguely ""muddy"" or unappealing, but this falls far short of evoking actual disgust."
four-panels-1971.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, featuring four distinct, solid color rectangles (green, black, red, blue) on a white background, contains no visual elements that would typically evoke disgust. Disgust is an emotion often triggered by things that are offensive, repulsive, unclean, or morally repugnant. The colors presented are clear, vibrant, and distinct, without any muddy, sickly, or jarring combinations that might be aesthetically off-putting to that degree. The composition is simple, orderly, and geometric, lacking any chaotic, grotesque, or disturbing forms. There is no representational content that could depict decay, filth, or any other subject commonly associated with disgust. The surface appears smooth and clean. Any minor imperfections visible in the large image (slight variations in paint application or faint marks) are negligible and do not contribute to a sensation of disgust. The overall impression is one of minimalist abstraction, which, while it might elicit other emotions (e.g., calmness, curiosity, or even indifference), does not present anything vile or repulsive. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is virtually absent."
galaxy-1949.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. The color palette, composed primarily of deep maroon or dark red with two vertical brown stripes, is earthy and muted, not reminiscent of anything typically associated with repulsion, such as bodily fluids, decay, or sickeningly clashing hues. The texture, while visible, appears to be that of painted canvas and does not suggest anything slimy, gritty, or otherwise unappealing to the touch. The abstract nature of the composition, with its simple, vertical lines and large color fields, lacks any representational elements that could be considered vile or offensive. There is no chaotic arrangement, jarring contrast, or disturbing imagery that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. The overall impression is one of sobriety and quiet contemplation, rather than anything that would cause one to recoil or feel nauseated. A score slightly above zero is assigned only to acknowledge the theoretical, albeit extremely remote, possibility that an individual might find the very dullness or somberness of the colors aesthetically unpalatable to a minute degree that borders on mild aversion, but this is a far cry from genuine disgust."
gomelza-1965.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This image evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The artwork presents a clean, abstract, and symmetrical pattern composed of red and light blue shapes interlocking on a white background. The lines are fluid and organic, devoid of any sharp, jarring, or chaotic elements that might provoke an unpleasant visceral reaction. The colors are bright and distinct, but not garish or clashing in a way that would be repulsive. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or anything that typically triggers feelings of revulsion or sickness. The composition is orderly and repetitive, contributing to a sense of visual calm rather than disturbance. The overall aesthetic is one of design and balance, far removed from any imagery that would elicit disgust. The fractional score acknowledges the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or associative response, but based on common human perception and the visual characteristics of the artwork, it is entirely non-disgusting."
ghana.jpg,colorField,0.0,"My evaluation yields a score of 0.0 for disgust, indicating an absolute absence of this emotion in response to the painting. Disgust is typically a visceral reaction to something perceived as repulsive, contaminated, or morally objectionable. This painting contains no elements that would trigger such a response. There is no depiction of gore, decay, bodily fluids, or anything physically grotesque. The color palette, dominated by a large field of vibrant red and complemented by softer blues, purples, greys, and greens in the strokes at the bottom, is bold and expressive rather than sickly or unsettling. The abstract nature of the work prevents the interpretation of any figures or scenarios that could be deemed morally repugnant or aesthetically offensive to the point of revulsion. The textures, while visible as brushstrokes, are not chaotic, slimy, or suggestive of putrefaction. Overall, the painting evokes a sense of aesthetic contemplation, energy, or perhaps serenity in its abstract forms and colors, none of which align with feelings of aversion or nausea."
green-giant-1980.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork provides absolutely no visual cues or thematic content that would elicit the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with sensations of revulsion, nausea, or strong moral aversion, often triggered by things perceived as contaminated, decaying, unhygienic, or inherently repulsive. This painting, however, is a clean, abstract composition. The colors are muted greens and deep blacks/blues, which are not jarring, offensive, or reminiscent of anything putrid or unsanitary. The forms are geometric rectangles filled with orderly, though hand-drawn, vertical lines. There are no organic shapes, distorted figures, or disturbing textures that could suggest decay, filth, or any bodily processes. The overall aesthetic is one of minimalist structure and quiet repetition, evoking a sense of calm or contemplation rather than any form of revulsion. Therefore, there is no element within this artwork that would activate a disgust response."
green-painting-2006.jpg,colorField,2.0,"This painting is a monochromatic field of dark green. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with things that are offensive, repulsive, or morally objectionable, often tied to sensations of decay, filth, or something unhygienic. In the context of this painting:
*   **Color:** The dark green color itself does not inherently evoke disgust. While some shades of green can be associated with sickness or decay, this particular hue is deep, earthy, and rather neutral in its emotional resonance for disgust. It doesn't appear putrid or sickly.
*   **Texture and Form:** The painting is abstract, consisting primarily of a flat color field. There are some subtle textural variations, particularly in the lower corners where the paint appears thicker or has slight drips, revealing a hint of an underlying reddish-brown color. These visible marks of the painting process, however, do not come across as unhygienic, decaying, or repulsive. They are part of the artistic application, not indicative of anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion.
*   **Subject Matter:** There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as disgusting. It's an exploration of color and surface.

Overall, there is nothing within the visual elements of this artwork – its color, texture, or composition – that would typically trigger a feeling of disgust. The slight score of 2 acknowledges the extremely remote possibility that a highly idiosyncratic personal association might link this particular shade or slight texture to something unpleasant for a very small fraction of viewers, but it is not a widely or commonly evoked emotion by this image."
il-labirinto-della-psiche-1986.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this piece solely for its capacity to evoke disgust, I find there are no elements whatsoever that contribute to such a feeling. The painting presents an abstract landscape composed of organic, flowing shapes primarily in various shades of green, outlined by light beige or yellow lines. These forms are clean, orderly, and visually harmonious. There are no disturbing textures, no representations of decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, or anything that would typically trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The color palette is earthy and calming, lacking any jarring or unpalatable combinations. The small, scattered dots of color and the abstract black elements at the bottom are graphic and symbolic, not grotesque or offensive. The overall aesthetic is one of serene abstraction, far removed from any imagery that might be considered repulsive or sickening. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent."
hydra-1981.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract composition provides no visual cues that would typically evoke the emotion of disgust. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything inherently repulsive. The colors are muted and earthy, devoid of jarring or sickly hues. While the textures appear somewhat rough or aged, resembling worn paper or distressed surfaces, they do not suggest contamination, slime, or any material that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The faint lines and smudges visible on the lighter sections appear to be part of the material's character or the artist's process, rather than indicative of grime or uncleanliness. The work presents a contemplative, perhaps aged or weathered aesthetic, which does not align with the triggers for disgust, whether physical, moral, or aesthetic in a repellent sense."
glow-ii-1968.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting predominantly features a luminous interplay of warm yellows and oranges with deep blues and purples, creating an atmospheric and largely abstract landscape. There is a notable absence of elements typically associated with disgust, such as grotesque forms, decaying matter, explicit visceral imagery, or colors rendered in a sickly, unappetizing manner. While the central, amorphous brown mass could abstractly suggest an organic form, it lacks the specific characteristics that would make it repulsive, like texture implying rot or disease. Similarly, the fluid application of paints, including some splatters in the lower region, reads as an artistic technique contributing to the painting's dynamism rather than signifying literal grime or bodily fluids. The overall impression is one of expressive color and movement, which does not trigger a sensation of revulsion or strong physical aversion. Any minimal score for disgust would stem only from a very subjective and tenuous association of certain dark, amorphous shapes with an ambiguous organic quality, rather than any direct visual cue designed to provoke such a reaction."
in-croce-iii-1969.jpg,colorField,0.0,"Disgust is an emotion typically associated with revulsion towards things that are perceived as contaminating, unsafe, unclean, decaying, or morally reprehensible. This abstract painting, characterized by its vibrant color blocks, geometric and organic shapes, and a sense of layering, contains absolutely no visual elements that would trigger such a response. The colors are clean and bright, the forms are abstract and do not depict anything resembling bodily fluids, waste, decay, illness, or anything unsanitary or harmful. There is no implied texture that would be repulsive (e.g., slimy, gritty, sticky). The overall aesthetic is one of visual exploration and dynamic composition, devoid of any content that could be interpreted as offensive or repulsive. Therefore, there is no basis to associate this artwork with the emotion of disgust."
infinity-field-lefkada-series-for-c-d-friedrich-1981.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, an abstract composition primarily in shades of blue, purple, and dark grey, offers no visual cues that would trigger a sensation of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual stimuli associated with decay, filth, bodily effluvia, or things perceived as repulsive or contaminated. This artwork, however, presents a palette of deep, cool colors and amorphous shapes that are more suggestive of natural phenomena like geological layers, atmospheric conditions, or abstract emotional states. There are no grotesque forms, jarring and sickly color combinations, or implied textures that might evoke a visceral, repulsive reaction. The lines, while irregular, appear more organic or natural than unsettling or foul. The overall impression is one of calm, depth, or perhaps a meditative quality, entirely devoid of any elements that would register as offensive or stomach-churning to the viewer. A score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the theoretical impossibility of a perfect zero in subjective emotional response, but it effectively communicates the complete absence of disgust."
jasper-s-dilemma-1972.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork, characterized by its precise geometric patterns of concentric squares and striped fills, offers absolutely no visual cues that would trigger a feeling of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with revulsion towards something repulsive, unclean, grotesque, decaying, or morally offensive. The image, conversely, presents a clean, orderly, and abstract composition. The colors in the left square are vibrant and neatly arranged, while the right square maintains a systematic and controlled grayscale palette. There is nothing dirty, chaotic, threatening, or inherently disagreeable in the visual information provided by this painting that could evoke a sensation of nausea, aversion, or moral repugnance. The artwork's deliberate structure and aesthetic focus on form and color relationships preclude any possibility of eliciting disgust."

The palette consists of muted, earthy tones and pastels – including olive green, dark blue, mustard yellow, teal, various greens, and lavender – which are harmonious and visually calming rather than repulsive. There are no forms or textures that could be interpreted as grotesque, decaying, or otherwise sickening. The diffuse, almost misty quality at the edges of the color bands creates a soft, atmospheric effect, entirely devoid of any elements associated with filth, contamination, or anything physically or morally offensive that would typically trigger a sensation of revulsion. The overall impression is one of tranquility and visual balance, completely antithetical to the emotion of disgust."

The artwork is an abstract composition characterized by vibrant, clear colors (red, yellow, blue, purple) in bold, often rectangular or irregular brushstrokes, alongside dynamic black marks and multi-colored splatters. Disgust, as an emotional response, is typically triggered by visual cues associated with contamination, decay, bodily fluids, waste, gore, or things perceived as repulsive, unhygienic, or threatening to one's well-being. None of these elements are present in the painting. The colors are bright and saturated, not sickly or muddied. The textures, implied by the paint application, suggest a lively and energetic process, not anything tactilely unpleasant or revolting. The splatters, while seemingly random, are clearly paint and contribute to the overall dynamic and playful nature of the piece, rather than suggesting filth or organic matter. The abstract forms do not represent any identifiable object or scenario that could trigger a visceral response of revulsion. Therefore, there is no visual information within this artwork that would elicit disgust."
istria-v-2011.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The painting is an abstract composition primarily featuring soft, blended shades of blue, purple, and muted reddish-brown tones. There are no identifiable figures, objects, or narrative elements that could inherently trigger a feeling of disgust. The color palette, while varied, is generally harmonious and atmospheric, not sickly, putrid, or suggestive of decay, contamination, or bodily effluvia. The textural quality, visible particularly in the cropped details, appears to be characteristic of the medium, possibly pigment on a fibrous surface, and does not evoke sensations of grime, filth, or unpleasant tactile experiences. There is nothing depicted or implied within the visual language of this abstract work that relates to spoilage, waste, physical repulsion, or moral repugnance. Any extremely minimal score above zero would only account for the most remote, idiosyncratic, and non-normative association a viewer might conjure, rather than any inherent quality of the artwork itself designed to elicit disgust. The overall impression is one of subtle visual transitions and diffuse forms, far removed from anything that would typically be considered disgusting."
leuchtrot-und-gelb-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork provided, characterized by its vibrant magenta and orange hues and a minimalist, geometric composition, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is typically triggered by sensory input associated with contamination, decay, filth, or moral transgression. This image contains none of these elements. The colors, while highly saturated and bold, are aesthetically vibrant and energetic rather than repulsive or nauseating. The clean lines and abstract nature of the composition preclude any representation of offensive or sickening subject matter. There are no textures or visual patterns that suggest decay, uncleanliness, or anything physically or psychologically repellent. The slight textural variations visible in the crops appear to be a natural characteristic of the printmaking medium rather than a sign of deterioration or grime. Therefore, based on the visual information presented, there is absolutely nothing in this image that would provoke a feeling of disgust."
lure-ii-1976.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is nothing in this painting that evokes disgust. The colors (brown and green) are earthy and natural, lacking any garishness or unsettling combination. The shapes are simple, straight lines and a rounded rectangle, presenting no disturbing or grotesque forms. There is no discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as offensive, repulsive, or unclean. The texture appears to be a flat paint application, without any visual qualities that suggest grime, decay, or anything viscerally unpleasant. The overall impression is one of minimalist abstraction, which is neutral in terms of evoking negative visceral reactions like disgust."
low-white-sun-box-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this abstract painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are repulsive, offensive, unclean, or morally repugnant. This artwork, on the contrary, features a serene and minimalist composition with a large expanse of light, almost white space, a calm blue horizontal band, a small yellow dash, and a light beige lower section with a lighter rectangle. The colors are muted and harmonious (white, cream, light blue, yellow, beige, light grey), none of which are inherently disgusting or combine to form an unpleasant visual sensation. There are no recognizable forms or textures that suggest decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything unhygienic or sickening. The brushwork appears deliberate and clean, and the overall impression is one of tranquility or contemplative simplicity, rather than anything that would induce revulsion. Therefore, based on the visual information presented, there is no basis for a feeling of disgust."
magus-1981.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The emotion of disgust is virtually absent when viewing this abstract painting. The color palette, dominated by warm and muted tones of pink, red, and subtle earthy browns, along with touches of cool blue-grey, does not evoke any sense of revulsion or unease often associated with disgust (such as colors of decay, illness, or grime). There are no discernible shapes or forms that resemble anything inherently repulsive, like bodily fluids, waste, or grotesque figures. The abstract nature of the work means there is no narrative or subject matter that could trigger a feeling of repulsion. The textures, while visible as layers of paint, do not appear unhygienic or unsettling. The composition is structured with nested rectangles and layers, which creates a sense of depth and contemplation rather than discomfort or aversion. The painting is aesthetically benign in its ability to elicit disgust; it presents no visual cues that would trigger such a strong negative reaction. The score is not an absolute 0 only because, in subjective interpretation of art, an infinitesimally small, non-concrete association might be possible for some viewers, but it's essentially negligible."
loves-power-1982.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting is an abstract composition of color blocks with varying textures. It features a bright yellow central shape, a strong red shape below it, and earthy tones of orange, brown, and hints of purple and grey. Disgust is an emotion typically elicited by something repulsive, offensive, unclean, or morally objectionable. None of these qualities are present in this artwork. The colors are vibrant and earthy, without any suggestion of decay, filth, or unpleasant bodily associations. The textures, while visible as brushstrokes and scraped paint, do not convey sliminess, stickiness, or any other quality that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. There is no representational subject matter that could be perceived as disgusting. As an abstract piece, its aesthetic qualities primarily evoke feelings related to color, form, and composition, rather than strong negative visceral emotions like disgust. Therefore, there is no element within the painting that would realistically provoke a feeling of disgust."
maple-grove-2008.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are no elements within this artwork that would elicit a feeling of disgust. The image consists of three monochromatic panels, predominantly in shades of green, displayed against a white background. The colors are natural and soothing, evoking a sense of calm or nature rather than anything repulsive. The composition is clean, orderly, and abstract, lacking any discernible subject matter that could be considered offensive, grotesque, or unhygienic. There are no textures, shapes, or connotations presented that typically trigger a sensation of revulsion, nausea, or profound aversion. The artwork is devoid of anything unsightly, decayed, or morally repugnant, which are common triggers for disgust."
janela-aberta-1998.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, a collection of small abstract paintings, does not elicit any discernible sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically a visceral reaction to something perceived as repulsive, unclean, contaminated, or morally offensive, serving as a protective mechanism against potential harm or violation. These paintings, characterized by their abstract forms, color studies, and visible brushstrokes, do not present any imagery, textures, or subject matter that aligns with these triggers. There are no depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, violence, or any other content commonly associated with eliciting a feeling of revulsion. While a viewer might have other aesthetic preferences or responses (such as indifference or admiration), there is absolutely nothing within the visual information provided by these paintings that would activate a feeling of disgust. The colors, while varied, are not sickly or putrid, and the expressive brushwork, while raw, does not convey a sense of uncleanliness in a manner that would provoke this specific emotion."
medeanus.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting presents a vibrant and harmonious interplay of large, soft-edged color fields. The colors—including bright yellow, deep red, forest green, various blues, and soft grays—are clean, distinct, and visually appealing. The shapes are organic and fluid, creating a sense of gentle movement and visual balance rather than discomfort. There are absolutely no elements within the composition, such as imagery depicting decay, filth, bodily fluids, disturbing textures, or any form of visual abjection, that would typically elicit a response of disgust. The overall impression is one of aesthetic exploration and visual pleasure, completely devoid of any stimuli associated with feelings of revulsion or repulsion."
mohawk-1970.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting, composed of numerous vertical stripes of varying colors, presents no visual elements that would reasonably evoke the emotion of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with things that are offensive, repulsive, noxious, or morally objectionable. The image is a purely abstract composition with an orderly arrangement of lines and a palette of diverse but generally harmonious colors, including blues, greens, grays, purples, reds, and yellows/ochres. There are no forms that resemble anything grotesque, decayed, unhygienic, or physically repellent. The colors themselves are not jarring or clashing in a way that creates visual discomfort or nausea. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, it lacks any representational subject matter that could carry moral or ethical implications capable of eliciting disgust. The overall impression is one of visual neutrality, and for many, potentially calming or aesthetically pleasing, rather than something that would trigger a visceral reaction of repulsion or aversion."
midnight-watch-1976.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork, composed of numerous vertical stripes in varying widths and a palette of blues, greens, greys, yellows, and pinks, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by something offensive, repulsive, unsanitary, grotesque, or morally objectionable. This painting contains none of these elements. The lines are clean and orderly, suggesting precision rather than chaos or decay. The colors, while diverse, are generally harmonious and appear to be applied smoothly, lacking any texture or combination that might be perceived as sickly, muddy, or nauseating. There is no disturbing subject matter, no unsettling imagery, nor any visual cues that would provoke a visceral negative reaction. The abstract nature of the piece, focusing solely on color and line, inherently limits its capacity to elicit strong emotional responses like disgust, as it avoids any figurative or narrative content that could be interpreted as offensive or repulsive. The overall impression is one of visual neutrality, if not calming order, which stands in stark contrast to anything that would cause revulsion."
mother-e-2009.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this piece solely for its capacity to evoke disgust, I find no elements whatsoever that would trigger such a strong negative emotional response. Disgust is typically elicited by stimuli associated with contamination, decay, bodily effluvia, moral transgression, or objects that are inherently repellent or sickening. This artwork, featuring two simple, clean, uniformly colored rectangular panels (one blue, one green) mounted on a plain wall, is entirely devoid of any of these characteristics. The colors are common and not inherently repulsive; the shapes are basic and geometric; and the overall presentation is neat and sterile. There is no depiction of anything grotesque, unhygienic, disturbing, or morally objectionable. The piece is minimalist and abstract, presenting a calm and unchallenging visual experience that does not engage the neural pathways associated with aversion or nausea. Therefore, the degree of disgust elicited is precisely zero."
munich-olympic-games-poster-1972.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The image is an artistic poster for the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, characterized by vibrant, overlapping bands of color in an abstract, dynamic composition. There is absolutely nothing within the visual elements of this artwork that could evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with things that are repulsive, grotesque, unclean, decaying, or offensive to the senses. The colors used are bright and varied, the shapes are fluid and non-threatening, and the overall impression is one of energy and artistic expression, rather than anything unsanitary, vile, or visually unpleasant. The clean lines, bold color choices, and celebratory nature of an Olympic poster are antithetical to any sensation of disgust."
new-morning-1996.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting presents a composition of vibrant, luminous circles against a textured, light-colored background. There are no elements within the artwork that typically trigger a feeling of disgust. The colors are bright and soft-edged, lacking any shades associated with decay, putrefaction, or sickness. The forms are abstract and geometric, devoid of any representation of biological matter, waste, or unsettling figures that might evoke revulsion. While the background has a rough, almost crumpled or heavily impastoed texture, it does not suggest anything soiled, contaminated, or physically repulsive. It appears to be an artistic manipulation of the surface rather than an imitation of something inherently unclean or sickening. There is no narrative or implied context that would lead to moral disgust. The overall aesthetic leans towards the ethereal and luminous, which stands in direct contrast to sensations that typically induce disgust. The score is not an absolute zero, allowing for the infinitesimally small chance that someone might find *any* deviation from a perfectly smooth surface or *any* abstract composition mildly unsettling in a way that very, very remotely touches upon a feeling of aversion, but this is a highly improbable and subjective response not directly supported by the visual cues. Therefore, the feeling of disgust in response to this painting is virtually nonexistent."
nexx-central-revisited-1996.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, with its vibrant blue background and soft, ethereal white brushstrokes, combined with the luminous, glowing circular forms in purple, yellow, and red, evokes feelings far removed from disgust. There are no visual elements that would trigger this emotion. The colors are clean, bright, and harmonious, lacking any muddy, sickly, or decaying tones often associated with revulsion. The forms are abstract and gentle, presenting no grotesque figures, disturbing scenes, or representations of decay, filth, or contamination. The texture created by the visible white brushstrokes appears organic and fluid rather than repulsive or unsanitary. Overall, the composition is visually pleasing and serene, offering no sensory or conceptual input that could lead to a feeling of revulsion or unease."

Disgust is typically triggered by things that are repulsive, offensive, dirty, decaying, or morally objectionable. This painting, composed of large, soft-edged rectangular fields of yellow, off-white, and blue, contains none of these elements. The colors are generally perceived as calming or vibrant, not sickly or putrid. The forms are simple and contemplative, devoid of any disturbing imagery or unsettling textures. As an abstract work, it lacks a representational subject that could be interpreted as disgusting. Therefore, the emotional response to this artwork is entirely disassociated from disgust."
no-2.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, characteristic of Mark Rothko's color field work, consists of soft-edged, luminous rectangular fields of color.

There is nothing within the visual composition—no imagery of decay, bodily fluids, gore, filth, or distorted forms—that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. The colors are not sickly or clashing in a way that would be repulsive. Furthermore, as an abstract work, it lacks any narrative or thematic content that could be interpreted as morally objectionable or offensive. The overall aesthetic is one of serene contemplation and luminosity, which is entirely antithetical to the experience of disgust. Therefore, there are no elements in this artwork that evoke or contribute to a feeling of disgust."
no-24.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The painting, an abstract work by Mark Rothko, elicits virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by imagery that is physically repulsive, grotesque, decaying, or morally offensive. This artwork presents large, soft-edged rectangles of color—a deep, earthy green central block flanked by warm orange and reddish hues, with subtle lighter brushstrokes. There is nothing in the color palette itself that is inherently unpleasant or sickening; in fact, the colors are rich and vibrant. The forms are abstract and geometric, lacking any figural or narrative elements that could be interpreted as disturbing or repulsive. The texture, visible through the brushstrokes and layered paint, appears atmospheric and contemplative rather than harsh or visceral in a negative way. The overall impression is one of visual balance and potential for contemplation, rather than a visceral turning away or a feeling of revulsion. The very low score reflects the profound absence of any visual cues or implied concepts that would trigger a disgust response."
oe-260-1957.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The artwork features a large, smooth, dark, amorphous shape set against a vibrant background that transitions from fuchsia to deep red and orange. The colors are bold and saturated, creating a striking visual, but they do not resemble anything repulsive or sickening. The central form is abstract and organic, yet it possesses no qualities that would elicit a visceral reaction of revulsion; it is not grotesque, decaying, or suggestive of any unsanitary or offensive matter. The composition is clean and balanced, lacking any textures, themes, or implied narratives typically associated with feelings of disgust, such as filth, disease, or bodily unpleasantness. The overall impression is one of visual contemplation and color harmony, completely devoid of any elements that would trigger a negative, stomach-churning response."
oe-280-komposition-in-rot-mit-wei-und-blau-1959.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with visual stimuli that are repulsive, offensive, unclean, or indicative of decay, disease, or moral depravity. This abstract work features broad fields of color—a vibrant red dominating the lower portion, transitioning to a deep, dark brown or black in the middle, and a clean, sharp blue rectangle at the very top. None of these colors, nor their arrangement, texture, or the overall composition, bear any resemblance to common triggers of disgust. There are no grotesque forms, sickly hues, or representations of anything vile or unsanitary. The visual experience is clean and abstract, focusing on color fields and their interactions, which does not align with the emotional response of disgust in any way."
not_detected_242128.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting by Mark Rothko, characterized by its large, soft-edged color fields, evokes a profound lack of any sensation related to disgust. The emotion of disgust is typically triggered by something that is repulsive, offensive to the senses (sight, smell, touch), or morally abhorrent. None of these triggers are present in this artwork.

Firstly, the painting is entirely abstract, meaning there is no discernible subject matter that could depict grotesque figures, decay, bodily fluids, or any other traditionally disgusting objects or scenes. The absence of representational content inherently removes a primary source of disgust in art.

Secondly, the color palette itself — deep purple/blue, luminous yellow/cream, and a warm orange frame — does not evoke any sense of revulsion. These colors, while potentially eliciting feelings of solemnity, warmth, luminosity, or contemplation, do not possess qualities associated with putrefaction, filth, or repulsion. There is nothing visually jarring or sickly in their combination or saturation that would trigger a visceral negative reaction.

Thirdly, the texture and brushwork appear soft, layered, and atmospheric, rather than coarse, slimy, sticky, or otherwise physically unpleasant. The diffused edges and blurred transitions contribute to a sense of etherealness or depth, entirely devoid of tactile qualities that might induce a feeling of uncleanliness or repulsion.

Finally, the contemplative and immersive nature often associated with Rothko's color field paintings typically aims to evoke profound emotional responses related to the human condition, spirituality, or pure aesthetic experience, not revulsion or physical discomfort. There is no element of the composition, scale, or artistic intent that remotely suggests a connection to the emotion of disgust. Therefore, on a scale of 0 to 100, the painting scores a definitive 0 for disgust."
november-1963-iii-1963.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork is an abstract composition characterized by stark, geometric forms and blocks of color: white, a rust-orange, a deep dark brown/black, and a dark blue. There is nothing within the visual elements of this painting that would typically elicit a feeling of disgust. The colors, while earthy and deep in some areas, are not associated with decay, putrefaction, filth, or any bodily fluids or substances that commonly trigger this emotion. The shapes are clean and angular, devoid of any organic, chaotic, or distorted forms that might suggest something repulsive. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, it lacks any discernible subject matter that could be interpreted as morally or physically offensive. The visible texture, appearing to be subtle lines or imperfections in the paint or canvas, contributes to the material quality of the artwork rather than suggesting contamination or decay. The overall impression is one of minimalist structure and color interplay, which falls entirely outside the domain of stimuli known to provoke disgust. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust to this particular image is virtually non-existent."
ohne-titel-for-thomas-merton-1971.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting is an abstract composition primarily featuring large blocks of vibrant orange and deep blue, separated by a thinner red band and a subtle blue line, with a few faint colored lines at the very bottom. There is absolutely nothing in this artwork that could evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are repulsive, offensive, unclean, grotesque, or morally objectionable. This painting contains none of these elements. The colors are bold and clean, the shapes are simple and abstract, and there is no discernible subject matter or narrative that would elicit such a negative visceral reaction. The rough edges of the paper and visible brushstrokes are characteristic of the medium and the artist's technique, not indicators of anything foul or repulsive.

orange-over-violet-1968.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, characterized by its large, soft-edged rectangular fields of color, offers nothing that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The color palette, consisting of muted lavender, golden brown, reddish-brown, and off-white, with a thin black line, is abstract and lacks any representational elements that could be perceived as grotesque, filthy, or morally repulsive. There are no disturbing textures, forms, or subject matter that typically trigger revulsion. The overall impression is one of contemplative abstraction, completely devoid of any visual cues associated with disgust."
orange-red-orange-1961.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This painting elicits virtually no sense of disgust. The color palette, consisting primarily of warm, earthy tones like reddish-orange, ochre, and a subtle golden yellow, is harmonious and visually soothing rather than repulsive. These colors are frequently associated with natural elements such as sunsets, autumn leaves, or warm earth, which are generally perceived as aesthetically pleasing and comforting, not sickening or foul. There is no visual information, such as grotesque imagery, depictions of decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything inherently unpleasant or morally objectionable, that would trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. The soft-edged, expansive color fields contribute to a meditative or contemplative mood, inviting absorption rather than rejection. The abstract nature of the work, devoid of any discernible narrative or concrete subject matter that could be deemed offensive, further prevents any association with feelings of revulsion. The painting's aesthetic qualities are far removed from anything that would evoke a sense of nausea, aversion, or contamination."
peeping-wall-1960.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork, composed of vertical stripes in various colors such as pink, red, light blue, orange, and dark blue, presents no visual information that would elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with encountering something repulsive, offensive, contaminating, or morally objectionable. The image, being an abstract and geometric composition, lacks any representational elements that could be perceived as grotesque, foul, vile, or unpleasant in a way that triggers aversion. The colors are vibrant and clean, the lines are orderly, and the overall aesthetic is one of structured simplicity rather than chaos or decay. There are no disturbing textures, unsavory themes, or unhygienic implications. The artwork is visually benign and aesthetically neutral in terms of evoking negative visceral reactions."
only-orange-1963.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting presents abstract forms and colors that do not inherently trigger sensations of disgust. The prominent orange shape, while irregular and organic with some drips and splatters, does not visually suggest decay, disease, bodily fluids (in a repulsive context), or any other substance or state typically associated with revulsion. Its texture appears more like a watery stain or a spontaneous paint application rather than something putrid or unhygienic. Similarly, the solid red stroke at the bottom is a clear, distinct mark and does not evoke a sense of unpleasantness. The color palette itself, primarily orange and red against a neutral background, consists of warm, vibrant hues that are generally not linked to feelings of disgust. There is no narrative or subject matter depicted that would provoke an emotional response of repulsion or sickness. The overall aesthetic leans towards a study of color and form, making the evocation of disgust highly unlikely."
paisagem-mayor-2009.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within these abstract paintings that could reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things perceived as rotten, contaminated, decaying, unhygienic, or morally repugnant. The artwork consists of abstract compositions of colors and textures, all appearing clean, vibrant, and intentionally arranged. There are no representational forms that could be interpreted as grotesque or repulsive. The colors, while sometimes bold or contrasting, do not mimic anything that would induce revulsion, nor do the brushstrokes or textures suggest anything visceral, slimy, or putrid. The overall impression is purely visual and aesthetic, without any sensory or conceptual cues that would lead to a sensation of nausea, aversion, or strong displeasure associated with disgust."
papier-d-coup-1967.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract composition of diagonal lines in primary and secondary colors on a light background, presents no visual elements that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. There is no representation of decay, filth, bodily fluids, contamination, or any form of physical or moral repugnance. The colors are vibrant and distinct, and while the paint application has a somewhat raw, textured quality (perhaps spray paint or broad brushstrokes), it does not suggest dirtiness or an unhygienic state. The repeated patterns and simple forms are not grotesque or disturbing. The visible segmentation of the background material and fasteners might indicate an assemblage or collage technique, lending a handcrafted or utilitarian aesthetic, but this quality does not trigger any sense of revulsion. The overall impression is one of visual rhythm and color play, entirely devoid of characteristics that would elicit a visceral negative reaction associated with disgust. A score of 0.5 acknowledges the infinitesimally small, almost negligible possibility of an extremely idiosyncratic and non-standard personal reaction, but for all practical purposes, disgust is absent."
pink-flutter-1969.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The image elicits virtually no sense of disgust. The composition is entirely abstract, presenting no recognizable subject matter that could be deemed repulsive, grotesque, or unsanitary. The dominant color palette of vibrant oranges, yellows, and reds conveys warmth, energy, and a luminous quality, more akin to elements like fire, lava, or a sunset, which are generally not associated with feelings of revulsion. The fluid, vertical streaks and irregular blotches, while textural, do not suggest any unpleasant substances, biological decay, or unsanitary conditions. There are no forms or patterns that mimic disease, contamination, or anything inherently sickening. The scattered small dots, though numerous, appear more like subtle textural elements or light reflections rather than anything resembling dirt, grime, or repulsive biological matter. The overall aesthetic is dynamic and somewhat inviting, leading to a complete absence of any physical or psychological aversion."
pocahontas-1978.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting, an abstract composition of vertical stripes in muted and earthy tones (greys, muted greens, and reddish-browns), elicits no discernible feeling of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by stimuli perceived as repulsive, contaminated, unhygienic, grotesque, or morally offensive. The artwork presents none of these characteristics. The color palette is harmonious and subdued, not sickly or jarring. The pattern is orderly and repetitive, offering a sense of calm and visual stability rather than chaos or unpleasant disarray. There are no figures, narratives, or textures that could be interpreted as vile, decaying, or threatening in any way. The clean, structured nature of the piece is antithetical to the typical triggers for disgust, leaving the viewer free from any such aversive emotional response."
pink-stripe-1960.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things that are offensive to the senses, such as filth, decay, contamination, or morally repulsive actions. This abstract composition, consisting of clean, vertical stripes in shades of blue, green, and a narrow pink segment, presents none of these elements. There is no depiction of decay or contamination, no unpleasant textures or forms, and no subject matter that could be interpreted as morally objectionable. The colors are vibrant and clean, and the linear structure is orderly and precise. The image lacks any visual cues that would provoke a visceral or emotional reaction of revulsion or nausea. It is a purely abstract work focusing on color and form, far removed from any common triggers for disgust."
polar-co-ordinates-v-1980.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting is an abstract composition featuring a central, almost pinwheel-like arrangement of organic and arrow-like shapes set against a background of concentric arcs and a grid pattern. The color palette includes muted tones of brown, maroon, teal, green, with accents of yellow and pink. There are no discernible figures, objects, or scenes that are typically associated with triggering the emotion of disgust. The abstract nature of the forms, the choice of colors, and the visible brushstrokes or textures do not convey any sense of decay, filth, grotesque imagery, or anything that would be perceived as inherently repulsive or offensive to the senses. The artwork's aesthetic leans towards a decorative or expressive quality, rather than presenting any visual stimulus that would evoke feelings of revulsion or nausea. Therefore, there is no emotional response of disgust elicited by this particular artwork."
purple-color-field-with-two-green-lines.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting presents an abstract composition dominated by a muted reddish-brown background. Its central elements consist of a distinct, bright green horizontal stroke, beneath which lies a textured area of earthy tones (reds, oranges, browns), further underlined by a thinner, pale yellow line. There are no visual cues within the artwork that are associated with the emotion of disgust. The color palette, while somewhat somber, does not feature combinations or saturation levels that are typically perceived as nauseating or repulsive. The textures appear to be painterly brushstrokes, not suggestive of anything unclean, decaying, or biologically offensive. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the forms depicted prevents any interpretation of subject matter that could be considered disgusting, such as gore, filth, bodily fluids, or anything indicating decay or contamination. The overall aesthetic is one of quiet contemplation rather than a stimulus for revulsion or aversion. Therefore, the painting elicits absolutely no sensation of disgust."
ph-1033-1976.jpg,colorField,0.5,"As an art expert evaluating this painting through the sole lens of disgust, I find its presence to be remarkably minimal, almost negligible. The artwork is characterized by bold, vertical strokes of vibrant red against a soft, light background, interspersed with hints of cream and some earthy tones on the right side. The overall composition is abstract, featuring forms that can be interpreted as energetic flames, upward-reaching plant life, or purely non-representational brushwork.

Disgust, as an emotional response, is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or objects perceived as repulsive or contaminated. This painting offers none of these direct triggers. The red, while a potent color, does not primarily suggest blood in a gory or visceral sense; rather, it conveys dynamism and intensity, perhaps even warmth or passion, akin to fire. The forms are fluid and organic, but lack any grotesque or decaying qualities. There are no explicit depictions of suffering, illness, or waste that would typically elicit a feeling of revulsion.

The minor score of 0.5 is a concession to the highly subjective nature of human emotion and the slight possibility that, for a very small fraction of viewers, the abstract red shapes *could* very faintly and momentarily evoke a fleeting, subconscious association with blood or wounds, which *might* carry a trace of discomfort or aversion. However, this is a speculative and indirect interpretation, not one supported by the primary visual language of the artwork. The painting's aesthetic qualities—its rhythm, color contrast, and gestural marks—do not aim to, nor effectively, produce a sense of disgust. It is far more likely to evoke feelings of energy, contemplation, or even a sense of being overwhelmed by the intensity of color, but not revulsion."
raval-rojo-2004.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this abstract painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork consists of geometric blocks of color – including shades of black, yellow, orange, red, and various browns/grays – arranged in a grid-like pattern. There is no figurative content, no depiction of organic decay, bodily fluids, filth, violence, or any subject matter typically associated with revulsion. The colors, while varied, are not jarring or sickly in a way that would trigger a visceral negative reaction. The visible brushstrokes contribute to the texture and materiality of the paint, but they do not suggest anything unpleasant or repulsive. The overall impression is one of formal composition and color exploration, entirely devoid of elements that would provoke disgust."
painting-1-75-1975.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The painting, an abstract study in deep, earthy brown hues with visible brushwork, elicits a very minimal, almost negligible sense of disgust. The primary color palette, a rich, dark reddish-brown, while somber, does not inherently possess the sickly, decaying, or vibrant tones typically associated with triggers for disgust. It reads more as an organic, grounded color—like soil, rich chocolate, or dark wood—rather than something foul or contaminated. The visible brushstrokes lend a raw, textural quality to the surface, revealing the artist's process and the physicality of the paint. While some might perceive this rawness as unpolished or unrefined, it does not translate into a visceral feeling of aversion or revulsion that defines disgust. There are no disturbing visual narratives, grotesque forms, or unsettling patterns that would actively induce such a strong negative emotional response. Any faint, residual sense of discomfort that could remotely align with disgust might only arise for a viewer with a particularly strong, perhaps idiosyncratic, aversion to dense, unvaried dark tones or very specific, fleeting subconscious associations with certain earthy or bodily fluids, but this is highly speculative and far from a general or intended effect of the artwork.

rb-ps-2-15-1990.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract image, composed of vertical stripes in shades of purple and light grey/off-white, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The colors are muted and rather harmonious, not vibrant or jarring in a way that might overwhelm the senses negatively. There is no offensive subject matter, no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, or anything grotesque or putrid that typically triggers disgust. The texture appears uniform and clean, lacking any tactile qualities that might be repulsive. The composition is simple, orderly, and lacks any chaotic or visually jarring elements that could induce a feeling of aversion. There is nothing within the visual parameters of this artwork that breaches any aesthetic or moral boundary to elicit such a strong negative emotional response as disgust."
red-dog-1961.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract piece, I find absolutely no elements within the composition, color palette, or thematic implications that would evoke disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by imagery associated with decay, filth, bodily fluids, graphic violence, or concepts that are morally repulsive. This painting, however, is a minimalist arrangement of vertical stripes in dark blue, black, red, and lime green. The lines are clean and orderly, the colors are distinct and not inherently jarring or sickening, and there is no representational imagery that could be interpreted as grotesque or offensive. The overall impression is one of visual rhythm, structure, and color contrast, entirely devoid of any qualities that would elicit a visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea. Therefore, a score of 0.0 is warranted."
red-baron-1978.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork consists of two large, rectangular blocks of color – one orange and one red – separated by a thin white vertical line, all enclosed within a light, creamy border. Both colored blocks exhibit a subtle, uniform vertical texture, reminiscent of fine corduroy or laid paper. There is absolutely nothing in this visual presentation that could evoke disgust. The colors are warm, vibrant, and clean, devoid of any association with decay, sickness, or the unpleasant. The texture is regular and orderly, not slimy, gritty, or indicative of something foul. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, it lacks any representational subject matter, such as bodily fluids, gore, decay, or anything conventionally considered repulsive or abhorrent. The composition is simple, balanced, and aesthetically neutral in terms of eliciting a strong negative visceral reaction like disgust."

The artwork is composed of concentric circles formed by small, distinct blocks of color, creating a vibrant and orderly pattern.

There is no representation of anything offensive, repulsive, unhygienic, or morally objectionable. The textures are uniform and visually benign, and the overall composition is abstract, lacking any discernible subject matter that could trigger revulsion. The painting's clean aesthetic and harmonious color arrangement are diametrically opposed to the sensory or moral triggers typically associated with disgust."

Disgust is typically evoked by stimuli that are perceived as offensive, repulsive, nauseating, or morally objectionable, often linked to decay, filth, bodily functions, or distressing social themes. The painting, in contrast, presents a composition of vibrant red, warm orange, and a neutral white, arranged in simple, soft-edged rectangular forms. There is no representational imagery that could be interpreted as grotesque, unhygienic, or morally repugnant. The colors are rich and harmonious, the forms are balanced, and the overall impression is one of calm contemplation rather than revulsion or aversion.

Disgust is typically a visceral reaction to something perceived as contaminated, decaying, unhygienic, morally repugnant, or physically repulsive. This image, however, features clean lines, a bright and uniform red-orange background, and a pure white geometric shape. There are no organic textures suggestive of decay or filth, no muddy or sickly colors, and no thematic content that could be interpreted as offensive or vile. The composition is highly abstract and minimalist, focusing on form and color contrast rather than narrative or realistic depiction that might carry elements capable of provoking revulsion. The visual experience is one of neatness and clarity, entirely devoid of any elements that would trigger a feeling of aversion or nausea. Consequently, the emotion of disgust registers at an almost imperceptible level, practically non-existent in response to this particular painting."

There are no visual elements, textures, or implied narratives within this artwork that could possibly elicit a sensation of disgust. The colors themselves are not inherently repulsive or indicative of decay, filth, or anything physically or morally offensive.

The image, an abstract composition of horizontal stripes by Bridget Riley, presents a harmonious palette of soft, muted colors. The lines are clean and orderly, and the overall aesthetic is one of calm and balanced visual rhythm. There are no jarring color combinations, disturbing textures, or representational elements that could be interpreted as grotesque, unhygienic, or otherwise offensive. The artwork is purely abstract and visually benign, intentionally designed for aesthetic contemplation rather than strong emotional aversion.

There are no elements within the artwork that evoke disgust. The colors, while bold (especially the red), are presented as pure pigments and artistic forms, not as representations of bodily fluids, decay, contamination, or anything inherently repulsive. The shapes are amorphous and organic, lacking any defined features that could be interpreted as grotesque or unsettling. The blending and layering of colors appear deliberate and aesthetically pleasing, suggesting fluidity and depth rather than decay or filth. There is no visual information, such as texture, imagery, or subject matter, that would trigger a visceral or psychological reaction of revulsion or aversion. The overall impression is one of calm, contemplation, or an exploration of color and form, entirely devoid of any unpleasant or offensive qualities that could lead to feelings of disgust."
royal-canoe-1977.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this painting for the emotion of disgust, I find no elements whatsoever within the artwork that could reasonably evoke such a response. Disgust is typically associated with sensations of revulsion, offense, contamination, or moral repugnance. This abstract work, characterized by its precise, vertical stripes and clean color palette, possesses none of these qualities.

The left panel features broad, distinct stripes of deep red, muted gold/tan, and soft lavender. These colors are harmonious and appear clean and vibrant, devoid of any muddy, sickly, or decaying tones that might suggest unpleasantness. The right panel, with its multitude of narrower stripes, introduces a wider array of colors including various shades of blue, pink, white, red, and subtle hints of yellow and green. While the density of these lines creates a different visual rhythm, the colors themselves remain bright, clear, and orderly.

There is no representational content that could be considered disturbing or repulsive. The composition is purely geometric and optical, relying on pattern and color interaction. The execution appears meticulous and precise, not messy or unkempt in a way that might suggest filth or neglect. Even if an individual were to find the aesthetic unappealing or the color combinations not to their personal taste, this falls under aesthetic preference, not the intense visceral reaction of disgust. The artwork presents itself as a clean, structured exploration of line and color, offering nothing that would trigger feelings of nausea, repulsion, or strong aversion."
samba-2005.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The emotion of disgust is minimally, almost negligibly, evoked by this painting. The primary triggers for disgust typically involve visual representations of decay, putrefaction, bodily fluids, gore, disease, waste, or subject matter that is morally repugnant or unhygienic. This abstract painting contains none of these elements. The color palette, composed of a dark, nearly black background and two stark, irregular red shapes, does not inherently convey anything repulsive. While red can be associated with blood, the specific hue used here is a clean, vibrant red, not indicative of coagulated blood, gore, or internal viscera. The shapes themselves are abstract and stylized, lacking any detailed or realistic representation that could trigger revulsion. There are no textures suggesting slime, stickiness, or decomposition. The overall impression is one of starkness or primitive expression, rather than anything that would induce nausea, aversion, or a feeling of contamination. The painting is too abstract and clean in its execution to tap into the common physiological or psychological responses associated with disgust."

Disgust is commonly associated with things that are repulsive, offensive, or sickening, such as decay, bodily fluids, graphic violence, or morally repugnant themes. This artwork, however, features a dominant field of warm, earthy reddish-orange, a color palette that is vibrant and inviting rather than sickly or putrid. The texture, while visible and painterly, does not suggest anything slimy, grimy, or grotesque; rather, it speaks to the material quality of paint on canvas. The subtle, almost etched lines are geometric and abstract, carrying no narrative or representational content that could be deemed offensive or unsettling. There is nothing in the composition, color, or perceived texture that is ugly in a repulsive way, threatening, or otherwise capable of eliciting a visceral reaction of aversion. The painting is abstract and meditative, focusing on the sensory experience of color and subtle form, an experience entirely devoid of anything that could be considered vile or repulsive."
saraband-1959.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting presents an abstract composition characterized by vertical, blended strokes of various colors, including browns, greens, oranges, purples, and blues. Disgust is an emotion typically elicited by visual stimuli associated with contamination, putrefaction, revulsion, or inherently offensive or unclean elements. In evaluating this artwork for disgust, there are very few visual cues that align with these triggers. The colors, while encompassing earthy tones, are generally well-blended and harmonious; they do not appear sickly, festering, or indicative of decay. The texture is fluid and somewhat translucent, lacking any lumpy, slimy, or grotesque qualities that would typically provoke a feeling of revulsion. There is no discernible subject matter that is inherently offensive or disturbing. The abstract nature of the piece avoids depicting anything concrete that might be interpreted as contaminated or repulsive. While an individual might find certain color combinations or the overall mutedness less aesthetically pleasing, this aesthetic preference does not translate into the visceral reaction of disgust. The visual information does not suggest uncleanliness, threat, or any form of degradation that would typically elicit such a strong negative emotional response. The score reflects a near absence of disgust, accounting only for the extremely remote possibility of an individual associating the deepest, most muted browns with a very generalized, abstract notion of 'muddiness' or 'uncleanliness,' which is still far removed from a true feeling of disgust."

There are no representational elements, figures, objects, or narratives that could conceivably trigger a sensation of revulsion or distaste. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, contamination, physical unpleasantness, or moral repugnance. This artwork, with its clean lines, flat fields of color, and orderly arrangement, offers no such stimuli. The palette, while varied, includes both bold and softer tones, none of which are inherently jarring or aesthetically offensive in a way that would induce a visceral negative reaction. The overall impression is one of formal exploration rather than any content that could be perceived as repulsive or sickening. Therefore, based on the visual information presented, there is no basis for an emotional response of disgust."

There are no depictions of decay, bodily fluids, offensive textures, or anything that would induce a sense of revulsion or a desire to withdraw. The colors themselves, while strong and contrasting, are not inherently nauseating. The brushstrokes, though visible, do not suggest unpleasantness or contamination. As an abstract composition, its visual language does not convey any form or narrative that could be interpreted as grotesque or repulsive. Therefore, there is no sensory or conceptual input within the artwork that would evoke a feeling of disgust."
segwehce-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"Disgust is a primal emotion typically triggered by something perceived as offensive, repulsive, or contaminating, often associated with a strong aversion or revulsion. When evaluating this painting for any sense of disgust, I find an absolute absence of elements that would elicit such a response. The artwork presents a series of five clean, horizontal stripes in solid colors: green, blue, red, purple, and yellow. These colors are vibrant and common, carrying no inherent negative connotations that would provoke a visceral feeling of revulsion. There is no discernible subject matter that could be considered repulsive, unsanitary, or morally offensive; the painting is purely abstract, composed of basic geometric forms and flat color fields. The orderly, simple composition offers a visually benign and non-threatening aesthetic. There are no jarring or sickly color combinations that might induce a feeling of nausea or discomfort akin to disgust. Furthermore, the surface appears flat and clean, devoid of any textures that might suggest sliminess, grittiness, decay, or other tactile qualities typically associated with disgust. The painting completely lacks the visual cues—such as signs of decay, illness, filth, gore, or grotesque distortions—that are commonly linked to the activation of the disgust response. Its clean lines, bright palette, and minimalist approach position it far from anything that would be considered offensive or revolting."

There is nothing within the visual elements of this painting—such as subject matter, texture, color combinations, or composition—that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is an emotion generally associated with revulsion towards things that are offensive, repulsive, or perceived as contaminated, decaying, or morally objectionable.

Disgust is typically triggered by sensory input that signifies decay, contamination, disease, or moral repugnance. This artwork presents neither. The colors, predominantly a rich red and a warm, luminous yellowish-white, are vibrant and harmonious, devoid of any sickly or decaying tones. The forms are simple and geometric, lacking any grotesque, distorted, or unsettling qualities. The texture, while painterly and varied, does not suggest anything tactilely unpleasant or repellent. There is no narrative or representational content that could be interpreted as morally offensive or vile. The overall effect of the painting is one of contemplative immersion in color and light, aiming to evoke profound emotional and spiritual responses rather than any form of revulsion or repulsion.

silvio-set-one-1963.jpg,colorField,8.0,"The painting, being abstract, does not depict any identifiable subject matter that would inherently provoke disgust, such as decay, filth, or gore. The predominant colors are vibrant blues, yellows, and reds on a clean white background, which typically evoke energy and dynamism rather than revulsion. There's nothing murky, sickly, or overtly repulsive about the palette.

However, a *very subtle* and almost negligible level of disgust might be conjured by a few elements, primarily due to subconscious associations. The organic, somewhat amorphous blue shapes, particularly the winding, rounded forms in the top right, could be *very loosely* interpreted as resembling internal organs or viscera (like intestines), which for some individuals might trigger a fleeting, visceral sense of unease or mild somatic reaction. Additionally, the chaotic splatters and drips of various colored paints, while energetic, could be perceived by some as messy, uncontrolled, or even reminiscent of bodily fluids or waste, thus evoking a faint sense of aversion to disorder or perceived 'uncleanliness'. These interpretations are highly subjective and tenuous, as the work is clearly paint on canvas and not a realistic depiction. Therefore, any feeling of disgust would be extremely minimal, fleeting, and not the primary emotional response to the artwork."

Disgust is an emotion typically associated with revulsion, strong aversion, or a feeling of being soiled or contaminated. The colors, which range from vibrant reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and blues to more earthy browns and soft pinks, are presented clearly and distinctly. There is no muddiness, decay, or unsettling visual texture that might trigger a visceral negative reaction. The orderly, repetitive nature of the stripes, while potentially monotonous to some, does not convey any subject matter or aesthetic quality that could be considered repulsive, offensive, or sickening.

The colors are vibrant and generally perceived as aesthetically pleasing, particularly the range of blues, and the warm orange and yellow. There are no disturbing or repulsive subjects, no gore, decay, or unhygienic imagery.

The visible texture appears to be that of painted paper or a similar material, with naturally torn or rough edges, which conveys a handcrafted or raw aesthetic rather than something unhygienic or contaminated.

This abstract composition, characterized by its clean lines, stark color contrasts, and geometric precision, presents none of these qualities. The large field of vibrant red, while intense, functions purely as a color block and does not suggest gore, decay, or any visceral unpleasantness. Similarly, the pristine white space and the sharp, deliberate black lines create an impression of order and clarity, rather than chaos, filth, or anything unsanitary. There are no figurative elements, narratives, or implied textures that would trigger a feeling of revulsion.

There is nothing in the visual composition, color palette, or subject matter of this abstract image that would elicit a sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by stimuli that are offensive, repulsive, putrid, contaminated, or morally objectionable. The colors are generally soft and harmonious, the lines are clean and orderly, and the overall impression is neutral or even somewhat soothing. There are no elements present that suggest decay, filth, bodily fluids, unpleasant textures, or any other common visual cues associated with revulsion. The image is entirely benign and lacks any characteristic that would provoke a feeling of nauseated aversion or strong disapproval."
untitled-1953.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, an abstract work characterized by bold, thick impasto strokes and vibrant colors (red, yellow, green, blue, white, black), elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by something repulsive, offensive, sickening, or morally repugnant. This artwork contains none of these qualities. There are no grotesque figures, disturbing narratives, unpleasant subject matter, or imagery associated with decay, filth, or harm that would evoke revulsion. The colors, while strong and assertive, are not sickly or off-putting. The tactile quality of the paint, though very pronounced and textured, does not translate into anything physically or aesthetically disgusting; instead, it speaks to the energetic application of the medium. The abstract nature means there are no discernible objects that could be interpreted as vile. The overall impression is one of raw artistic energy and a play of color and form, far removed from any sensation of revulsion or distaste."
untitled-1957.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The emotion of disgust is fundamentally linked to a visceral aversion to things perceived as offensive, repulsive, or contaminated, often evoking feelings of nausea, revulsion, or strong disapproval. When evaluating this abstract painting for disgust, there is virtually no visual information that would trigger such a response. The work features vibrant, energetic splashes and drips of color—primarily yellow and blue, with accents of red and orange—on a light background. These are pure, artistic applications of paint. There is no representation of decay, filth, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or any other subject matter typically associated with disgust. The forms are abstract and non-representational, preventing any interpretation that might lend itself to repulsive imagery. While some might find the chaotic nature or dripping paint aesthetically unappealing, this does not equate to disgust, which is a much stronger, often physiological, reaction to something truly foul or sickening. The slight score of 0.5 acknowledges the *absolute minimum* theoretical possibility that an individual might have an idiosyncratic, extremely rare personal aversion to certain color combinations or dynamic compositions that *could* be interpreted negatively, but this is highly improbable and not inherent to the artwork itself. The painting's essence is one of movement, color, and abstract expression, entirely devoid of elements that would naturally provoke revulsion."
untitled-1959-1.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting, characterized by a dominant orange, somewhat oval-shaped form set against a deep blue border, offers no visual cues or thematic content that would elicit a sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically a visceral reaction to things perceived as unclean, decaying, harmful, or morally repugnant. The artwork contains none of these elements. The colors used are vibrant and contrasting (orange and blue), which are not inherently repulsive or associated with decay. The shapes are abstract and organic, but do not resemble anything foul, grotesque, or unhygienic. While there are some visible paint splatters and variations in texture, these are clearly artistic marks and do not suggest filth, bodily fluids, or any other matter that would trigger a feeling of revulsion. The overall impression is one of bold color and form, entirely devoid of any features commonly associated with or capable of provoking disgust."
untitled-1949-1.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting by Mark Rothko, characterized by its large, contemplative color fields, offers no visual elements that would typically evoke the emotion of disgust. Disgust is generally triggered by stimuli associated with contamination, decay, bodily fluids, gore, or aesthetically jarring and repulsive combinations. This artwork presents none of these qualities.

The colors used – vibrant red, various shades of green, dark brown, and subtle pink/yellow – are arranged in distinct, soft-edged rectangles. While colors can influence mood, none of these specific hues or their juxtapositions are inherently associated with revulsion or a sense of sickness. There is no representation of anything literally or symbolically offensive, unclean, or decaying. The texture is painterly but does not mimic anything visceral or repugnant. As an abstract composition, it lacks any narrative or figural content that could depict morally or physically disgusting scenes. The overall impression is one of contemplative color interaction rather than anything that would trigger aversion or nausea."
untitled-1959.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this abstract piece, I find absolutely no elements within the painting that evoke the emotion of disgust. The dominant visual is a vibrant, almost energetic orange field, flanked by areas of mottled grey-blue. These colors are clean, distinct, and do not possess the sickly, putrid, or decaying qualities often associated with visually disgusting stimuli. Furthermore, the texture apparent in the brushstrokes or application of paint does not suggest anything physically repulsive; it appears to be a natural characteristic of the medium, rather than resembling slime, rot, decay, or any unhygienic matter. There are no identifiable forms, symbols, or narratives within this abstract composition that could possibly trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea. The painting presents itself as a study in color and texture, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would align with or provoke feelings of disgust."
untitled-1962-1.jpg!PinterestLarge.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the painting solely through the lens of disgust, I find no elements whatsoever that would evoke this emotion. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily fluids, moral repugnance, or deeply offensive imagery. This painting, however, presents none of these characteristics. Its composition is clean, orderly, and abstract, featuring vertical stripes in vibrant shades of blue, turquoise, and red-orange. The lines are crisp, the colors are bright and unblemished, and the overall effect is one of visual harmony and precision. There is no representational content that could be interpreted as repulsive, grotesque, or morally objectionable. The geometric abstraction and the controlled use of color and line create an aesthetic experience that is stimulating and visually engaging, rather than arousing any sense of revulsion or aversion. Therefore, the feeling of disgust is completely absent in response to this artwork."
untitled-1952.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting primarily uses deep, rich tones of red, maroon, and brown, with stark contrasts of black and hints of lighter, almost metallic shades. While the color red can, in some contexts, be associated with blood or visceral elements, the way it is applied here – with thick, vertical brushstrokes creating a textured, almost layered effect – does not specifically evoke disgust. It appears as paint on a canvas, expressive and abstract, rather than a literal depiction of anything grotesque, decaying, or unsanitary. There are no recognizable forms of rot, disease, waste, or gore that would trigger a strong sense of revulsion. The aesthetic is one of raw texture and intense color, which might evoke feelings of power, depth, or even unease, but not a visceral reaction of disgust. The minor score is only allocated to acknowledge the extreme possibility of a viewer associating the deep red with dried blood or organic matter in a very abstract and subjective interpretation, but this is not the dominant or intended feeling conveyed by the artwork's formal qualities."
untitled-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this artwork that elicits a feeling of disgust. The composition, featuring a symmetrical arrangement of abstract, interconnected shapes in clear red and blue tones against a neutral background, is clean, ordered, and aesthetically benign. Disgust is typically evoked by something physically repellent, morally offensive, or viscerally disturbing – such as decay, contamination, or grotesque imagery. This painting, however, presents a harmonious and almost playful abstract design. The shapes, while organic in feel, are highly stylized and devoid of any suggestion of illness, bodily fluids, or anything unhygienic. The colors are vibrant and clean, not murky or suggestive of putrefaction. The overall impression is one of visual simplicity and balance, rather than anything that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or aversion."
untitled-1960.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting is an abstract composition featuring three horizontally elongated, somewhat oval-shaped blocks of color stacked vertically against a plain white background. The colors, from top to bottom, are a muted orange or terracotta, a deep maroon or burgundy, and a very dark purple or almost black. There is absolutely nothing in this artwork that evokes feelings of disgust. The colors are earthy and rich, not sickly, decaying, or unappetizing. The forms are simple and non-representational, carrying no inherent associations with anything vile, repulsive, or morally objectionable. The brushstrokes are visible but not jarring or textured in a way that would suggest putrefaction or an unpleasant tactile sensation. The composition is orderly and balanced, presenting a serene and contemplative visual experience rather than one that is unsettling or offensive. There are no elements of gore, decay, unsanitary conditions, or any form of visual or conceptual unpleasantness that would trigger a sensation of disgust."
untitled-1967.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork is an abstract composition featuring vertical bands of color in various shades of orange, terracotta, and peach. There are no discernible elements within the painting—such as form, subject matter, texture, or specific color combinations—that are typically associated with feelings of revulsion, offense, or contamination. The colors used are warm and earthy, generally considered aesthetically pleasant or neutral, and the overall impression of the piece is one of tranquility and visual harmony, rather than anything that might trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. There is nothing unsanitary, grotesque, or unappealing in its visual presentation that would evoke this emotion."
untitled-1962.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork elicits no discernible feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with elements that are offensive, repulsive, or inherently unpleasant, often evoking a visceral reaction related to decay, contamination, bodily fluids, or extreme aesthetic ugliness that repels the viewer. The painting, an abstract composition featuring a solid, vertically oriented red/orange rectangle on a plain, light cream background, contains none of these triggers. The colors are vibrant and clean, not sickly or decaying. The form is simple and geometric, devoid of any grotesque or disturbing imagery. While the brushstrokes are visible and the edges of the rectangle are not perfectly sharp, this texture and application convey a handmade quality rather than suggesting sloppiness, filth, or any condition that would provoke revulsion. There is no implication of decay, contamination, or any subject matter that would be considered offensive or repugnant. The overall impression is one of minimalist composition and color study, which may evoke feelings of calm, energy, or contemplation, but certainly not disgust."
untitled-1969-2.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting presents vibrant colors, primarily reds and oranges, with subtle undertones of blues and purples where layers overlap. The composition consists of broad, translucent strokes, creating a sense of depth and light. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things perceived as contaminated, offensive, rotten, or biologically revolting. It is associated with visual stimuli such as gore, decay, filth, or certain bodily substances, or concepts considered morally repugnant.

In this artwork, there are no discernible elements that align with these triggers. The colors are bright and energetic, not sickly or putrid. The forms are abstract and non-representational, without any hint of grotesque figures, decaying matter, or anything that could be interpreted as unclean or repulsive. The implied texture is smooth and layered, not slimy, gritty, or otherwise unpleasant. There is no narrative or symbolic content that suggests a morally offensive situation. The overall impression is one of visual energy and harmonious layering of color, entirely devoid of any qualities that would induce a feeling of revulsion or nausea. Consequently, it elicits no response of disgust."
untitled-1984.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements perceived as repulsive, contaminated, grotesque, or morally offensive. The artwork is an abstract geometric composition, characterized by clean lines, distinct blocks of color (orange, mustard yellow, grey, lavender, and teal), and a visible but uniform canvas texture. There are no discernible subjects, narratives, or visual cues that could be interpreted as decaying, unsanitary, violent, or disturbing in any way. The colors, while varied, are not sickly or jarring in a manner that would induce revulsion. The overall impression is one of order, design, and visual exploration, rather than anything that would prompt a visceral feeling of aversion or nausea."
untitled-1971.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The painting, being largely abstract with a minimalist composition, does not inherently possess visual elements that typically trigger disgust. The predominant reddish-purple hues and the central vertical line do not depict anything conventionally repulsive such as decay, bodily fluids, filth, or grotesque forms. The textures are painterly and blend into the background, lacking any tactile quality that would induce a sensation of revulsion.

However, a very slight, almost negligible, potential for discomfort that *could* be loosely interpreted as touching upon the fringes of disgust arises from the central line's appearance. Its reddish-brown color and somewhat irregular, streaky texture could, for some, very faintly evoke the appearance of dried blood, rust, or an old, decaying mark on a surface. This is a highly subjective and weak association, as the line is abstract and lacks any specific context to reinforce such an interpretation. It is not graphic, visceral, or clearly indicative of contamination or decay. The overall aesthetic is more meditative or stark than repulsive. Thus, any feeling of disgust is extremely minimal and likely only conjured by a very loose, abstract association with a few of the visual qualities of the central line, rather than a direct, strong, or intended evocation."
untitled-1985-1.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this abstract painting that evoke a sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues related to decay, contamination, uncleanliness, bodily fluids, gore, or morally reprehensible acts. This artwork, however, is comprised of clean, precise geometric shapes and vertical lines in a controlled and orderly composition. The colors are distinct and arranged neatly, and the surfaces appear smooth and unblemished. There is nothing visually chaotic, jarring, offensive, or physically repulsive about the artwork that would elicit an emotional response of disgust. The aesthetic is one of order, clarity, and minimalist design, which is antithetical to the sensation of disgust."
untitled-brown-violet-2001.jpg,colorField,7.5,"The emotion of disgust is very minimally evoked by this painting. While there are no explicit elements that are inherently revolting or unhygienic, certain textural qualities and color variations could, for some viewers, lean towards an association with something unpleasant. The broad brown strokes, particularly in their varied shades and mottled appearance, occasionally resemble dried mud, streaky grime, or aged, stained surfaces. There are areas where the brown appears somewhat congealed or a bit messy, and the very dark, almost black patch at the top center could be vaguely interpreted as a mark of decay or impurity. However, these are very subtle suggestions, and the overall impression is more of abstract texture and earthy tones rather than anything truly putrid, foul, or inherently disgusting. The vibrant purple lines, in fact, provide a contrasting clean and structured element that actively works against any sense of revulsion, making any feeling of disgust extremely minor and subjective."
untitled-1974.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The emotion of disgust is virtually absent in response to this painting. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, putrefaction, contamination, unhygienic conditions, or offensive subject matter that evokes a sense of revulsion or strong disapproval. This artwork, however, presents vibrant, fluid splashes of color – reds, oranges, yellows, blues, and purples – on a predominantly clean white background. The spontaneous nature of the ink or paint bleeding and splattering, while appearing ""messy"" or uncontrolled, does not translate into anything inherently repulsive or unclean. Instead, it suggests an energetic, organic process of creation. There are no murky, nauseating colors, no unpleasant textures, nor any forms that could be interpreted as decaying or offensive. The overall impression is one of lively abstraction and artistic experimentation, rather than anything that would evoke a visceral feeling of revulsion or strong displeasure. The score of 0.5 is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic response, but objectively, the painting contains no elements commonly associated with triggering disgust."
untitled-1995.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, composed of numerous thin, vertical lines in varying shades of light green, blue, and off-white, evokes no discernible sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, contamination, unsanitary conditions, bodily fluids, or morally repulsive subjects. This artwork, being abstract, lacks any representational elements that could conjure such sensations. The color palette is composed of cool, light tones that are generally perceived as calming or neutral, far removed from colors often associated with sickness or putrefaction. The repetitive, ordered, and somewhat rhythmic nature of the lines creates a visual texture that is clean and structured, rather than chaotic, grotesque, or unsettling. There are no forms or compositional choices that suggest anything offensive, unclean, or viscerally repulsive. The overall impression is one of visual simplicity and perhaps meditative quality, entirely devoid of any characteristics that would incite revulsion or strong aversion."
untitled-gray-and-mauve-1969.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting, composed of two large, muted color fields – a greyish-purple above and a brownish-pink below – offers no visual cues that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is an emotion commonly triggered by sensory input related to decay, filth, bodily effluvia, or things that are inherently repulsive or corrupted. The colors used here, while somber and subdued, do not resemble anything putrid, diseased, or otherwise objectionable. The smooth, contemplative nature of the color fields and the minimalist composition offer no forms, textures, or implied narratives that could be interpreted as grotesque, sickening, or repulsive. There is an absence of any elements associated with revulsion, making the score for disgust effectively zero."
untitled-i-2000.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, an abstract composition of two vibrant color fields—a bright red above and a striking orange below—does not evoke any sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically associated with visceral aversion to something perceived as contaminated, decaying, morally repugnant, or physically repulsive. This image contains no elements that could trigger such a response. The colors are clean, strong, and visually stimulating, devoid of any hue or texture that might suggest unpleasantness, decay, or a lack of hygiene. The brushstrokes, while visible, are part of the artistic technique and do not imply anything slimy, putrid, or otherwise off-putting. The simple, non-representational form offers nothing that could be interpreted as offensive or stomach-churning. The overall impression is one of visual energy and artistic balance, entirely devoid of characteristics that would elicit a feeling of revulsion."
untitled-february-26-1964.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this image, warranting a very low score. The primary elements that might, on a subconscious and highly abstract level, relate to disgust are the shapes and color. The shapes possess a somewhat organic, almost ""drippy"" quality at their extremities, which can, in certain contexts, be associated with viscous fluids, blood, or semi-solid organic matter. Similarly, the reddish-brown hue, while earthy and muted, could very faintly allude to bodily substances or internal organs if interpreted with an extremely negative bias.

However, several factors significantly counteract any potential for disgust. The shapes are highly stylized and symmetrical, appearing more like decorative motifs or abstract symbols rather than literal representations of anything repulsive. They are clearly defined and isolated on a clean, light background, devoid of any messy textures, signs of decay, contamination, or unsanitary conditions. The overall composition is balanced and orderly, presenting a sense of design rather than chaotic unpleasantness. There is no visual indication of foul odors, unappetizing textures (like sliminess or stickiness), or any clear association with disease, waste, or decomposition. The forms lack the grotesque, distorted, or putrefying qualities typically associated with strong feelings of disgust. Any association with repulsive elements is extremely indirect and requires a significant leap of interpretation, which is unlikely to be a common or dominant reaction to this abstract artwork."
untitled-in-5-parts-1987.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The emotion of disgust is primarily triggered by things perceived as unclean, contaminated, putrid, morally offensive, or aesthetically repulsive in a visceral way (e.g., gore, waste, decay). Examining the provided image, which consists of several abstract color-field paintings, there are virtually no elements that would elicit such a strong negative reaction. The paintings feature simple horizontal divisions of color. The colors used – various shades of grey, blue, brown, white, yellow, green, orange, and dark blue – are common pigments and do not, individually or in combination, appear sickly, putrid, or inherently repulsive. There is no representational subject matter that could be deemed disgusting, nor are there any textures that suggest slime, decay, or other tactile qualities typically associated with disgust. The painterly quality, while visible, does not convey anything foul or unpleasant. The aesthetic is clean, minimalist, and focuses on color relationships rather than evoking a visceral response of revulsion. Any score above zero would only account for the extremely remote possibility of an idiosyncratic or associative reaction, as the visual information itself provides no basis for disgust."
untitled-1989-2.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The emotion of disgust is minimally provoked by this artwork, resulting in an exceptionally low score. There are virtually no elements within the painting that would typically trigger a visceral feeling of revulsion or aversion. The vibrant colors—yellow, red, turquoise, with hints of orange and pink—are generally perceived as energetic and lively, rather than unpleasant or repulsive. The abstract nature of the forms, which appear to be created through pouring, dripping, and splattering paint, lacks any representational subject matter that could be inherently disgusting, such as decay, filth, or bodily fluids. While the application technique might be perceived by some as ""messy"" or chaotic, this typically evokes aesthetic preferences or a desire for order, not a strong emotional response of disgust, which implies a sense of contamination or offensiveness. The textures are those of paint, which is a clean and common artistic medium. Any extremely faint, almost negligible sensation of disgust would likely stem from a highly individual and idiosyncratic aversion to certain textures (e.g., the perceived viscosity or clumping of paint) or a very strong preference for extreme tidiness, where the splatters might be perceived as a form of visual disorder. However, these are highly unlikely and marginal interpretations, as the painting's overall impression is one of dynamic abstract expression rather than anything vile or repulsive."
untitled-no-114-2002.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this image that evokes a feeling of disgust. The artwork is an abstract textile pattern, characterized by vibrant colors (red, blue, black, and white/cream) and irregular, somewhat organic shapes arranged in vertical stripes. These colors are bold and distinct, not murky, faded, or combined in a way that suggests decay, illness, or unhygienic conditions. The shapes themselves are purely abstract, not resembling any form that would typically trigger a visceral or moral sense of revulsion, such as bodily fluids, waste, vermin, or grotesque imagery. The visible texture appears to be that of a woven fabric, which, while showing some signs of age or wear consistent with a textile, does not convey dirtiness, contamination, or a repulsive tactile quality. The overall composition is decorative and repetitive, presenting a visual experience that is neutral or aesthetically engaging rather than offensive or sickening. Therefore, no degree of disgust is elicited."
untitled-no-30-1996.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting presents an abstract composition with a vibrant red background adorned with a repetitive pattern of black-outlined, somewhat irregular shapes. Scattered across this pattern are amorphous forms in white, yellow, and dark green. There is very little in this artwork that would elicit a feeling of disgust. The colors, while strong (red), are not inherently associated with repulsive themes like gore or decay; rather, they contribute to a lively or bold aesthetic. The shapes are abstract and organic, but they do not depict anything grotesque, unsanitary, or inherently offensive to the senses. There are no elements that suggest contamination, rot, disease, or any other common visual triggers for disgust. The overall impression is more decorative, energetic, or visually engaging, lacking any features that would provoke a visceral, negative, or aversive reaction. A very low score is given primarily because absolute zero is difficult to achieve for any emotional response to art, and some individuals might have an idiosyncratic, mild aversion to certain abstract forms or strong colors if they found them jarring, but this is highly unlikely to register as genuine disgust."
untitled-no-184-2001.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The painting elicits a very minimal sense of disgust, primarily stemming from subtle visual cues that might be interpreted as a lack of pristine cleanliness or a slight sense of dilapidation. The striped fabric portions, particularly at the top and sides, exhibit minor white specks and what appears to be faint discoloration or wear, suggesting an object that is not entirely new or spotless. While this hints at age or extensive use, it stops far short of conveying genuine filth or decay. Similarly, the painted central area, while vibrant, has an uneven, somewhat coarse texture, and there are very faint, possibly smudged or soiled, areas within the light green sections at the bottom. These minor imperfections in the paint application and the slightly worn appearance of the fabric elements might trigger a fleeting, almost imperceptible feeling of aversion for those who are particularly sensitive to visual representations of grime or lack of polish. However, there is no imagery that remotely suggests bodily fluids, decay, contamination, or any other traditionally disgust-inducing subject matter. The abstract shapes and bright colors are largely innocuous, and any discomfort felt is extremely mild and fleeting, more akin to noticing a minor stain on an otherwise interesting garment than encountering something truly repulsive."
untitled-red-and-orange-on-salmon-1969.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting, characteristic of Mark Rothko's color field work, elicits no discernible feeling of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual stimuli that are perceived as repulsive, sickening, unclean, putrid, or fundamentally offensive. The artwork, however, presents large, luminous fields of warm, inviting colors – a deep reddish-orange and a rich orange – set against a subtly contrasting background of a similar palette. The composition is serene and balanced, featuring soft, merging edges that create a sense of ethereal depth rather than harshness or unpleasantness. There are no disturbing textures, sickly hues, chaotic forms, or representational elements that could trigger a sensation of revulsion or aversion. The painting's aesthetic qualities lean towards contemplation, warmth, and visual harmony, making a response of disgust entirely incongruous with its visual language and emotional intent."
untitled-for-cool-series-1960.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting is an abstract composition dominated by large, bold blocks of black and red, with a central horizontal band of a pale pink-purple hue interrupted by a vertical black element. Disgust, as an emotional response, is typically triggered by stimuli associated with contamination, decay, unsanitary conditions, or things perceived as repulsive or aversive. When evaluating this painting for disgust, there are very few, if any, discernible elements that directly or strongly evoke such a feeling. The colors, while creating strong contrasts (deep black, vibrant red, and light pink), do not inherently suggest decay, illness, or putrefaction. While red can sometimes be associated with blood, its abstract and flat application here does not convey gore or a visceral sense of bodily fluids. The pale pink band contains a few scattered, small dark specks and lines; these could, through a highly subjective and charitable interpretation, be perceived as minor blemishes or traces of dirt. However, these marks are minimal, abstract, and lack the clear visual cues (such as texture, volume, or context) to strongly convey contamination or filth. The rough, textured quality of the paint and the seemingly torn edges of some abstract shapes contribute to a raw or expressive aesthetic but do not inherently lean towards qualities that would induce disgust. There are no depictions of waste, rot, or grotesque forms. Any potential feeling of disgust derived from this artwork would be extremely faint, highly subjective, and largely a result of a fleeting and unconfirmed interpretation of very subtle marks as 'unclean' rather than a direct, visceral response to the overall composition or its intended subject matter. The painting is primarily concerned with form, color, and texture, not with eliciting revulsion."
untitled-sfe-020-lembark-i53-1984.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract artwork presents no discernible elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The vibrant and varied color palette, while energetic and somewhat chaotic in its splattered application, does not convey anything akin to filth, decay, gore, or any other traditionally offensive or repulsive visual content. There are no grotesque forms, disturbing themes, or unpleasant textures implied that might trigger a visceral sensation of revulsion. The overall impression is one of spontaneous artistic expression and visual dynamism, entirely devoid of any characteristics that would lead to a sensation of strong aversion or nausea."
untitled-sfm66-03-1966.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this image that evokes a sense of disgust. The artwork consists of abstract colorful borders around a clean, white central space. The colors (predominantly reds, blues, and some lighter tones) are vibrant and appear to be fluid, perhaps watercolor or ink, creating soft blends and organic shapes. There are no elements that suggest contamination, decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque forms, or anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea. The composition is clean and visually appealing, with no clashing elements or chaotic textures that would be so overwhelmingly unpleasant as to border on disgust. The overall impression is one of artistic expression, not something offensive or repulsive."
washington-d-c-december-1964-10-i-1964.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting, composed of horizontal bands of warm, earthy colors—a vibrant orange atop a rich red, transitioning to a deep purplish-brown at the bottom—offers no visual cues or artistic elements that would evoke disgust. The color palette is harmonious and inviting, suggestive of natural phenomena like sunsets or layered landscapes, rather than anything sickly, decaying, or repulsive. There are no jarring contrasts, clashing hues, or unpleasant textures that might trigger a visceral negative reaction. Furthermore, the composition is simple, balanced, and serene, lacking any unsettling forms, chaotic arrangements, or disturbing imagery. The overall impression is one of visual tranquility and warmth, which stands in direct opposition to the sensations associated with disgust. Therefore, this artwork provides absolutely no stimulus for such an emotion."
white-roses-sing-and-sing-1976.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract painting presents no visual elements that evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork consists of an irregular tessellation of mostly white, broken shapes against a green background, with scattered small yellow shapes. There is no discernible subject matter that could be considered repulsive, offensive, unsanitary, or morally objectionable. The colors used—white, green, and yellow—are not inherently unpleasant or associated with decay, illness, or bodily fluids. While the shapes are fragmented and irregular, they do not coalesce into anything grotesque or unsettling. There is no depiction of gore, filth, pests, or anything that would typically trigger a sensation of revulsion. The overall impression is one of pattern, texture, and color composition, entirely devoid of characteristics that would elicit disgust."
white-fire-i-1954.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The artwork presents a clean, minimalist aesthetic dominated by soft, cool tones and simple linear forms. There are no elements within the composition that depict decay, bodily fluids, waste, contamination, or any other subject matter typically associated with physical repulsion. The colors—a pale, almost ethereal background, a muted beige, and a vibrant blue—are clean and non-threatening, lacking any jarring or unpalatable combinations. While the blue line exhibits a slightly textured or irregular edge, this is perceived as an artistic characteristic, perhaps indicating a painterly application or the material quality of the medium, rather than anything unsanitary or grotesque. The abstract nature of the piece also means there are no narrative or symbolic elements that could provoke moral or ethical revulsion. The overall impression is one of calm, simplicity, and visual order, which stands in direct opposition to feelings of disgust."
untitled-no-56-1996.jpg,colorField,7.5,"The painting presents a pattern of irregular green shapes on a white background, with a central disruption of yellow and black forms. Evaluating this work solely for the emotion of disgust, the visual elements offer very few direct triggers. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with contamination, decay, bodily fluids, poor hygiene, or things perceived as repulsive or harmful.

In this artwork:
1.  **Color Palette:** The dominant green, white, and the relatively bright yellow and solid black are not inherently colors that universally or even commonly evoke disgust. While yellow can sometimes be associated with bodily fluids (e.g., urine, bile), the specific hue here is more golden/mustard, and its abstract context does not strongly suggest such an interpretation. Similarly, black does not automatically convey decay or filth in this abstract arrangement.
2.  **Shapes and Forms:** The shapes are abstract and amorphous, resembling irregular blobs or stylized patches. They do not depict anything concretely identifiable as rotten food, waste, or grotesque organic matter. The central yellow and black forms are irregular ""splotches"" that disrupt the pattern, but their ambiguity prevents a direct association with something inherently disgusting. They are too abstract to be clearly perceived as a ""stain"" of a disgusting substance.
3.  **Texture and Medium:** The visible folds and somewhat crude application of paint suggest a raw, unrefined aesthetic. While this might be seen as ""messy"" or ""unpolished"" by some, it does not translate into a feeling of revulsion or uncleanness in the way true disgust manifests. It speaks more to the artistic process and material rather than depicting something literally disgusting.

There is no representation of gore, disease, waste, or anything putrid. The abstract nature of the painting allows for multiple interpretations, but none strongly lean towards a universally disgusting subject. A very minor degree of discomfort *might* arise from the perceived ""messiness"" or the ambiguous nature of the central splotches, which *could* be *very lightly* associated with an unintended spill or imperfection. However, this is a highly tenuous link and does not evoke a visceral reaction of disgust. Therefore, the score remains very low, reflecting the absence of specific visual triggers for this emotion."
yellow-abstract-1961.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an abstract work, this painting does not present any elements commonly associated with the emotion of disgust. There are no grotesque or repulsive figures, no scenes depicting decay, violence, or bodily functions. The colors used – a warm, earthy brown-orange, a creamy off-white, and a pale blue – are natural and calming, far from evoking sensations of illness, filth, or putrefaction. The forms are simple and organic, a large rounded shape with clean lines, which do not suggest anything unsettling or unhygienic. There is no visual information that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion or aversion. The painting is aesthetically clean and minimalist, offering no content that could be interpreted as offensive or repulsive. Therefore, based purely on the visual information provided, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent."
white-sun-box-1966.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting presents a stark, minimalist composition dominated by white space, a faint rectangular outline, and a bright yellow horizontal line. There is absolutely nothing in this image that would reasonably trigger an emotional response of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are repulsive, offensive, unclean, rotten, or morally objectionable. This artwork contains none of these elements. The colors are clean and simple, the lines are deliberate (even if hand-drawn and slightly imperfect, they do not convey sloppiness in a repulsive way), and the subject matter is abstract, devoid of any discernible objects or narratives that could be associated with contamination, decay, waste, or anything that would cause revulsion or nausea. The overall aesthetic is one of clarity and simplicity, rather than anything that would induce an averse reaction."
winter-1999.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this painting for the emotion of disgust, I find no discernible elements within the composition that would elicit such a response. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, disease, bodily effluvia, or things that are inherently repulsive to our senses due to their potential for harm or contamination.

This abstract piece features two clean, simple rectangular planes against a pristine white background. The left rectangle is a pale, luminous off-white, almost like frosted glass or a clean, unblemished surface. The right rectangle displays a muted, somewhat iridescent green-gold hue, reminiscent of certain minerals or a refined metallic finish. Both colors are relatively calm and sophisticated, lacking any vibrancy that might be associated with sickness or any muddiness that suggests decay or putrefaction. There are no organic forms, no disturbing textures, no chaotic lines, and no subject matter that could be interpreted as unhygienic, grotesque, or vile. The aesthetic is one of order, minimalism, and a study of color and light. The subtle variations in tone within each rectangle add depth without introducing any quality that could be construed as unpleasant or sickening. Therefore, based on the visual information provided, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent."
veiled-sail-1969.jpg,colorField,0.0,"As an art expert, I perceive this image as an abstract work utilizing fluid brushstrokes, vibrant colors, and splattering techniques to create a dynamic and decorative border around a central white space. The colors (reds, blues, yellows, oranges, and earthy tones) are bright and clear, not muddy, sickly, or indicative of decay or contamination. The forms, though organic and somewhat chaotic due to the splatters and fluid movement, are clearly artistic expressions of paint, not representations or evocations of anything putrid, unsanitary, grotesque, or otherwise offensive that would typically trigger the emotion of disgust. The ""messiness"" of the splatters is an intentional aesthetic choice, contributing to the energy of the piece rather than suggesting unhygienic conditions or decay. There is absolutely nothing within the visual elements of this artwork that remotely aligns with the triggers for disgust, such as foul odors, decay, bodily fluids, or anything perceived as intrinsically repulsive or a threat to health or purity. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent."
yellow-painting-14-1995.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The image presented is a pure, unadulterated field of vibrant yellow. Disgust is a primal emotion typically elicited by stimuli perceived as threatening to one's physical health (e.g., spoiled food, bodily waste, disease vectors) or moral well-being. This abstract, monochromatic composition lacks any visual cues that could trigger such a response. There are no depictions of decay, filth, organic matter, gore, or anything unhygienic or contaminated. The color itself, while bright, does not inherently carry connotations of revulsion or a threat to cleanliness. The surface appears uniform and clean, offering no disturbing textures or patterns. Consequently, there is absolutely nothing within this visual presentation that would elicit any level of disgust."
yellows-1969.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork is an abstract composition featuring large, flat fields of color. There is nothing inherently disgusting or repulsive in the subject matter, as it is non-representational. The colors used—a dark olive green, an orange-yellow, and a lighter yellow, with thin accents of red—are not typically associated with bodily fluids, decay, or anything that would trigger a visceral sensation of revulsion. The forms are simple geometric blocks, devoid of any disturbing or grotesque imagery. While some might perceive the slight variations in color application, such as subtle streaking or minuscule speckles within the green and yellow fields, as ""imperfect"" or ""grimy"" if viewed through a very critical lens focused on pristine surfaces, these are characteristic textures of printmaking or painting and do not evoke a strong feeling of disgust. The overall impression is one of clean lines and deliberate color blocking, which is aesthetically neutral or pleasing rather than offensive or stomach-churning. Therefore, the level of disgust evoked by this artwork is extremely low, virtually negligible."
zebra-1969.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This painting elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by something revolting, offensive, or visually unappealing in a visceral way, often associated with decay, filth, the grotesque, or subject matter that is inherently repugnant. This abstract work, composed of neat vertical stripes of various colors (greens, purples, yellows, pinks, blues, browns, and white), presents an orderly and systematic exploration of color and line. There is no discernible subject matter that could be deemed offensive, disturbing, or gross. The colors, while varied and sometimes creating optical effects due to their juxtaposition, are not muddy, sickly, or jarring in a way that would induce revulsion. The composition is clean, repetitive, and lacks any chaotic or grotesque elements. The overall impression is one of visual rhythm and chromatic interplay, which might be perceived as stimulating, calming, or even a bit monotonous by some, but never disgusting."
yellow-line-painting-1973.jpg,colorField,12.5,"The primary aesthetic of this abstract painting does not actively aim to evoke disgust; however, a subtle and highly subjective sensation of revulsion can arise for certain viewers due to specific visual characteristics. The elongated, irregular, and somewhat squiggly forms, rendered with a thick, textured, almost corporeal paint application, can, for some, trigger pareidolia, leading to an interpretation of these shapes as organic entities such as worms, larvae, or detached internal tissues. The varied coloration of these forms, including some pallid greens, purples, and light pinks, when combined with their somewhat lumpy and sinuous appearance, can inadvertently suggest biological matter that is not entirely healthy or appealing. Furthermore, their clustered arrangement against the vibrant, almost clinical yellow background, rather than appearing as natural growth, might enhance this subtle unsettling feeling by presenting them as an accumulation of unidentifiable, soft-bodied forms. While this is far from the painting's dominant emotional register, and many viewers would experience no disgust at all, the potential for this specific, unsettling association contributes to a very low, yet discernible, score on the disgust scale."
