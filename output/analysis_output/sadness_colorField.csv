318-61-1961.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting predominantly features a spectrum of warm, highly saturated colors, transitioning from bright yellow at the top to vibrant orange, and then to deep, rich red at the bottom. These hues (yellow, orange, red) are overwhelmingly associated with feelings of warmth, energy, passion, and vitality, rather than sorrow or melancholy. There is an absence of cool tones (blues, grays), desaturated colors, or dark, muted shades that are typically linked with sadness or a somber mood. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the piece provides no narrative or figurative elements that might depict loss, grief, or a state of emotional distress. The smooth, almost meditative gradient creates a sense of flow or intensity, but not one of despondency. While the deepest red at the bottom might convey a profound intensity, it reads more as powerful or grounding than mournful. The overall impression is one of vibrant energy and warmth, which stands in stark contrast to the experience of sadness, thus resulting in a very low score."
29-03-60-1960.jpg,colorField,12.5,"The overall impression of this abstract composition evokes a very minimal sense of sadness. The most significant contributor to this slight feeling is the large black rectangle on the upper right. Black is often associated with absence, void, or the unknown, which can, for some viewers, trigger a subtle feeling of emptiness or solemnity akin to a very mild form of melancholy. The deep maroon-red of the adjacent block on the left also carries a certain gravity or seriousness, which could be interpreted as solemn, but not overtly sad.

However, any potential for significant sadness is largely counteracted by several elements. The vibrant red block dominating the bottom half of the canvas is strong, warm, and grounded, conveying a sense of energy and stability rather than sorrow. Furthermore, the visible streaks and borders of bright yellow, green, and orange around the edges of the composition add flashes of vibrancy and light, preventing the piece from feeling overwhelmingly dark or somber. The painting's abstract nature, without any discernible figures or narrative elements, also means there are no direct visual cues that typically convey grief, loss, or emotional distress. Thus, while a fleeting sense of solemnity or void might be perceived due to the black and deep red tones, it is far from the dominant emotional response."
aberddeen-i-1970.jpg,colorField,12.5,"The painting evokes a very minimal sense of sadness, primarily due to its abstract nature and the specific color palette employed. The pastel shades of light blue and pink, set against a soft, light grey background, are inherently luminous and gentle, actively working against feelings of deep sorrow or despair. These colors tend to be associated with calm, tranquility, or even a lighthearted dreaminess rather than melancholy.

However, a very faint whisper of sadness might be perceived through the subtle visual suggestions of incompleteness and the gravity implied by the dripping paint. The fragmented nature of the lines, particularly where the ""frame"" appears broken or dissolves on the right side and bottom, could subtly allude to a sense of something not whole, a boundary that doesn't fully contain, or a quiet absence. The vertical drips, while aesthetically controlled, can metaphorically suggest a slow release, a gentle letting go, or a fading, which, in a highly abstract interpretation, might touch upon a very mild, non-overt sense of wistfulness or quiet longing, rather than profound grief. There is no overt narrative, dramatic tension, or use of typically somber elements that would elevate the feeling of sadness beyond this very slight, almost imperceptible undertone. The overall impression leans more towards serene contemplation or delicate structure than any significant emotional weight of sorrow."
867-97-vulcano-1997.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The visual elements of this painting offer very little to evoke a feeling of sadness. The dominant color is a vibrant, intense red, which is typically associated with energy, passion, urgency, or even anger, rather than sorrow or melancholy. Sadness is more commonly represented by cooler, muted tones like blues, greys, or desaturated colors, none of which are present here. The perfect circular shape lends a sense of completeness or focus, rather than fragmented or heavy emotions. While the lower portion features a darker, deeper red with a textured, somewhat jagged line, which could, in a very abstract and stretched interpretation, suggest a sense of disruption or struggle, the overall luminosity and boldness of the color palette prevent it from translating into genuine sadness. Instead, it reads more as a dramatic contrast or a dynamic natural formation, contributing to a feeling of intensity rather than sorrow. There are no figures, scenes, or compositional elements that directly convey loss, despair, or quiet contemplation often associated with sadness."
1952-a-1952.jpg,colorField,78.0,"The painting evokes a profound sense of sadness, primarily through its dominant color palette and visual texture. The overwhelming presence of deep, dark blues and blacks immediately sets a somber, melancholic, and introspective mood. These colors are intrinsically associated with night, emptiness, absence, and sorrow, creating a heavy, almost oppressive atmosphere that can feel emotionally weighty.

The visible vertical streaks and drips within the darker areas, particularly noticeable in the upper and lower sections, contribute significantly to this feeling. These marks can be interpreted as 'weeping' or 'tears' flowing down the canvas, suggesting a continuous, quiet sorrow or a sense of dissolution and decay. This adds a visceral quality to the sadness, as if the painting itself is expressing grief.

Furthermore, the narrow, bright yellow vertical strip on the far left, while a splash of color, paradoxically enhances the feeling of sadness. Its isolation and the overwhelming contrast with the vast, engulfing darkness of the blue/black field can symbolize a small, struggling sliver of hope or light being almost entirely consumed by despair or an immense void. This creates a sense of loneliness and highlights the sheer dominance of the darker emotions.

The subtle, faint red line running down the central blue vertical column, almost hidden, adds another layer of emotional depth. It can be perceived as a raw nerve, a wound, or a vulnerable aspect beneath the stoic blue, subtly amplifying the undertone of pain or vulnerability.

Overall, the painting doesn't depict overt scenes of sorrow, but through its abstract elements – the pervasive dark colors, the weeping textures, and the sense of a small light struggling against an immense darkness – it effectively creates a deep, contemplative, and pervasive feeling of melancholy and sadness. It's a quiet, profound sadness rather than an explosive display of grief."
after-the-cloud.jpg,colorField,30.0,"The painting evokes a subtle and quiet sense of sadness, rather than an overt or profound sorrow. The dominant cool color palette, particularly the pervasive shades of blue, inherently carries associations with introspection, quietude, and a degree of melancholy. The smooth, seamless gradient from lighter, ethereal blues at the top to deeper, more saturated blues at the bottom creates a visual descent, which can be interpreted as a metaphorical sinking or a feeling of gradual submersion into a more somber state. The overall muted tones and the absence of strong, vibrant contrasts contribute to a subdued and contemplative atmosphere, lending itself to a wistful or reflective mood rather than an energetic or joyful one. The delicate, thin horizontal line of muted orange, acting as a subtle horizon, can be seen as a fragile boundary or a fading warmth, evoking a sense of transient beauty or a quiet longing. While the piece also possesses qualities of peace and serenity, the softness, vastness, and the gentle progression into deeper blues subtly lean towards a reflective sadness, a quiet yearning or a tender sense of wistfulness that isn't overwhelming but gently present."
19-1963-1963.jpg,colorField,38.0,"The painting evokes a subtle, contemplative sadness rather than an overt expression of grief or despair. The central white vertical line, often referred to as a ""zip,"" acts as a stark divider, segmenting the expansive fields of color into two distinct entities. This separation can inherently suggest themes of division, isolation, or a profound rupture, which are common sources of sadness. The two areas of color, while similar, are not identical in hue—the left side leaning towards a lighter, somewhat softer pink-red, and the right a deeper, more intense shade. This subtle differentiation further emphasizes the idea of two distinct parts that exist separately, potentially hinting at a quiet ache of disconnect or an internal fragmentation.

Furthermore, the overall minimalism and monumentality of the composition can lead to an introspective experience"
1.jpg,colorField,78.5,"The painting profoundly evokes sadness through its deliberate use of color and composition, creating an atmosphere of deep melancholy. The dominant palette of rich, dark, and muted tones—a heavy reddish-brown at the top, a profound, almost electric blue in the middle, and a very dark, nearly black blue at the bottom—is intrinsically linked to somber, introspective, and sorrowful emotions. There is a complete absence of any bright, uplifting, or vibrant hues, immediately signaling a serious and weighty emotional landscape.

The large, stacked blocks of color contribute to a sense of solemnity and oppression. The upper reddish-brown block, particularly, carries a visual weight that feels imposing and heavy, akin to a burden or a pervasive gloom. The deep blue segment below it, while vibrant in its own right, resonates with the vastness and depth often associated with feelings of sorrow or longing, presenting a boundless emotional space that feels quiet yet intense. The darkest block at the bottom grounds the entire composition in an almost abyssal depth, reinforcing a sense of profound finality or an underlying void, which can be deeply unsettling and sad.

Furthermore, Rothko's characteristic soft, blurred edges between the color fields enhance the feeling of sadness. These indistinct transitions prevent any sharp breaks, suggesting a fluid, pervasive, and perhaps overwhelming sadness that seeps into and colors all aspects of the visual experience. This lack of clear definition can evoke a sense of things fading, dissolving, or being lost, contributing to a pervasive feeling of wistfulness or quiet despair rather than an acute, sudden grief. The overall stillness and gravity of the composition invite a deeply contemplative state, where the predominant emotional resonance is one of enduring, profound, and internalized sorrow."
alya-1964.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, featuring four identical abstract shapes in green with red and white centers on a plain white background, offers virtually no visual elements that would evoke a sense of sadness. The color palette—comprising a deep green, a vibrant red, and a stark white—is strong and contrasting, lacking the muted, desaturated, or cool tones (such as blues, grays, or purples) often associated with melancholy or sorrow. There are no dim or somber lighting conditions. The shapes themselves are stylized, symmetrical, and repeated, contributing to a sense of pattern and order rather than emotional distress or vulnerability. They do not represent human figures in states of grief, scenes of loss, or any narrative that would typically elicit feelings of sadness. The clean, untextured surface and the clear separation of the shapes against the white background further contribute to a sense of clarity and simplicity, rather than complexity or emotional turmoil. There is no implication of suffering, solitude, or any form of struggle. The overall impression is one of neutrality, design, or perhaps even a decorative quality, which are antithetical to the feeling of sadness."
alruccabah-1964.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The emotion of sadness is minimally present in this painting. While the central use of a deep blue color can sometimes be associated with melancholy or sadness in certain cultural contexts, in this particular composition, the blue appears vibrant and clear rather than somber or brooding. There are no narrative elements, figures, or discernible symbols that would typically convey a sense of loss, grief, or sorrow. The organic, undulating forms of the nested shapes contribute to a feeling of fluidity and calm rather than agitation or distress. The overall palette, including the warm earthy red and the natural green, creates a harmonious and balanced visual experience that leans more towards tranquility or contemplation than any form of profound sadness. The absence of heavy tones, sharp contrasts that might evoke distress, or any unsettling compositional choices further reduces any potential for a strong association with sadness. Any perception of sadness would likely be a very faint echo, primarily stemming from the abstract association of the color blue, and not a dominant emotional response evoked by the artwork as a whole."
amarillo-1971.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The visual elements within this artwork offer virtually no resonance with the emotion of sadness. The dominant and expansive presence of a very bright, almost luminous yellow immediately conveys feelings of energy, optimism, and cheerfulness, which are fundamentally antithetical to the somber, heavy, or melancholic sentiments typically associated with sadness. There is an absence of muted, dark, or cool color palettes that often evoke a sense of sorrow or despair. Furthermore, the composition is characterized by extremely clean, sharp, and precise geometric lines. This crispness and order tend to evoke a sense of clarity, design, or intellectual contemplation rather than emotional turmoil, loss, or gloom. The central diagonal void, while a division, is bright and sharp, not a deep, consuming, or shadowy emptiness that might suggest longing or absence. The minimalist nature of the piece provides no narrative elements, figures, or discernible objects that could carry a story of suffering, parting, or regret. Consequently, the artwork presents a visual language that is overwhelmingly devoid of the traditional markers and associative triggers for sadness, resulting in an exceptionally low score for this emotion."
apricot-ripple-1968.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting is composed entirely of vibrant and diverse vertical stripes, presenting a highly chromatic and orderly visual experience. The color palette includes a wide spectrum of hues, many of which are bright and highly saturated, such as vivid reds, yellows, and greens, alongside various shades of blue, pink, and earthy tones. These lively and varied colors inherently convey energy, dynamism, or a sense of visual interest rather than somberness or gloom. There is a complete absence of elements typically associated with sadness, such as muted, desaturated, or predominantly dark colors, or any chaotic, fragmented, or drooping forms that might suggest distress or melancholy. The strict verticality and repetitive nature of the stripes create a sense of rhythm and structure, which is neutral at best, but certainly not indicative of emotional heaviness or sorrow. Without any narrative, figurative content, or conventionally melancholic color schemes, the painting offers virtually no visual cues that would evoke an emotional response of sadness."
appleby-2011.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The artwork, comprising three vertical panels of light, textured paper, evokes an extremely low degree of sadness. The dominant off-white to light beige color palette is inherently neutral and lacks the somber, cool, or dark tones often associated with feelings of sadness or melancholy. There are no discernible figures, narratives, or symbolic elements within the composition that would typically convey loss, despair, isolation, or any form of emotional distress. The minimalist and abstract nature of the piece directs attention primarily to the material qualities of the paper itself—its texture, subtle variations, and deckled edges—rather than inviting a deep emotional engagement with specific human feelings. While the quietude and lack of vibrant activity in the image might, for some, evoke a very subtle sense of introspective calm that borders on a gentle wistfulness, it is far from an explicit expression of sadness. The overall impression is one of serene simplicity and natural authenticity, making any interpretation of sadness an extremely personal and tangential one, rather than a primary or intended emotional response."
all-night-1989.jpg,colorField,72.0,"The predominant element evoking sadness in this painting is the vast, deep expanse of dark blue that dominates the upper portion. This specific shade of blue (a rich, deep indigo or ultramarine) is frequently associated with profound melancholy, introspection, and solitude, conveying a sense of emotional weight and quiet sorrow. The sweeping, somewhat turbulent brushstrokes within this blue field contribute to a feeling of internal agitation or a heavy, brooding atmosphere, suggesting a stormy emotional state rather than tranquility. Below this heavy sky, the indistinct brownish horizon and the faint, vertical, almost skeletal forms (possibly desolate tree trunks) rising from the bright yellow base add to a sense of desolation, emptiness, or abandonment. These elements suggest a landscape stripped bare, which can subtly evoke feelings of loss or bleakness. The sharp, unyielding horizontal red band cutting across the lower third acts as a stark divider, perhaps symbolizing a harsh reality or an abrupt separation, further contributing to a sense of disquiet. While the yellow at the bottom is bright, its starkness against the dark blue and red does not uplift the mood but rather highlights the solemnity of the upper areas through jarring contrast, contributing to a feeling of fragmentation or an unresolved emotional tension. The cumulative effect of these visual choices creates an overriding atmosphere of deep-seated, contemplative sadness, a heavy and somber mood rather than one of joy or lightness."
attacca-1975.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements commonly associated with the emotion of sadness. The color palette is dominated by bright, vibrant hues such as fuchsia, various shades of green, vivid blue, strong red, sunny yellow, and warm orange. These colors are typically perceived as energetic, lively, and joyful, rather than somber or melancholic. There is an absence of deep, muted, or cool tones (like dark blues, grays, or heavy browns) that frequently evoke feelings of sorrow, introspection, or despair.

Furthermore, the brushstrokes are dynamic, bold, and sweeping, suggesting movement, spontaneity, and vitality. There is a sense of upward or diagonal trajectory in many of the strokes, which conveys energy and uplift rather than the drooping, heavy, or stagnant forms often linked to sadness or resignation. The composition lacks any visual weight or sense of collapse that might hint at grief or burden.

As an abstract piece, there is no discernible narrative or figurative subject matter that could convey a story of loss, longing, or despair. The overall impression is one of lightness, vibrancy, and playful expression. The neutral background serves to highlight the colorful strokes rather than creating a feeling of emptiness or desolation. Consequently, the visual language of the artwork strongly leans away from any evocation of sadness. The score is not an absolute zero only because art interpretation can be highly subjective, and a microscopic chance of an extremely idiosyncratic reading exists, but for the vast majority of viewers, sadness would not be an emotional response."
autumn-leaves-fluttering-in-the-breeze-1973.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The painting predominantly features a vibrant, almost fiery orange, combined with bright, energetic blues and splashes of lime green. These colors are inherently lively and stimulating, generally evoking feelings of warmth, energy, or excitement rather than somberness or melancholy. The fragmented, mosaic-like application of the paint creates a dynamic and active surface, contributing to a sense of visual movement and intensity rather than stillness or a weighty, subdued atmosphere often associated with sadness. There are no forms, figures, or narrative elements within the abstract composition that could directly suggest themes of loss, despair, or sorrow. The overall impression is one of vivacity and bold visual texture. Any minimal perception of sadness might arise only from a highly abstract interpretation of the fragmented shapes as a sense of 'brokenness' or disunity, but this is overwhelmingly counteracted by the energetic color palette and active composition, making any direct evocation of sadness extremely negligible."
ayin-1958.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The painting evokes a very low and subtle sense of sadness, more akin to a quiet melancholy or wistfulness rather than overt sorrow or grief. This sensation arises primarily from the muted and desaturated color palette, featuring soft blues, greens, browns, and faint yellows that lack vibrancy and contribute to a subdued atmosphere. The gentle, vertical streaks of color, reminiscent of a waterfall or downward flow, might subtly suggest a sense of letting go or a quiet descent, which can be interpreted as poignant. Furthermore, the soft, blurred edges where the colors bleed and dissolve into the white background create an ethereal quality, hinting at ephemerality or the fading away of something. This sense of transience can evoke a mild feeling of quiet loss or introspection. However, the overall impression is one of calm and serenity, preventing any deep or overwhelming sense of sadness. The abundance of white space around the central color form keeps the composition feeling light and airy, rather than heavy or oppressive. Therefore, the sadness present is extremely mild, an undertone of thoughtful pensiveness rather than a dominant emotional response."
beta-lambda-1961.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The overall impression of this painting does not strongly evoke sadness. The vibrant and diverse palette of colors, including bright reds, oranges, yellows, blues, and greens, tends to counteract any immediate feeling of melancholy. While the lines exhibit a distinct downward flow, reminiscent of drips or runs, this movement could metaphorically be interpreted as tears. However, the sheer variety and relative cheerfulness of the colors dilute this potential connection to sorrow. Instead of conveying a singular, profound grief, the multiple hues suggest a multifaceted or even playful fluidity rather than the somber weight often associated with sadness. The ample, bright, negative space also contributes to a sense of openness and lightness rather than confinement or desolation. There are no heavy, dark tones or despondent forms that typically signify deep sadness. Any feeling of sadness is therefore very subtle and relies heavily on a specific, non-dominant interpretation of the 'dripping' element, which is largely overshadowed by the visual energy of the colors."
archimandrite-1960.jpg,colorField,43.5,"The painting evokes a moderate sense of sadness primarily through its dominant cool color palette and the substantial, weighty forms. The pervasive deep blues, especially the darker shades on the left and far right, contribute significantly to a somber and melancholic atmosphere, as blue is commonly associated with feelings of ""the blues"" or sorrow. These large blue fields create a sense of vastness and depth that can be interpreted as contemplative or heavy. Similarly, the deep, earthy green shape, while also cool, adds to the painting's overall gravitas, suggesting a grounded, perhaps burdened, emotional state rather than one of lightness or cheer. The composition, with its large, block-like divisions, lends a sense of unyielding permanence or stillness, which can be perceived as solemn. While the central"
banjo-1981.jpg,colorField,25.0,"The painting evokes a subtle and quiet sense of sadness rather than an overwhelming or despairing one. This is primarily influenced by the prominent use of deep indigo and muted purplish-blue tones, colors often associated with introspection, melancholy, and a somber mood. The overall color palette is subdued and lacks vibrant, energetic hues, contributing to a more pensive and less uplifting atmosphere. The subtle variations and slight blurring within the vertical stripes can also lend a feeling of wistfulness or a gentle, fading quality, akin to a quiet sigh.

However, the potential for strong sadness is significantly mitigated by several factors. The presence of warm yellow and reddish-brown stripes introduces elements of light, warmth, and earthiness, preventing the composition from feeling cold, bleak, or devoid of hope. These contrasting colors balance the somber blues, creating a more complex emotional landscape that leans towards quiet contemplation rather than deep sorrow. The rhythmic, repetitive nature of the vertical lines, while potentially meditative, does not inherently convey distress or unhappiness. There are no explicit narrative elements or recognizable forms that would typically trigger a direct and profound feeling of grief or sorrow. Therefore, any sense of sadness remains abstract, subdued, and gently melancholic, rather than intense or sorrowful."
beth-zayin-1959.jpg,colorField,82.0,"The painting evokes a strong sense of sadness primarily through its dominant dark and murky central mass, which is created by numerous overlapping vertical strokes of subdued colors. This visual density creates a heavy, almost oppressive feeling, akin to a burden or a profound internal weight that often accompanies sorrow. The most striking element contributing to sadness is the presence of distinct dark drips and streaks, particularly noticeable towards the bottom-left and center, which serve as a powerful visual metaphor for tears, evoking a sense of weeping or profound grief. The way the colors at the edges of this dark mass appear to bleed and dissipate into the lighter background suggests a dissolution or fading, resonating with feelings of loss or the quiet ebbing of joy. The overall somber and muted palette within the dark central area further enhances this melancholic atmosphere, creating a sense of introspection and quiet despair. The absence of clear, vibrant forms or discernible figures within this darkness leaves an impression of obscurity and a deep, internalized emotional state consistent with profound sadness."
blue-and-yellow-and-red-orange-1965.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This artwork evokes virtually no sense of sadness. The primary colors – a vibrant blue, a cheerful yellow, and an energetic red – are bold and pure, inherently lacking the somberness or muted tones often associated with sorrow. These hues, especially yellow and red, typically convey vibrancy, warmth, and vitality rather than melancholy. The shapes are simple, smooth ovals, which are organic and harmonious, devoid of any angularity or distortion that might suggest unease or distress. Furthermore, their stable, stacked arrangement conveys balance and order, rather than instability, collapse, or isolation, which could potentially trigger feelings of sadness. There are no narrative elements, figures, or expressions to interpret as sorrowful. The overall minimalist composition is clean, direct, and focuses on the pure interplay of color and form, contributing to a feeling of clarity and aesthetic simplicity that is far removed from any emotional resonance of sadness. The light background further reinforces this sense of openness and absence of gloom."
black-on-maroon-4.jpg,colorField,85.0,"The painting evokes a profound and pervasive sense of sadness through its dominant use of deep, rich, and dark colors, primarily somber browns and muted, heavy reds. These hues intrinsically carry associations with solemnity, introspection, and melancholy, creating an immediate atmospheric impression of gravitas and sorrow. The large, imposing, and vertically oriented color fields contribute to a feeling of weight and solemnity, almost as if bearing a heavy emotional burden. Their indistinct edges and soft transitions prevent any sense of dynamism or lightness, instead fostering a contemplative and deeply internal mood that aligns with quiet grief or profound wistfulness. There is no vibrancy, joy, or narrative element to distract from this somber emotional core; instead, the abstract forms and limited palette allow the raw emotional impact of the colors to wash over the viewer, leaving an undeniable impression of deep, unadorned sadness."
black-on-maroon-1.jpg,colorField,78.0,"The painting evokes a profound sense of sadness, bordering on deep melancholy, primarily through its dominant color palette and static composition. The overwhelming presence of extremely dark, muted tones—deep blues or blacks combined with a rich, desaturated reddish-brown—immediately establishes a somber and weighty atmosphere. These colors are inherently associated with solemnity, introspection, and sorrow, completely devoid of any vibrancy, warmth, or light that might suggest joy or hope. The forms themselves, two indistinct, vertical rectangles, appear almost as silent, imposing presences or dark voids within the dense, dark background. Their soft, blurred edges prevent them from feeling harsh or aggressive, instead lending them a quality of quiet resignation or absorption. There is no visual dynamism or movement, reinforcing a sense of stillness, contemplation, and perhaps a heavy, unmoving burden. The lack of specific narrative or recognizable figures allows the viewer's emotional response to be driven purely by the abstract elements, and in this case, the pervasive darkness and subdued tones strongly guide that response towards a feeling of profound, quiet sorrow or a deeply melancholic state. The overall impression is one of grave solemnity, a hushed sadness that pervades the entire visual space."
blue-painting-2002.jpg,colorField,10.0,"The emotion of sadness is minimally evoked by this painting. While the color blue is widely associated with feelings of melancholy or sorrow, the specific shade presented here, a highly saturated, vibrant, and pure ultramarine, largely counteracts typical sad connotations. This intense blue feels more expansive, luminous, and even transcendent than it does somber or mournful. It lacks the muted tones, darkness, or desaturation often linked with profound sadness or depression. Furthermore, the monochrome nature of the artwork offers no narrative elements, figures, or discernible compositional structures that might typically convey a sense of grief, loss, or despair. The uniform field of color, while potentially inviting introspection, does not present any visual cues for struggle, loneliness, or emotional burden. The slight texture visible on the surface also does not contribute to a feeling of sadness. Therefore, despite the inherent association of the color blue with sadness, the particular qualities of this artwork – its intense saturation, purity, and lack of narrative – effectively mitigate any strong emotional resonance of sorrow, resulting in a very low score."
canto-xi-1964.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork, characterized by its stark simplicity and bold color blocks (a vibrant yellow and a deep forest green), offers no visual cues that would evoke sadness. The colors themselves are strong and saturated; yellow is typically associated with cheerfulness and energy, while green often signifies nature, growth, or harmony. There is no desaturation, muddiness, or somberness in the palette that might suggest a melancholic mood. The composition is entirely abstract, consisting of two geometric rectangles. There are no figures, narratives, or representational elements that could convey loss, grief, or despair. The clean lines and stable forms do not express turmoil or fragility. Even the textured quality of the green block, while adding visual interest, does not translate into an emotional state of sadness. The overall impression is one of balance, directness, and visual clarity, entirely devoid of any resonance with feelings of sorrow or melancholy."
blues-reds-1969.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The emotion of sadness is almost entirely absent in this artwork. While blue is a color sometimes associated with melancholy or ""the blues,"" the shades of blue used here – a vibrant royal blue and a deep, rich navy – are strong, stable, and clear, rather than muted, somber, or desaturated tones that might more readily evoke feelings of sorrow or despair. Furthermore, the bold, geometric forms and the stark division of space convey a sense of order and assertiveness rather than emotional vulnerability or grief. The prominent, energetic red color on the right side of the composition actively works against any potential subdued feelings that the blues might otherwise introduce, injecting vibrancy and intensity. There are no narrative elements, figures, or expressive brushstrokes that suggest suffering, loss, or any form of emotional distress. The overall impression is one of formal balance and a direct exploration of color and shape, devoid of any discernible emotional weight related to sadness. Any fleeting perception of sadness would be extremely minimal and likely stems from a very generalized, weak association with the color blue, which is strongly overridden by the overall dynamic and composed nature of the piece."
backbone-1979.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, dominated by an intense field of red with visible fine horizontal lines, offers very little to evoke a feeling of sadness. Red is typically associated with strong emotions such as passion, anger, or love, rather than sorrow or melancholy, which are more commonly linked to cooler tones like blues or grays. The vibrant and encompassing nature of the red field gives the piece an energetic or assertive quality, not one of somberness or despair. There are no narrative elements, figures, or symbolic representations that might suggest loss, grief, or introspection. The subtle white or very light area at the bottom, formed by a gentle curve, introduces a compositional break but does not carry any discernible sad connotations; it merely provides contrast to the dominant red. The texture, created by the etched or printed lines, provides a visual interest but does not translate into a heavy or mournful sensation. Overall, the piece conveys a powerful statement of color and form, devoid of the visual cues typically associated with sadness, such as drooping forms, muted palettes, or depressive themes. Therefore, the presence of sadness is extremely negligible, almost non-existent."
broad-turning-1958.jpg,colorField,60.0,"The painting strongly evokes a sense of sadness primarily through its dominant color palette and the visual characteristics of its forms. The canvas is largely consumed by deep, muted, and earthy tones – various shades of dark brown, somber olive greens, and subtle hints of muted reddish-brown. These colors inherently carry associations with gravity, introspection, and melancholy, contributing to a somber and weighty atmosphere rather than one of vibrancy or joy.

The large, heavy, and somewhat amorphous shapes, reminiscent of draped fabric or natural rock formations, convey a sense of gravitas and immobility. They appear to sag or hang heavily, which can be interpreted as a visual metaphor for emotional weight or despondency. The absence of sharp, energetic lines or bright, uplifting colors further reinforces this feeling of solemn quietude.

Furthermore, the visible vertical streaks and drips of paint throughout the composition suggest a downward flow, which can powerfully symbolize tears, rain, or the slow, inevitable descent of spirits. This visual ""weeping"" effect adds a profound layer of sorrow, implying a quiet dissolution or a lingering mournfulness. The overall impression is one of a pervasive, atmospheric melancholy, a quiet sadness that permeates the space rather than an acute, dramatic burst of grief. It invites a contemplative, somewhat mournful introspection, much like a deep sigh or a heavy silence."
canto-iii-1963.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The dominant and expansive black field in the artwork immediately evokes a profound sense of darkness, void, and absence, which are often associated with sadness and melancholy. This overwhelming presence of black can feel weighty and oppressive, contributing to a somber mood. The single, stark white vertical line, known as a ""zip,"" stands in striking isolation against this vast dark backdrop. This visual representation of solitude can resonate with feelings of loneliness or being a singular entity against an immense, perhaps indifferent, expanse, thereby triggering a quiet, existential sadness. Furthermore, the raw and somewhat irregular edges of both the black shape and the white line lend a rugged, unrefined quality, which can suggest a lack of comfort or a rawness that aligns with deeper, unvarnished emotional states like profound sorrow rather than serenity or joy. The minimalist nature of the composition, devoid of anecdotal details, forces a direct confrontation with these fundamental elements, amplifying the potential for a deep, contemplative sense of melancholy or even grief over a perceived void or isolation."
burnt-umber-ultra-marine-l-1981.jpg,colorField,35.5,"The painting evokes a subtle and introspective sense of sadness, rather than an intense or overt sorrow. This is primarily conveyed through its muted and somber color palette, dominated by deep, earthy tones of dark brown/black against a stark, off-white background. This lack of vibrant or uplifting colors contributes to a melancholic atmosphere. The heavy, block-like forms of the dark masses possess a visual weight that can be interpreted as burdensome or oppressive, suggesting a feeling of being weighed down. Furthermore, the soft, slightly blurred edges of these shapes, especially where they meet the lighter background, create an impression of gentle diffusion or subtle erosion. This can subtly evoke feelings of transience, fading, or quiet dissolution, lending a melancholic beauty to the composition. The large expanse of relatively empty, lighter space above the grounded, dark forms might also be perceived as vast or isolating, contributing to a sense of quiet solitude or emptiness. The overall abstract and quiet nature of the painting encourages contemplation, and within this contemplative space, a feeling of gentle somberness or reflective melancholy can arise. It’s not a sadness of despair, but rather a subdued, almost meditative sorrow that whispers rather than shouts."
canto-xiv-1964.jpg,colorField,5.2,"The painting, ""Canto XIII"" by Barnett Newman, is an abstract work dominated by deep, rich hues of red. The composition features a central, wider band of a darker, more maroon-like red flanked by two narrower vertical bands of a brighter, yet still deep, red. While red can be associated with a wide range of intense emotions, including passion, anger, or even danger, it does not inherently or strongly evoke sadness in this context.

The specific shades of red chosen here are rich and profound rather than mournful or desaturated, which would typically be associated with sorrow. The abstract nature of the piece, with its simple, geometric vertical ""zips,"" tends to move beyond specific narrative emotions, aiming instead for a sublime or contemplative experience. There are no figures, narratives, or environmental elements that suggest loss, despair, or melancholy. The strong, vertical forms create a sense of presence and stability, rather than fragility or vulnerability. While the deep tones might lend a certain solemnity or gravitas to the artwork, this solemnity is more akin to a profound, meditative state than an experience of grief or unhappiness. The intensity of the color fields could be seen as powerful or arresting, but not sorrowful. Therefore, any sense of sadness derived from this painting would be highly subjective and minimal, likely stemming from a very subtle interpretation of the deep, non-vibrant red as somber rather than passionate or forceful."
canto-xii-1964.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork evokes an extremely low degree of sadness. The primary reason for this low rating is the complete absence of visual cues traditionally associated with sorrow or melancholy. The color palette, composed of a vibrant, energetic yellow and a deep, earthy green, does not contain any shades commonly linked with sadness (such as muted blues, somber greys, or dark, oppressive blacks). Furthermore, the composition is a minimalist abstraction, devoid of any narrative elements, human figures, or desolate landscapes that might inspire a feeling of sadness. The stark, vertical division between the two color fields is more indicative of formal tension or balance rather than emotional distress. While abstract art can sometimes evoke profound emotions through color and form, the particular combination here leans towards contemplation, energy, or perhaps a meditative quality, rather than any sense of sorrow or lament. The slight textural variation in the green does not convey despair, but rather the characteristic quality of the print medium. Overall, there are no discernible elements within the piece that would prompt a feeling of sadness."
canto-iv-1963.jpg,colorField,88.5,"The visual elements of Barnett Newman's ""Cantos III"" powerfully evoke a profound and contemplative sadness, bordering on existential melancholy. The dominant feature is the vast, immersive black rectangle, which consumes almost the entire canvas space. Black is universally associated with darkness, void, absence, and mourning, immediately establishing a somber and heavy emotional tone. This immense field of blackness can feel overwhelming and oppressive, creating a sense of being enveloped by a deep sorrow or an unending emptiness. The subtle, slightly textured quality of the black pigment adds to its tactile presence, making the darkness feel dense, weighty, and almost tangible, akin to the physical burden of grief.

Cutting through this formidable black expanse is Newman's signature ""zip""—a slender, vertical stripe of an even darker black. This subtle differentiation within the blackness does not offer relief; instead, it intensifies the feeling of profound sorrow. The zip can be interpreted as:
1.  **A piercing element:** Like a silent, unwavering wound or incision within the vastness, symbolizing a deep-seated pain or internal suffering that is not loud or dramatic, but deeply felt and persistent.
2.  **A subtle division:** It subtly splits the unified field of darkness, perhaps representing an internal schism, isolation, or the way sadness can create a sense of separation even within oneself or from the external world.
3.  **A focal point of inescapable truth:** Its unwavering verticality suggests an unyielding reality or a persistent state of being, much like a pervasive sadness that feels impossible to escape. It draws the eye into the depths of the black, fostering introspection rather than distraction.

The minimalist and abstract nature of the work, devoid of any specific narrative or figural representation, allows the"
cercles-de-nuit-1992.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this abstract artwork that evokes or suggests sadness. The painting features vibrant and bright colors—red, green, yellow, and white—forming dynamic spirals against a deep, stable blue background. These colors are typically associated with energy, vitality, and even joy, rather than sorrow. The forms themselves, being spirals, convey a sense of continuous motion, rhythm, and perhaps growth or playfulness, none of which align with feelings of sadness. There are no somber tones, drooping lines, melancholic subjects, or any visual cues that would lead an observer to feel or interpret sadness. The overall impression is one of brightness, movement, and an almost cheerful energy, making any connection to sadness entirely absent."
carthage-1962.jpg,colorField,5.7,"The emotion of sadness is minimally evoked by this painting. The dominant colors are a vibrant, almost aggressive red and a deep, stark black. While black can sometimes be associated with concepts like void, emptiness, or solemnity, which might touch upon sadness, its presentation here is very graphic and contained. The black shape, while central and expansive, feels more like a strong, defined form rather than an amorphous representation of despair or a consuming void. It lacks the soft edges, muted tones, or evocative textures that might suggest a sense of melancholy or a heavy heart. The bright red background is inherently energetic and assertive, actively counteracting any potential somberness that the black might otherwise convey. There are no elements within the abstract shapes that suggest drooping forms, isolation, loss, or any traditional visual cues for sorrow. The overall impression is one of stark contrast and bold design, more aligned with a strong visual statement or an exploration of form rather than an emotional narrative of sadness. The shapes are somewhat organic and flowing, but they don't evoke a sense of vulnerability, longing, or internal suffering. Therefore, any feeling of sadness is extremely faint and indirect, primarily residing in the abstract potential of the color black to represent a void, but heavily diluted by the painting's powerful, graphic presence."
canto-xiii-1964.jpg,colorField,12.0,"The emotion of sadness is only very subtly evoked in this artwork, warranting a low score. The primary reason for this minimal evocation stems from the choice and juxtaposition of colors. While the vibrant, luminous yellow on the left side exudes warmth, energy, and a sense of uplift, strongly counteracting any potential for sorrow, the dark, muted olive-green/brown color on the right introduces a subtle element of solemnity or weight. This darker hue, often associated with earthiness, drabness, or a sense of gravity, carries a certain somberness. Furthermore, the texture within this dark field, appearing somewhat coarse and distressed, could be interpreted as conveying a slight sense of imperfection, age, or a less-than-smooth reality, which can contribute to a very mild, contemplative melancholy rather than an acute emotional sadness. The stark, abstract nature of the composition, devoid of narrative or comforting forms, might also lead some viewers to a feeling of austerity or detachment, which could be distantly related to a subdued, intellectual sadness. However, it's crucial to note that the overall impression is far from mournful or distressing. The strong presence of yellow significantly mitigates any deeper sense of sorrow, making any perceived sadness extremely faint and secondary to feelings of tension, balance, or contemplation."
cathedral-11-1968.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting predominantly features a vibrant and highly saturated color palette, including bright yellows, oranges, reds, and teal/turquoise. These colors, especially in their intense and luminous presentation, are generally associated with warmth, energy, joy, or optical engagement, rather than melancholic or somber emotions. The vertical stripes are upright and appear to glow due to the gradient effect, lacking any drooping lines or heavy forms that might convey a sense of weight or sorrow. There is no discernible subject matter, figures, or narrative elements that could evoke a feeling of sadness. The overall impression is one of optical vibrancy and dynamic color interaction, which stands in stark contrast to the visual cues typically associated with sadness, such as dark or muted tones, a sense of desolation, or a weighty atmosphere. Therefore, the visual elements of this painting offer virtually no contribution to an experience of sadness."
castle-banner-5-2004.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork does not evoke any discernible sense of sadness. The composition features a bold and vibrant color palette of bright red and a light, almost turquoise blue, which are generally associated with energy, calmness, or visual interest rather than melancholy or sorrow. The precise, geometric forms – a large grey rectangle and a light blue/turquoise triangle – contribute to a feeling of order and abstraction, devoid of any narrative or symbolic elements that typically convey grief, loss, or unhappiness. The dynamic yet contained interaction between the shapes, such as the triangular element appearing to fold or extend from the rectangle, is more suggestive of visual playfulness, movement, or formal exploration rather than distress or emotional weight. There are no muted tones, somber shading, downward lines, or distorted forms that might subtly hint at sadness in an abstract context. The overall impression is one of clean lines, balanced composition, and a focus on color and form, offering no visual cues or emotional resonance that would lead to a feeling of sadness."
citadel-1962.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, composed of vertical stripes of various colors, evokes an extremely minimal sense of sadness, bordering on none. While blue is a dominant color, which can sometimes be associated with melancholy, the specific shades used here are generally vibrant and deep (royal blue, sky blue), rather than desaturated or dull hues often linked to sorrow. Furthermore, the inclusion of bright, warm colors like red and orange in a prominent central position actively counteracts any potential somberness. These warm tones introduce energy and vibrancy that are antithetical to feelings of sadness. The overall composition is abstract and geometric, lacking any narrative or figurative elements that might typically convey a sense of despair or loss. The orderly arrangement of the stripes creates a sense of rhythm and calm, rather than emotional turmoil or unhappiness. The visual experience is primarily one of optical interaction and color harmony, not one that is designed to elicit or dwell on feelings of sadness."
coloured-wall-2003.jpg,colorField,0.0,"There are no discernible visual elements within this artwork that evoke a sense of sadness. The color palette, composed of earthy browns, warm oranges, bright yellows, and muted teals, does not align with colors typically associated with sorrow or melancholy (such as cold blues, dark greys, or highly desaturated tones). The abstract subject matter, a pattern of rectangular blocks, offers no narrative or figurative elements that could convey loss, despair, or grief. The composition is balanced and somewhat rhythmic, lacking any dramatic tension, oppressive darkness, or downward-sloping lines that might contribute to a feeling of sadness. The overall impression is one of gentle color interaction and abstract contemplation, devoid of any emotional weight that would suggest sorrow."
disneyesque-1971.jpg,colorField,5.0,"This abstract sculpture evokes very little, if any, sense of sadness. The dominant colors include a neutral light grey/blue for the large cubic base, and a darker grey, vibrant red, and energetic orange for the undulating form on top. Red and orange are typically associated with warmth, energy, and dynamism, directly contrasting with emotions of sorrow or melancholy. While the dark grey could lend a serious or slightly somber tone in isolation, its pairing with such bright, assertive colors, and its fluid, almost unfurling shape, prevents it from inducing sadness. The clean lines, precise construction, and bold visual statement inherent in this type of abstract, minimalist sculpture tend to focus on form, color, and spatial relationships rather than narrative or emotional states like grief or despair. There are no drooping forms, muted palettes, or symbolic elements typically linked to sadness. Any feeling of sadness derived from viewing this piece would likely be highly subjective and not intentionally embedded in the artwork's design or aesthetic."
concerto-1975.jpg,colorField,8.5,"The painting evokes a very low degree of sadness, bordering on negligible. The primary reason for any subtle hint of this emotion stems from the background, which is rendered in a desaturated, cool blue-grey hue. This color palette inherently lacks warmth and vibrancy, often associated with a subdued, introspective, or even melancholic mood. Furthermore, the visible, swirling brushstrokes in the background could be interpreted as a turbulent or restless mental state, which might, in some very abstract sense, carry a whisper of unease or sorrow, as if hinting at underlying emotional currents that are not entirely serene.

However, any potential for sadness is overwhelmingly counteracted by the prominent, vibrant, and highly saturated diagonal strokes in the foreground. These bursts of orange, red, white, blue, green, pink, yellow, purple, and gold are dynamic, energetic, and assertive, injecting a strong sense of vitality and movement into the composition. Their presence strongly overshadows the subtle, muted quality of the background, preventing any feeling of despondency or gloom from taking hold. There is no specific imagery traditionally associated with sadness, such as downtrodden figures, desolate landscapes, or overt symbols of loss or grief. The overall impression leans more towards an abstract expression of energy and color, with only the barest, most abstract undercurrent of a cool, possibly reflective, and therefore minimally sad, atmosphere provided by the backdrop."
dalet-tet-1959.jpg,colorField,82.5,"The dominant visual characteristic of this painting is the vast, consuming field of deep, almost impenetrable darkness that occupies the majority of the canvas. This profound blackness immediately evokes a powerful sense of solemnity, gravity, and the void, which are deeply resonant with feelings of sadness, loss, and mourning. The very absence of light and vibrant color within this central mass contributes significantly to a melancholic and heavy atmosphere.

Beneath the surface of this oppressive darkness, one can discern subtle, vertical streaks and muted tones—hints of deep reds, greens, and other colors that appear to be bleeding or submerged within the dominant dark pigment. These underlying hues do not offer a sense of vibrancy or uplift; instead, they seem to be absorbed or overwhelmed by the black, suggesting a fading of life, joy, or vibrancy, which further intensifies the feeling of sorrow. They can be interpreted as traces of past emotions or experiences that have been covered over by a pervasive sadness. The textural quality, particularly the visible, somber brushstrokes or marks, adds a sense of raw, unrefined emotion, akin to the rawness of grief.

Furthermore, the overall abstract nature of the piece, devoid of specific figures or narratives, allows the viewer to project universal feelings of despondency and profound introspection onto it. The subtle bleed of muted colors at the edges of the dark mass, rather than providing relief, emphasizes the encroaching weight of the central darkness, as if colors themselves are receding into a state of melancholy. The sheer visual weight and the somber quietude of the composition create an inescapable feeling of deep, introspective sadness, a quiet and enduring sorrow that settles heavily on the viewer."
corot-s-mark-1987.jpg,colorField,72.0,"The emotion of sadness is strongly evoked in this painting primarily through its dominant and pervasive use of a deep, rich blue hue. Blue is universally associated with feelings of melancholy, introspection, and quiet sorrow, and this specific shade, which leans towards a somber, almost indigo or Prussian blue, carries significant emotional weight. The sheer expanse of this color creates an immersive atmosphere that feels contemplative and subdued, contributing to a sense of profound quietude often linked with sadness.

The abstract nature of the composition further allows the viewer to project these feelings onto the canvas without the distraction of a specific narrative or figure that might dictate a different emotion. The subtle shifts in tone within the blue field, from lighter, almost hazy areas to deeper, more saturated zones, can be interpreted as variations of emotional states, perhaps moments of fading hope or a lingering sense of loss. The slightly diffused or ""washed"" appearance in certain areas might evoke the blurred vision associated with tears or a general feeling of indistinctness and melancholic reverie.

The faint, delicate lines and amorphous shapes, lacking clear definition or purpose, contribute to a sense of quiet yearning or a search for something lost, reinforcing a feeling of pensive sadness. The relatively straight horizontal line near the bottom could symbolize a horizon, a boundary, or even a sense of being grounded by a heavy emotion. The absence of any bright, warm, or energetic colors further ensures that the emotional register remains within the realm of the serious and contemplative, leaning heavily towards a pervasive sense of quiet sadness rather than vibrancy or joy. It's a sadness that feels internalized, a quiet melancholy rather than overt despair."
delta-lambda-1961.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting predominantly features a clean, expansive white background, which typically conveys a sense of openness, lightness, or neutrality, rather than the weight or solemnity often associated with sadness. The vibrant and diverse palette of colors used in the dripping lines, ranging from bright yellows and oranges to deep greens, purples, and browns, introduces a dynamic and energetic quality that generally counteracts feelings of melancholy or sorrow. While the downward dripping motion of the paint could, in some abstract interpretations, be loosely associated with tears or a sense of falling, the overall effect is more akin to fluid movement, natural flow, or spontaneous expression rather than despair or grief. There is no somber narrative, muted color scheme, or heavy compositional elements that would strongly evoke sadness. Any perceived sadness is minimal and likely derived from a very abstract and tenuous personal association with the 'dripping' motif, rather than a clear visual cue inherent in the artwork's core aesthetic. The painting's overall impression leans towards vitality and abstract expression, making it largely devoid of a strong emotional pull towards sadness."
double-gray-scramble-1973.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The artwork, a diptych composed of concentric squares by Frank Stella, evokes virtually no sense of sadness. Its nature is entirely abstract and geometric, focusing on formal elements such as line, shape, and color relationships rather than narrative or emotional content. The precision of the lines and the methodical arrangement of the squares create a sense of order and structure, which typically does not align with feelings of sorrow or despair. The color palette, while varied, includes numerous bright and warm hues (yellows, oranges, reds) alongside cooler tones and neutrals. There is no dominant use of colors traditionally associated with sadness (e.g., deep, muted blues or heavy greys), nor are the colors applied in a way that suggests melancholy or heaviness. The visual effect is one of optical illusion and spatial depth, inviting intellectual engagement or a meditative focus on pattern and color shifts, rather than an emotional response rooted in sorrow. There are no figures, expressions, landscapes, or objects that could convey loss, grief, or any other cause for sadness. Therefore, any feeling of sadness derived from this piece would be highly individual and tangential, rather than an inherent or intended emotional evocation of the artwork itself."
dawn-stroke-1977.jpg,colorField,72.5,"The painting evokes a discernible sense of sadness, primarily through its subdued color palette and evocative forms. The dominant muted tones of peach, beige, and faded brown create an atmosphere that feels quiet, almost wistful, devoid of vibrant energy. This desaturated quality contributes to a feeling of quiet melancholy rather than overt despair.

The most striking element contributing to sadness is the prominent vertical white streak on the right side of the canvas. This streak strongly resembles a tear flowing downwards, a universally recognized symbol of sorrow and weeping. The subtle reddish hue near its origin further enhances this interpretation, suggesting a raw or irritated source, akin to eyes swollen from crying. This visual metaphor directly taps into an emotional response linked to sadness.

Furthermore, the overall fluid and washed appearance of the paint, with its soft blending and drips, can suggest a sense of things dissolving, fading, or slipping away, aligning with themes of loss or transience that often accompany sadness. The small, isolated patch of green in the lower-middle, contrasting with the muted background, might be interpreted as something vulnerable, fragile, or perhaps even a memory, further contributing to a sense of quiet lament. The abstract nature of the work prevents a specific narrative of suffering, but it allows for an open interpretation of a deep, pervasive, yet perhaps resigned, sadness. It is a contemplative sadness, not loud or dramatic, but rather a profound, internal experience."
earth-sermon-beauty-love-and-peace-1971.jpg,colorField,1.0,"This painting evokes virtually no sadness. The vibrant, diverse, and luminous color palette, featuring a spectrum of bright reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, pinks, and purples, is inherently cheerful and energetic. There are no dark, muted, or somber tones typically associated with feelings of melancholy or sorrow. The composition of vertical stripes, made up of countless small, distinct brushstrokes (reminiscent of mosaic tiles or pointillist dots), creates a dynamic and textured surface that feels lively and optimistic rather than heavy or dispiriting. The overall effect is one of brightness, rhythm, and visual stimulation, all of which are antithetical to the emotion of sadness. There is no narrative, subject matter, or formal element within the artwork that suggests loss, despair, or any form of emotional distress. The painting's character is overwhelmingly positive and visually engaging, leaving no room for a sense of sadness."
e-226-1955.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of sadness. Its dominant color palette of vibrant orange, warm reds, and bright yellow, along with a small, contrasting blue line, are typically associated with warmth, energy, passion, and optimism, rather than melancholy or sorrow. The large, abstract, somewhat organic red shape, while having darker tones at the top, transitions smoothly into a more luminous red, and is set against an equally vibrant orange background. There are no visual cues such as muted or cold colors (beyond a tiny, bright blue accent), drooping forms, desolate landscapes, or figures expressing grief that would typically convey sadness. The overall impression is one of bold abstraction and a dynamic interplay of warm hues, entirely devoid of any somber or depressive qualities."
exposition-sam-francis-19-mars-5-mai-1983-poster.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The painting, an abstract work characterized by a vibrant and diverse palette of splattered colors, evokes little to no sense of sadness. The dominant hues – bright oranges, yellows, lively blues, verdant greens, and rich purples and reds – are typically associated with energy, dynamism, and vivacity, rather than somberness or melancholy. There is a complete absence of the muted, cool, or dark tones (such as grays, deep blues, or blacks) often employed to convey sorrow or introspection.

Furthermore, the technique of paint splattering and dripping creates an impression of spontaneous action and chaotic energy. This active and unconstrained application of paint contributes to an overall feeling of exhilaration or expression, which stands in stark contrast to the stillness, heaviness, or quiet despair often linked with sadness. There are no discernible figures, forms, or narrative elements that could suggest a story of loss, grief, or wistfulness. The composition's sheer vibrancy and the vigorous nature of its execution overwhelmingly communicate an energetic and lively mood, making it extremely difficult to perceive any inherent sadness within the artwork itself."
east-and-beyond-1973.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The predominant yellow hue in this abstract composition immediately works against any strong sense of sadness; yellow is typically associated with light, warmth, and optimism, making it difficult for melancholic feelings to take hold. There are no figures, narratives, or conventionally sad imagery present that would directly evoke grief, sorrow, or despair. The forms themselves are abstract and somewhat geological, resembling a deep valley or gorge. While the dark, textured areas at the bottom might convey a sense of depth, weight, or even isolation, their starkness is mitigated by the vast, luminous yellow expanse above. There is a slight, almost imperceptible whisper of solemnity in the dark, rugged forms, which could be interpreted by some as a very minor undertone of somber contemplation or the quiet burden of profound depth. However, this is far from an overt feeling of sadness, which is why the score remains very low, acknowledging only the most remote and subtle possible association."
dominican-1952-1.jpg,colorField,25.5,"The primary element contributing to a sense of sadness in this painting is the substantial band of grey at the bottom. Grey is a color commonly associated with melancholy, somberness, neutrality, and a lack of vibrancy, which can evoke feelings of dullness or quiet despondency. Its placement at the very base of the composition might suggest a grounded, perhaps inescapable, feeling of solemnity.

However, any potential for deep sadness is significantly diminished by several factors. The upper half of the painting is dominated by two large fields of yellow, a color overwhelmingly linked to cheerfulness, warmth, and optimism. These bright areas actively counteract and lighten any somberness introduced by the grey. The crisp, clean horizontal lines and the overall geometric, abstract nature of the composition lend a sense of order, balance, and controlled calm rather than emotional turbulence or despair. There are no forms, figures, or narrative elements to suggest loss, grief, or struggle. The thin black line acts as a stark divider, providing a sharp contrast and a sense of absolute separation, which could be interpreted as cold or unfeeling, but not necessarily sad. The white band is largely neutral, contributing to the overall sense of clean minimalism. Therefore, while the grey introduces a faint undertone of sobriety or subdued melancholy, it is heavily outweighed by the brighter colors and the painting's overall composed, serene, and almost intellectual aesthetic, resulting in a very low, almost negligible, evocation of true sadness."
elements-v.jpg,colorField,30.0,"The painting subtly evokes a sense of sadness primarily through its color palette and compositional gravity. The expansive, dark gray/black block occupying the top portion of the canvas creates a distinct feeling of weight, somberness, or even oppression, which can psychologically contribute to a mood of gloom or quiet sorrow. This darkness lacks any light or vibrant accent, reinforcing a sense of absence or void.

Below this heavy expanse, the three vertical stripes feature deep, muted colors: a deep, earthy red; a profound, somber blue; and a subdued, mustard yellow. The dark blue, in particular, is frequently associated with melancholy, introspection, and a quiet sense of pensiveness. While red and yellow can be vibrant, their specific shades here are muted and desaturated, stripping them of any inherent cheerfulness or energetic quality. Instead, they blend into the overall serious and subdued atmosphere.

The rigid, geometric composition, devoid of dynamic movement or figurative elements, offers no narrative to uplift or distract from this weighty, contemplative mood. The overall impression is one of solemnity and quietude, leaning towards a reflective or even melancholic state rather than overt joy or energy. It's not an intense, acute sadness, but rather a pervasive, atmospheric melancholy or a sense of gravitas that can accompany moments of quiet sorrow or resignation."
duo-1965.jpg,colorField,12.0,"The painting, with its abstract forms and minimalist composition, primarily evokes a sense of calm and quietude rather than overt sadness. The dominant large field of muted periwinkle blue creates a spacious and serene atmosphere, which is not inherently melancholic. However, certain elements contribute to a very subtle, almost introspective, quietness that might, for some viewers, carry a hint of solemnity or a gentle, non-distressing melancholy, leading to a very low sadness score.

Specifically, the cool, desaturated palette—featuring the muted blue-grey, the deep teal, and the earthy reddish-orange—contributes to a subdued emotional register. While not somber, these colors lack vibrancy and energy, fostering a contemplative mood that can sometimes lean towards pensiveness. Furthermore, the two distinct, organic shapes, positioned on opposing sides of the large blue expanse, might be interpreted as somewhat isolated or distant from each other. This sense of separation or quiet solitude, rather than active connection, could evoke a very mild feeling of introspection or a gentle awareness of aloneness, which is a subtle facet of sadness.

There are no strong visual cues typically associated with profound sadness, such as heavy darkness, chaotic forms, or symbols of loss or despair. The overall impression is one of harmonious balance and tranquility. Therefore, any perceived sadness is extremely understated, akin to a quiet, reflective moment rather than an experience of grief or sorrow."
farbraum-1963.jpg,colorField,55.0,"The predominant use of soft, diluted blues in this abstract piece immediately evokes a sense of melancholy and introspection, colors widely associated with sadness and contemplation. The diffuse, watercolor-like washes and the gentle bleeding of pigments create a feeling of quiet solitude and perhaps a subtle sense of transience or fading, which can be inherently wistful. The lack of sharp lines or intense contrasts contributes to a subdued atmosphere, suggesting a sadness that is quiet and internal rather than dramatic or acute. The pale, almost empty background and edges further emphasize a sense of space or absence, which can subtly feed into feelings of loneliness or a gentle longing. While the overall impression is serene and somewhat ethereal, it's a serenity that coexists with a palpable undercurrent of blue-tinged sorrow. It's not an overwhelming despair, but rather a quiet, persistent ache, like the gentle melancholy of a rainy day or a deep, introspective moment. The subtle variations in the blue, sometimes appearing slightly granular, add a texture that could be interpreted as reminiscent of tears or a quiet emotional disturbance, though still very much contained."
evening-glow-1972.jpg,colorField,38.0,"The predominant deep indigo blue background strongly contributes to a sense of quiet melancholy and introspection, often associated with feelings of solitude or a subdued emotional state. This vast, enveloping blueness can evoke a feeling of emotional depth or a gentle, pervasive emptiness, which borders on sadness. The small, numerous, and somewhat fragmented shapes scattered across this expanse might be interpreted as isolated entities or quiet struggles against an immense backdrop, subtly hinting at a sense of insignificance or quiet pathos. Furthermore, the gradient of color within these shapes, transitioning from warmer reddish-orange to cooler, almost white tones, could suggest a gradual fading or a loss of vibrancy, which can subtly trigger a feeling of gentle sorrow or a wistful sense of decline. The repetitive, patterned nature of the shapes, while maintaining visual order, also contributes to a sense of quiet persistence or a mild resignation, which can manifest as a low-grade sadness. However, the overall composition does not convey acute distress, loss, or despair, but rather a contemplative and somewhat somber mood."
foley-1967.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting, with its stark, simplified shapes and vibrant primary and secondary colors, offers very little visual information that would typically evoke sadness. The dominant bright yellow background is often associated with cheerfulness and energy, counteracting any potential somberness. While the presence of blue (a color sometimes linked to melancholy) might slightly nudge the emotional needle, the particular shade used here is a light, almost sky-blue, which feels more serene or airy than deeply mournful. The red triangle is vibrant and active, not subdued, and the dark line is a simple, neutral divider. There are no figures expressing sorrow, no desolate landscapes, no somber tones, and no narrative elements that suggest loss, regret, or despair. The composition is balanced and almost playful in its simplicity, aligning more with clarity or abstraction than any form of emotional distress. Any perception of sadness would be highly idiosyncratic and not inherent in the artwork's visual cues; hence, the rating remains very low, accounting only for the slightest, most indirect potential interpretation that might arise from the isolated nature of the shapes for a particularly sensitive viewer, though this is a significant stretch."
gomelza-1965.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The artwork presents an abstract, repetitive pattern composed of stylized cross-like shapes in red and blue against a white background. The forms are rounded and organic, suggesting a flowing or interconnected design rather than anything rigid or sharp. The colors chosen, a vibrant red and a gentle periwinkle blue, are generally not associated with somber or melancholic moods; red often conveys energy or passion, while light blue can evoke calm or spaciousness. There are no elements within the composition—such as specific imagery, distorted forms, dark or muted color palettes, or visual narratives—that typically trigger feelings of sadness or loss. The overall impression is one of rhythmic design and visual balance, which leans away from any emotional resonance of sorrow or distress. While abstract art can sometimes evoke complex emotions, the specific interplay of these shapes and colors in this balanced, decorative pattern does not suggest any inherent sadness; rather, it feels neutral or even slightly uplifting due to its organized vibrancy."
farbraumk-rper-1982.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The painting is dominated by vibrant yellow and gold hues, which are typically associated with warmth, energy, and joy, thereby inherently working against a strong impression of sadness. The overall visual effect is one of luminosity and active texture.

However, a very subtle and almost negligible sense of sadness can be gleaned from a few minor elements. The yellows are not uniformly bright; some areas lean towards more muted, earthy tones like ochre or mustard, which can carry a less purely optimistic feel than brilliant yellows. These are interspersed and sometimes blended with darker, more subdued shades of brown and olive green, particularly noticeable around the edges and within the deeper textures of the painting. These darker, more grounded tones introduce a faint sense of weight, somberness, or perhaps a hint of decay or aging, subtly tempering the overall brightness. This isn't overt gloom, but a very slight undertone that might evoke a contemplative or slightly melancholic mood. Furthermore, while the brushstrokes contribute to a sense of dynamism, some of the visible textures and layering could be interpreted as having a slight roughness or complexity, hinting at an underlying narrative that isn't entirely smooth or carefree, which in a very abstract and indirect way, might touch upon human experiences that include less joyful moments. These factors combine to create a barely"
four-panels-1971.jpg,colorField,18.0,"The emotion of sadness is present in this artwork, but only to a very subtle and understated degree. The primary elements contributing to this low level of sadness are the color choices, specifically the solid black and blue rectangles. Black is universally associated with death, mourning, and emptiness, which are concepts deeply tied to sadness and grief. The intense, opaque black block can evoke a sense of void or solemnity. Similarly, the deep blue color, while often conveying serenity or depth, is also widely associated with melancholy and ""the blues."" These two colors, side-by-side or in combination within a piece, can introduce a quiet somberness.

However, the intensity of this sadness is significantly diluted by several factors. Firstly, the artwork is purely abstract, lacking any narrative, figures, or symbolic imagery that might directly depict or amplify a sense of sadness. There are no downtrodden forms, turbulent brushstrokes, or muted tones that would typically evoke a strong emotional response of sorrow. Secondly, the composition is extremely clean, orderly, and geometric. The crisp edges and precise rectangular forms create a sense of control, balance, and visual clarity rather than distress or emotional turmoil. This visual tidiness works against a feeling of disquiet or grief. Thirdly, the presence of the vibrant, almost energetic green and red rectangles acts as a counterbalance. Green is often associated with nature, renewal, and vitality, while red can evoke passion, energy, or vibrancy. These brighter, more positive or neutral colors prevent the overall mood from sinking into a deeper state of melancholy. The expansive white background also contributes to a sense of lightness and openness, preventing the black and blue from feeling oppressive or overwhelming. Therefore, while a fleeting association with sadness might arise due to the cultural connotations of black and blue, the overall impression of the artwork leans far more towards a study of color and form, exuding a contemplative or purely aesthetic quality rather than a poignant emotional one."
galaxy-1949.jpg,colorField,37.0,"The painting evokes a subtle, pervasive sense of quiet sadness rather than acute grief or despair. This feeling primarily stems from the deep, muted reddish-brown color that dominates the canvas. This particular shade, often referred to as maroon or a dark earthy red, carries a heavy, somber quality; it lacks the vibrancy of pure red and leans towards a desaturated, melancholic tone, reminiscent of old blood, dried earth, or a hushed, contemplative silence. This color alone contributes a significant sense of solemnity and a subdued mood, which can easily be interpreted as a quiet, lingering sorrow.

Furthermore, the composition with its two stark, unyielding vertical brown stripes against the expansive field of the muted red adds to this feeling. These lines are rigid and static, offering no dynamic movement or sense of joy. They could be interpreted as barriers, a sense of confinement, or simply unyielding realities. The large, undifferentiated spaces between and around the stripes contribute to a feeling of emptiness or vast, quiet isolation. This austerity and lack of visual 'comfort' or 'playfulness' lean towards a more introspective and potentially melancholic state. There's an absence of anything bright, uplifting, or overtly emotional, allowing the subdued color and simple, stark forms to convey a sense of solemn contemplation that often accompanies a deep-seated, quiet sadness or resignation. It suggests a weighted stillness, a somber mood that doesn't actively weep but rather endures with a heavy heart."
flute-passage-1975.jpg,colorField,12.5,"The presence of sadness in this painting is extremely subtle and not a dominant emotion. The vast, expansive field of earthy, reddish-brown color that dominates the canvas can be interpreted by some as monotonous, barren, or even desolate, which might evoke a faint sense of emptiness or isolation. The visible, somewhat crude brushstrokes across this large area contribute to a raw, unpolished texture, which could be perceived as stark or unadorned rather than comforting or uplifting. While the colorful diagonal strokes are vibrant, their isolated nature and diagonal orientation, possibly suggesting movement away or a fleeting presence, could subtly hint at a sense of transience or wistfulness against the broad, less dynamic background. However, these are very faint and subjective interpretations. The bright, distinct colors of the strokes themselves (orange, teal, yellow, blue, red) typically convey energy and dynamism, largely counteracting any strong sense of sorrow. The painting lacks traditional visual cues for sadness such as somber tones, drooping forms, or a narrative of loss or struggle, resulting in a very low overall sadness score."
ghana.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting predominantly features a vast expanse of vibrant, intense red, a color typically associated with strong emotions such as passion, energy, or anger, rather than sadness. Sadness in visual art is more commonly evoked through cool, desaturated hues like blues, greys, or muted purples, which are not dominant here. While there are some cooler tones (light blue, lavender, muted green) present in the brushstrokes at the bottom right, they appear as distinct, sharp, and somewhat energetic vertical forms rather than soft, flowing, or somber elements that would convey melancholy or grief. Their stark contrast against the overwhelming red creates a sense of dynamism or fragmented presence rather than sorrow. There are no visual cues such as drooping lines, slumped figures, desolate landscapes, or heavy, muted atmospheric qualities that are traditionally used to convey sadness. The overall impression leans towards an abstract expression of intensity or a bold statement, with an active and assertive visual vocabulary that does not resonate with feelings of sorrow, introspection, or despair. The very low score acknowledges the highly subjective nature of abstract art interpretation, where a viewer might find a subtle sense of being overwhelmed or isolated by the vast red, which could be distantly related to melancholy, but there are no direct or strong visual indicators of sadness presented within the artwork's formal elements."
hommage-to-alfred-jensen-1958.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting presents a vibrant and chaotic interplay of bold colors and energetic splatters against a white background. Dominant colors include bright red, yellow, blue, purple, and stark black. These hues are generally associated with intensity, energy, and dynamism rather than somber emotions. The application of paint, characterized by strong, broad brushstrokes and dynamic splatters, conveys a sense of spontaneous action and uninhibited expression. There are no drooping lines, heavy forms, or muted tones that typically evoke feelings of sorrow, melancholy, or despair. The overall composition is active and visually stimulating, suggesting an outward burst of energy or a playful disarray, which stands in direct contrast to the introspective or subdued nature often linked with sadness. Therefore, there are virtually no visual cues within this artwork that would elicit or represent sadness."
glow-ii-1968.jpg,colorField,72.0,"The painting strongly conveys a sense of sadness through several key elements. Most notably, the prominent vertical blue streak descending from the large, dark central mass immediately evokes the imagery of a tear falling, a direct and potent symbol of sorrow and weeping. This visual metaphor is central to the painting's emotional impact. The large, amorphous dark brown shape in the middle, from which the blue streak emanates, appears heavy and weighty, suggesting a burden, a heavy heart, or an overwhelming presence of grief. Below this, the deep, turbulent blues and purples in the foreground contribute significantly to a somber and melancholic atmosphere. The way these colors bleed, merge, and splatter creates a sense of emotional turmoil, distress, or even a profound outpouring of feeling, like sorrow bleeding into the environment. While the upper portion of the painting features intense yellow and orange hues, these vibrant colors serve to create a dramatic contrast with the dark, heavy, and emotionally charged lower half, perhaps highlighting the intensity of the sorrow rather than diminishing it. The overall impression is one of a deep, impactful, and almost raw emotional state, with the visual cues collectively painting a picture of significant sadness."
in-croce-iii-1969.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract composition is characterized by a vibrant and dynamic interplay of colors and shapes. The dominant hues are bright and warm, including various shades of yellow, orange, red, and green, interspersed with blues and pinks, all set against a neutral, earthy beige background. The forms are a mix of sharp geometric angles and organic, irregular blobs, creating a sense of movement and visual energy. There are transparent-like overlays of yellow and orange, suggesting luminosity and depth. The overall impression is one of visual complexity, brightness, and vitality. There are no somber tones, muted colors, heavy forms, or chaotic elements that would typically evoke feelings of sorrow, melancholy, despair, or loss. The painting's aesthetic leans towards an engaging, almost joyful, or intellectually stimulating experience, completely devoid of any visual cues that might trigger sadness."
green-painting-2006.jpg,colorField,38.0,"The dominant deep, muted green hue of the painting creates a pervasive sense of solemnity and quiet introspection, which can readily align with feelings of sadness. This particular shade, devoid of vibrant light or overt warmth, often evokes a weighty or somber mood, suggesting a sense of absorption or a heavy heart. The monochromatic field, without any discernible subject or narrative, encourages a focus on the emotional resonance of the color itself, fostering a feeling of solitude or perhaps a subdued sense of melancholy. The slight imperfections, visible brushstrokes, and subtle drips along the bottom edge can be interpreted as a slow, almost resigned downward movement, hinting at a quiet, persistent sadness rather than an explosive or acute form of grief. While not explicitly depicting sorrow through figurative elements, the overall visual stillness and depth of color contribute to an atmosphere that feels quietly despondent or contemplative, leaning towards a subtle, underlying current of sadness. However, it lacks the sharp contrasts, dramatic movement, or overt symbolism that would elicit a more intense emotional response of despair or profound sorrow."
green-giant-1980.jpg,colorField,22.0,"The painting, an abstract work, evokes a very subtle and understated sense of sadness, rather than an overt or overwhelming expression of the emotion. The dominant green background, while not inherently sad, is a muted and deep shade, creating a somewhat solemn or tranquil atmosphere. The primary contributors to any perceived sadness are the vertical black lines on the right side of the canvas. Black is a color often associated with absence, void, finality, and mourning. Their starkness and repetition against the green background can suggest a sense of weight, solemnity, or an unyielding reality that might induce a quiet melancholy or a pensive mood.

Furthermore, the contrasting set of thinner, less defined, lighter green-blue lines on the left, compared to the bold black lines, could subtly suggest something fading, lost, or less substantial. This visual disparity might evoke a faint sense of something missing or less vibrant, contributing to a feeling of gentle wistfulness. The clear separation between these two distinct blocks of lines could also be interpreted as a visual metaphor for isolation, disconnection, or an irreparable division, themes that can"
il-labirinto-della-psiche-1986.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The emotion of sadness is largely absent in this abstract composition. The dominant use of a rich, vibrant green color throughout the canvas tends to evoke feelings of nature, growth, vitality, and tranquility rather than sorrow or melancholy. There are no muted, somber, or cold tones (like deep blues, greys, or browns often associated with sadness) that dominate the palette.

Furthermore, the shapes within the painting are organic, fluid, and interconnected, resembling biomorphic forms or an abstract landscape. These flowing lines and complete, rounded shapes do not convey fragmentation, brokenness, isolation, or distress, which might otherwise contribute to a sense of sadness. Instead, they suggest continuity, harmony, and natural processes.

There are no discernible figures, faces, or narrative elements that would typically depict or evoke sadness (e.g., loneliness, grief, despair, or desolation). The small black, blue, and yellow accents at the bottom, while providing a point of interest, do not carry any inherent emotional weight of sadness. The overall visual impression leans towards contemplation, serenity, and a dynamic sense of organic life, leaving very little room for an interpretation of sadness. Any minimal score would be due to the highly subjective nature of abstract art interpretation, where one might project a fleeting, ungrounded sense of solemnity, but it is not directly supported by the visual cues."
hydra-1981.jpg,colorField,75.0,"The artwork evokes a palpable sense of sadness, rooted deeply in its color palette, composition, and textural qualities. The central, dominant block of muted blue-grey is the most significant contributor; this particular shade of blue is inherently associated with melancholy, introspection, and a quiet sense of sorrow. Its large, flat, and somewhat scuffed appearance conveys a heavy, almost somber presence that feels weighty and resigned.

The overall desaturated and neutral tones of the other sections – the off-white/beige and the dark grey/brown bands – further amplify this feeling by denying any sense of vibrancy, joy, or lightness. They create an austere and subdued atmosphere that fosters introspection and quietude, often fertile ground for melancholic feelings. The dark, heavily textured bands at the top, particularly in the middle and right sections, can be interpreted as heavy skies or oppressive burdens, adding to the gravitas and sorrowful mood.

Compositionally, the stark, tripartite division of the piece, with its distinct vertical separations, can suggest isolation, fragmentation, or a brokenness that resonates with sadness. The forms are rigid and unyielding, contributing to a sense of solemnity. Furthermore, the visible textures, including subtle scratches, rough edges, and what appear to be worn surfaces, introduce a sense of vulnerability, imperfection, and perhaps decay or the passage of time, which can inherently evoke a quiet sadness or a nostalgic longing for what once was. The torn, organic edges of the paper itself add to this raw, fragile quality, enhancing the overall feeling of a subdued and enduring sorrow rather than a sudden burst of grief. The absence of any dynamic movement or bright light emphasizes a pervasive and quiet despondency."
infinity-field-lefkada-series-for-c-d-friedrich-1981.jpg,colorField,48.5,"The painting evokes a discernible, though not overwhelming, sense of sadness primarily through its dominant color palette and atmospheric qualities. The prevalence of deep, cool hues—indigo, muted purples, and somber blues—are traditionally associated with introspection, melancholy, and a general feeling of low emotional energy. The large, expansive central band of dark, textured indigo creates a heavy visual weight and a sense of vastness or emptiness that can resonate with feelings of solitude or a subdued state of mind.

The subtle variations within these dark tones, visible in the crops, prevent the area from being monolithic, but rather add to its quiet depth, allowing for a contemplation that can easily lean into wistfulness or quiet sorrow. The irregular, somewhat jagged, and broken lines that define the boundaries between the color fields, particularly the prominent white-blue line at the top, subtly introduce a sense of disruption or unease rather than smooth tranquility, which can subtly hint at an underlying melancholic tension.

There is an absence of warm, vibrant colors or energetic forms that would uplift the mood. Instead, the overall impression is one of quietude and subdued emotion, akin to a pensive, melancholic state rather than an acute or despairing sadness. It's a sadness that is atmospheric and contemplative, inviting a somber reflection rather than an overt expression of grief."
jasper-s-dilemma-1972.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork is an abstract, geometric composition featuring two large squares, each filled with concentric squares made of alternating bands of color. The left square utilizes a diverse and somewhat vibrant palette of blues, oranges, reds, greens, and purples, while the right square uses a monochrome scale of greys, blacks, and whites. There are no discernible figures, narrative elements, or thematic suggestions within the piece that could evoke feelings of sadness, sorrow, or melancholy. The clean lines, systematic patterns, and repetitive forms are more indicative of optical effects, formal exploration, and visual rhythm rather than emotional expression. Neither the bright, varied colors nor the subdued monochrome tones, in this context, convey a sense of dejection or unhappiness. The artwork is devoid of any visual cues—such as a somber atmosphere, distorted forms, or evocative subject matter—that would typically be associated with the emotion of sadness. Therefore, there is no discernible presence of sadness in this painting."
leuchtrot-und-gelb-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, characterized by its vibrant hot pink and bright orange hues, exhibits no visual elements that would typically evoke sadness. The color palette itself is energetic and bold, commonly associated with excitement, warmth, or intensity, rather than melancholy, somberness, or despair. There are no cool, muted, or dark tones that might suggest a downcast mood. The composition is simple and geometric, featuring a central orange square set within a larger pink field. This abstract, non-representational form lacks any narrative or figural elements that could convey emotional states like grief or sorrow. The clean lines and balanced structure do not create any sense of tension, discomfort, or isolation. Furthermore, there are no visual cues such as downward lines, heavy forms, or a desolate atmosphere often employed to represent sadness in art. The overall impression is one of visual vibrancy and possibly contemplation through color interaction, entirely devoid of any suggestion of sadness or emotional weight."
istria-v-2011.jpg,colorField,68.5,"The painting strongly evokes sadness through its predominant use of cool, muted tones, particularly various shades of blue and purple. These colors are frequently associated with melancholy, introspection, and sorrow, creating an immediate and palpable somber atmosphere. The soft, diffused blending of colors throughout the canvas, with an almost hazy or misty quality, contributes to a sense of wistfulness and a quiet, internalized emotional state, rather than a vibrant or energetic one. There are no sharp lines or bright, uplifting contrasts; instead, the transitions are gentle and subtle, which can convey a persistent, lingering sadness rather than a sudden or acute one. The subtle shift from lighter tones at the top to deeper, more saturated hues towards the bottom and right can be interpreted as a gradual immersion into a heavier emotional depth. Furthermore, the delicate, slightly irregular or ""frayed"" edges, visible in the crops, and the overall grainy texture, suggest a sense of fragility or vulnerability, which often accompanies feelings of sadness. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and profound, yet gentle, melancholy, devoid of any overt cheerfulness or dynamic energy."
isis.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The painting evokes a very low degree of sadness, bordering on a subtle, contemplative melancholy rather than overt sorrow. The muted and somewhat desaturated color palette, particularly in the upper sections with the dark olive green, deep grey-blue, and muted gold, contributes to a subdued atmosphere lacking vibrant energy. This absence of vivacity can lean towards a quiet or introspective mood, which for some viewers, might carry a faint undertone of melancholy. Furthermore, the diffused, hazy edges around the color bands create a soft, ethereal quality that could be interpreted as things fading, blurring, or existing in a distant, dreamlike state. This sense of impermanence or gentle obscurity might evoke a fleeting feeling of nostalgia or a quiet wistfulness.

However, the overall impression is far from sorrowful. There are no harsh contrasts, jagged lines, or oppressive dark tones that typically signify strong sadness. The progression of colors, especially moving into the lighter, softer greens and the gentle lavender at the bottom, introduces a sense of calm, natural serenity, and even a subtle, unfolding transition that counters any profound sense of distress. The composition feels balanced and harmonious, leading more towards a meditative state than one of grief or unhappiness. Therefore, any sadness felt would be extremely mild, fleeting, and deeply intertwined with a sense of quiet reflection rather than an overwhelming emotional response."
loves-power-1982.jpg,colorField,3.5,"The painting registers extremely low on the scale for sadness due to its predominant use of warm, vibrant colors. The large, dominant block of bright yellow inherently evokes feelings of energy, optimism, and cheerfulness, which are antithetical to sorrow. Similarly, the rich, earthy reds and oranges contribute to a sense of warmth, grounding, and passion rather than melancholy or despair. There is a notable absence of cool, desaturated tones such as deep blues, grays, or heavy blacks, which are commonly associated with sadness or somber moods in art. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the forms means there is no discernible narrative or figural depiction that could convey a story of loss, grief, or hardship. The composition, while featuring somewhat weighty color blocks, does not create a sense of oppression or emptiness. Instead, the overall impression is one of bold color and robust presence. While abstract art can be deeply subjective, there are no visual cues—such as drooping lines, broken forms, or specific symbolic elements—that would guide a viewer towards an emotional interpretation of sadness. The painting feels vibrant and composed, offering no direct pathways to feelings of sorrow or melancholy."
lure-ii-1976.jpg,colorField,5.2,"The painting predominantly features a reddish-brown, earthy tone with two vertical, parallel lines of a bright, somewhat desaturated green. The overall impression is one of stark simplicity and abstract form. There are very few elements within this artwork that actively convey or evoke sadness.

The color palette, while not overtly joyful, does not lean towards melancholic or despairing tones. The reddish-brown can be perceived as warm, earthy, or grounding, rather than somber or depressing. The green lines are relatively vibrant and fresh, providing a contrast that feels more vital than mournful. There are no dark, heavy shadows, muted greys, or cool blues often associated with sadness.

The composition is minimalist and balanced, featuring two distinct, upright lines. This creates a sense of order and stillness, which can be contemplative or serene, but not inherently sad. There is no narrative, no discernible figures or objects that could be interpreted as experiencing sorrow, loss, or pain. The lines are unbroken and stable, lacking any visual indication of distress or fragility.

While the simplicity and the somewhat worn edges of the painted board might evoke a sense of age or quiet solitude, these are not strong enough to register a significant feeling of sadness. The piece is largely neutral in its emotional charge regarding sorrow, and if anything, leans more towards a calm, meditative, or purely aesthetic appreciation of color and form. Any interpretation of sadness would require a significant projection from the viewer, rather than being a direct evocation by the artwork's inherent visual cues. Therefore, the score is very low, indicating a near absence of sadness conveyed by the painting itself."
low-white-sun-box-1965.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The painting primarily evokes a sense of calm, spaciousness, and contemplation rather than overt sadness. The dominant colors are light, airy off-whites, creams, and pale yellows, which typically convey luminosity and serenity rather than melancholy or despair. The large, soft fields of color contribute to an ethereal and quiet atmosphere.

While the prominent horizontal blue band could, for some viewers, evoke a sense of ""feeling blue"" or represent a distant, perhaps melancholic horizon, its color is a relatively vibrant and clear blue, not a deep, brooding, or muted shade that would typically signify profound sorrow. Furthermore, this blue is anchored and surrounded by vast expanses of light, almost luminous tones above and below it. The small, thin yellow horizontal line above the blue adds a subtle touch of warmth, light, or perhaps a fleeting moment of brightness, which subtly counteracts any potential somberness.

The overall composition is balanced and still, creating a meditative mood. There are no harsh lines, dark shadows, or chaotic forms that might suggest distress or sorrow. The feeling is more akin to looking at a vast, quiet landscape at dawn or dusk, evoking introspection rather than grief. Any potential for sadness is extremely subtle and easily overshadowed by the painting's overall tranquil and light-filled character."
magus-1981.jpg,colorField,18.0,"The painting predominantly features a palette of soft pinks, peaches, and muted reds, which generally evoke feelings of warmth, gentleness, or introspection rather than sorrow. While there are subtle hints of muted blues and greys, particularly in the central left area and upper central part, these cool tones are largely overwhelmed by the warmer hues. The soft, blended brushwork and the overall abstract composition create a sense of quietude and calm. There are no sharp, jarring lines, turbulent forms, or heavily desaturated colors that typically communicate distress, despair, or deep sorrow. The small, vibrant red accent in the upper right quadrant of the central rectangle acts more as a point of interest or a spark than a symbol of pain or grief. The bright pink border framing the entire artwork also contributes to a somewhat contained and less somber overall impression. Therefore, while a very subtle hint of quiet pensiveness or gentle melancholy might be inferred from the cooler tones and the subdued nature of the painting, the pervasive warmth and softness prevent any significant feeling of sadness from emerging. The emotion is very low, almost imperceptible as overt sadness."
midnight-watch-1976.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting, composed of numerous vertical stripes in varying widths and a diverse palette of colors, evokes a sense of order, rhythm, and perhaps even a gentle vibrancy rather than sadness. The colors used are predominantly light and cool tones such as various shades of blue, green, and lavender, interspersed with brighter elements like pale yellow and soft pink. Traditionally, sadness in art is often conveyed through darker, muted, or somber color schemes, heavy brushstrokes, or narrative elements depicting loss or melancholy. None of these characteristics are present here. The light and airy quality of the colors, particularly the yellows and pinks, counteract any potential for the blues or grays to evoke deep sorrow. The precise, vertical lines create a harmonious and stable composition, devoid of any drooping forms or chaotic elements that might suggest despair or emotional turmoil. The overall impression is one of gentle calm or a subdued cheerfulness, making it highly unlikely to trigger feelings of sadness in a viewer. Any minimal score for sadness would stem purely from the subjective and abstract nature of the piece, where any emotion might be minimally projected, rather than from any inherent visual cues within the artwork itself."
medeanus.jpg,colorField,33.0,"The painting conveys a subtle and introspective sense of sadness rather than an overt or profound sorrow. This feeling emerges primarily from the use of certain colors and the nature of the forms. The large, dark blue-black shape on the right side, with its thick, somber outline, carries a significant visual weight, suggesting containment or a deep, internalized emotion. The small, bright blue dot within this dark mass can be interpreted as a concentrated point of feeling, perhaps a quiet tear or a pool of melancholy.

Furthermore, the muted grey area in the upper left quadrant and the soft, almost faded grey-white form at the bottom, which also features a dab of blue, contribute to a subdued and contemplative atmosphere. These forms appear somewhat isolated and without strong connection to the other elements, which can subtly suggest a feeling of loneliness or quiet introspection. The soft, fuzzy, almost ""bled"" edges around several of the color fields, especially the red and the dark blue-black shapes, create a sense of vulnerability and a gentle, blurred emotional state, aligning with a tender, non-aggressive form of sadness or wistfulness.

However, the expansive and dominant bright yellow on the right side, along with the vibrant red form, actively counteracts any overwhelming sense of gloom, introducing warmth and vitality that prevent the painting from feeling deeply melancholic or despairing. Therefore, the sadness present is a quiet, contemplative melancholy, a subdued undercurrent rather than an all-encompassing emotion."
maple-grove-2008.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting, composed of three minimalist panels in varying shades of chartreuse and olive green, evokes virtually no sense of sadness. The dominant color, green, is typically associated with nature, growth, renewal, and vitality, rather than melancholy or sorrow. While some muted or desaturated greens might hint at sickness or decay, the hues present here, particularly the central panel which is quite vibrant and yellowish-green, are too fresh and bright to convey such negative connotations.

Furthermore, the composition consists of simple, geometric rectangles, devoid of any narrative elements, human figures, or discernible scenes that could traditionally depict loss, grief, or emotional struggle. There are no drooping lines, heavy forms, or chaotic brushstrokes that might suggest turmoil. Instead, the clean lines and orderly arrangement contribute to a sense of calm, balance, or neutrality. The lighting is even and bright, casting subtle shadows that give depth but do not create a somber or oppressive atmosphere.

Any perception of sadness from this artwork would be highly subjective and atypical, perhaps stemming from a viewer's personal and unusual association with the specific color or the stark simplicity of the forms, suggesting emptiness or absence. However, on an objective and widely understood basis of art interpretation, the visual language employed in this piece overwhelmingly lacks the conventional cues (such as cool, dark, or desaturated colors, agitated or downtrodden forms, or a tragic subject matter) that typically evoke sadness. Therefore, the feeling of sadness is almost entirely absent."
mother-e-2009.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The overall impression of this image is one of minimalist abstraction, featuring two large, solid color fields – a vibrant blue on the left and a rich green on the right – set against a light, neutral wall. When evaluating sadness specifically, there are very few elements within this artwork that actively convey or evoke this emotion.

The colors themselves, while not overtly joyous, are not melancholic or somber. The blue is a clear, rather bright hue, far from the deep, desaturated, or muted blues often associated with profound sadness or melancholy. Instead, it leans towards a sense of calm or even a subtle energy. Similarly, the green is a natural, almost earthy tone, lacking the sickly or dull quality that might contribute to a feeling of malaise or despair. Neither color is dark, oppressive, or heavy in a way that typically resonates with sorrow.

The composition is incredibly simple: two unadorned rectangles. There are no narrative elements, no figures displaying distress, no symbolic forms of loss, nor any chaotic or unsettling textures that might create a sense of unease or emotional weight. The clean lines and uniform surfaces suggest order and clarity rather than disarray or emotional turmoil. The lighting is even and bright, further preventing any shadow-induced gloom or somber atmosphere.

While some might argue that the starkness or the sheer absence of human presence or narrative could lead to a feeling of emptiness or isolation, which can be linked to sadness, this connection is tenuous and highly subjective for this particular image. The primary impression is one of formal simplicity and color study, rather than an intentional emotional statement, especially not one geared towards sadness. The simplicity is more likely to be perceived as meditative or neutral, rather than depressing. Any feeling of sadness would be projected onto the artwork by the viewer, rather than being inherently suggested by its visual properties. Therefore, the score is very low, reflecting a near-absence of direct cues for sadness."
new-morning-1996.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of sadness. The dominant visual elements—three luminous, perfectly circular forms in vibrant hues of coral/reddish-pink, bright orange, and vivid blue—are overwhelmingly associated with energy, warmth, and vitality, rather than somber emotions. The soft, radiant glow emanating from each circle creates an ethereal and almost celebratory atmosphere, suggesting light and possibility rather than despair or gloom. The background, composed of textured, light, almost white or pale gray tones, is neutral and does not contribute any melancholic depth or somberness. There are no dark colors, broken forms, solitary figures, or narrative cues typically linked to sadness, loss, or grief. The harmonious arrangement and bright, inviting palette lead to an experience that is far removed from any feeling of sorrow or melancholy."
mohawk-1970.jpg,colorField,38.5,"The painting evokes a subtle sense of sadness, bordering on gentle melancholy, primarily due to its muted and desaturated color palette. A significant portion of the vertical stripes consists of cool tones such as various shades of blue, purple, and muted green, interspersed with an array of grays and earthy browns. These colors, while not overtly dark or gloomy, lack vibrancy and brilliance, contributing to a subdued and introspective atmosphere. The absence of bright, warm, or highly contrasting colors prevents any feeling of joy, excitement, or dynamism. Instead, the consistent repetition and orderly arrangement of these somber, contemplative hues create a quiet, almost pensive mood. There is nothing within the composition that suggests overwhelming sorrow or despair; rather, the sadness conveyed is a soft, reflective quality, reminiscent of a quiet, perhaps slightly wistful, state of mind. The visual effect is calming but leans towards seriousness and a lack of cheerfulness, thereby registering a mild yet discernible degree of sadness."
munich-olympic-games-poster-1972.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The visual elements within this poster do not evoke any sense of sadness. The color palette is composed of bright, vibrant, and saturated hues (orange, purple, green, yellow, blue, pink, black), which are typically associated with energy, dynamism, and joy rather than melancholy or sorrow. There are no muted tones, somber shades, or desaturated colors that might suggest a feeling of sadness. Furthermore, the composition consists of bold, sweeping, and overlapping curved lines, creating a sense of movement, flow, and perhaps even playfulness. These lines ascend and curve, lacking any downward, heavy, or stagnant forms that could imply sadness or despair. There is an overall impression of vitality and abstract motion. The brushstroke-like texture, while visible, adds to the artistic energy rather than conveying distress or gloom. The context of the Olympic Games, an event generally associated with celebration, competition, and international unity, further reinforces an upbeat and positive visual message, with no inherent visual cues in the artwork itself to suggest sadness. Therefore, based purely on the visual information presented, the painting registers an almost complete absence of sadness. The score is not zero because complete absence is theoretically impossible, but it is as close to zero as perceivable from the visual cues."
nexx-central-revisited-1996.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting exhibits no visual cues typically associated with the emotion of sadness. Its vibrant and luminous color palette, featuring a clear, bright blue background contrasted with energetic white brushstrokes and three glowing, richly colored circles (purple, yellow, and fuchsia), evokes feelings of light, vitality, and perhaps spiritual elevation, rather than melancholy or sorrow. There are no dark, muted, or somber tones that would induce a sense of dejection. The composition is open and balanced, with the circular forms radiating light, suggesting expansion and energy rather than contraction or despair. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the artwork presents no discernible figures or narratives that might convey a sense of loss, grief, or suffering. The brushwork, though textural, feels dynamic and airy, contributing to an overall impression of lightness and movement, which stands in direct opposition to the heavy, static, or somber qualities often linked with sadness. Therefore, the painting offers no visual or emotional connection to the feeling of sadness."
janela-aberta-1998.jpg,colorField,35.5,"The overall collection of small paintings evokes a subtle, pervasive sense of melancholy rather than overt sadness or despair. This feeling is primarily conveyed through several recurring elements:

1.  **Recurring Theme of Empty Interiors:** A significant number of the individual panels depict empty, often stark, interior spaces or rooms. These rooms frequently lack inhabitants, furniture, or clear signs of activity, creating a strong sense of absence, isolation, or loneliness. An empty room can metaphorically suggest a void or an overlooked space, leading to feelings of quiet desolation.
2.  **Somber Color Palette within Warm Tones:** While reds and oranges are predominant and can signify warmth or passion, they are often rendered in deep, muted, or earthy tones (like brick red, burnt orange, and deep brown-reds). These are frequently juxtaposed with or heavily incorporate dark blues, blacks, and deep browns. This combination creates shadows, depth, and a weighted atmosphere that can feel somber or heavy, rather than purely vibrant or energetic. The dark corners and enclosed forms in many ""room"" paintings contribute to a feeling of confinement or introversion, which can lean towards sadness.
3.  **Lack of Overt Joyful Elements:** There are no discernible figures expressing joy, no bright, open landscapes (except for one green field), and no clear narratives of happiness or exuberance. The compositions are generally abstract or semi-abstract, focusing on form, color, and space in a way that is more contemplative and subdued than uplifting.
4.  **Quiet and Contemplative Mood:** The repetitive grid format, combined with the introspective subject matter of many panels, establishes a quiet,"
no-24.jpg,colorField,55.0,"The painting evokes a palpable, though subtle and contemplative, sense of sadness. This emotion stems primarily from the muted and earthy color palette, dominated by a deep, somber green and a rich, burnt orange. These shades, particularly the green, possess a certain gravitas and depth that can feel heavy or introspective, rather than vibrant or joyful. The soft, blurred edges of the color blocks contribute to this feeling, creating a sense of diffusion and ambiguity that can be associated with the ephemeral nature of feelings or the quiet melancholy of fading light. There's an absence of sharp, energetic lines or bright, uplifting hues, which steers the emotional tone towards solemnity and introspection. While not an acute or despairing sadness, the composition fosters a mood of quiet contemplation that often borders on melancholy, suggesting a profound emotional space where solemnity and a gentle, pervasive sadness reside. The scale and immersive nature of Rothko's work often invite deep emotional engagement, and in this piece, the prevailing atmosphere is one of profound, perhaps existential, quietude that leans perceptibly towards a dignified sadness."
no-6-yellow-white-blue-over-yellow-on-gray-1954.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The primary contributor to the sensation of sadness in this painting is the large, deep, and heavily saturated blue rectangle at the bottom. Blue, particularly such a profound and resonant shade, is widely associated with feelings of melancholy, introspection, and quiet sorrow. Its substantial visual weight anchors the composition in a somber register, creating a sense of gravity and depth that can evoke a profound, reflective sadness. The soft, bleeding edges of the blue field, characteristic of Rothko's style, allow the color to seep into the viewer's emotional space, creating an atmospheric quality that is conducive to contemplation and potentially, a gentle ache of melancholy. The sheer scale and presence of this blue block invite a deep, quiet immersion that can easily lead to a state of solemnity or a tender sense of loss.

While the luminous yellow and cream-colored blocks above it introduce elements of light and expansion, which might suggest hope or transcendence, they do not entirely negate the powerful undertow of the deep blue. Instead, they create a tension, where the vast, almost ethereal upper fields contrast with the grounding, emotionally weighted blue below. This juxtaposition can amplify the feeling of solemnity, as if a bright, expansive world exists above a deep, contemplative emotional state. The overall meditative quality of the composition allows for the absorption of this profound blue, enabling a significant, though not overwhelming, experience of sadness. It is a sadness that feels contemplative and enduring, rather than sharp or acute."
no-2.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting, with its dominant fields of vibrant yellows and warm oranges, primarily evokes feelings of warmth, energy, and luminosity, rather than sadness. These colors are traditionally associated with joy, optimism, and vitality. There is an absence of visual cues typically linked to sorrow, such as cool, dark, or muted tones (e.g., deep blues, grays, or somber purples), heavy forms, or a sense of despair and desolation. While the painting is abstract and can invite highly personal emotional responses, its overall disposition leans towards an expansive, contemplative, and even uplifting mood. The bright red horizontal band, though intense, acts more as a powerful focal point or a line of vitality rather than conveying pain, grief, or a wound in a mournful sense. Any potential hint of sadness would be extremely subtle and indirect, perhaps emerging from the abstract vastness suggesting human insignificance or the ephemeral nature of light and color, but this is a far cry from a direct or strong evocation of sorrow. The painting lacks the somber visual weight or emotionally charged narrative elements that typically communicate sadness."
oe-260-1957.jpg,colorField,28.0,"The painting evokes a subtle and contemplative sense of sadness, primarily stemming from the large, dark, central amorphous shape. This deep, almost black form, with hints of very dark blue and purple within its depths, carries a significant visual weight and a somber presence. It appears as a heavy, perhaps overwhelming, mass or a profound void. This weightiness can be interpreted as a metaphorical representation of a burden, a deep thought, or a quiet, internalized sorrow. The stark contrast between this dark, weighty core and the surrounding vibrant field of reds and magentas further emphasizes its solemnity. While the reds are energetic, they serve to highlight the isolated and profound nature of the dark shape, almost as if a heavy presence exists within a lively, dynamic environment. This creates a feeling not of overt despair or grief, but rather a muted melancholy, a sense of gravity, or a profound introspective mood. The sadness is not aggressive or overt but rather a deep, quiet undercurrent, a feeling of ponderousness that invites contemplation rather than immediate emotional distress."
november-1963-iii-1963.jpg,colorField,70.0,"The painting evokes a palpable sense of sadness primarily through its stark color palette and compositional elements. The dominant expanse of deep black and somber, dark blue in the lower half of the image creates an immediate impression of immense weight, emptiness, and solemnity. Black is universally associated with grief, despair, and a profound absence, and its substantial presence here contributes heavily to a feeling of deep-seated sorrow or a heavy heart. The dark blue further reinforces this melancholic atmosphere, suggesting introspection and a quiet despondency.

Above these heavy, dark masses, a distinct, somewhat irregular band of reddish-orange cuts across the canvas. This vivid color, while not inherently sad, acts as a stark, almost wounding, line of demarcation. It separates the oppressive darkness below from the vast, empty expanse of white above. This division can be interpreted as a separation, a barrier, or even a deep emotional scar, contributing to a sense of loss or profound isolation often linked with sadness. The slightly rough or creased texture visible within this orange band and extending into the white suggests a lack of pristine smoothness, hinting at imperfections, burdens, or emotional wear.

The large field of stark white at the top, while often associated with purity, here feels more like an overwhelming emptiness or a void, especially when contrasted with the density of the dark colors below. This vast, unoccupied space can amplify feelings of loneliness or a poignant absence, further leaning into a melancholic state. The overall impression is one of quiet, profound sorrow, a heavy emotional landscape devoid of lightness or joy, conveying a significant degree of sadness that is both contemplative and somber."
not_detected_242128.jpg,colorField,70.0,"The emotion of sadness is evoked quite strongly in this painting, primarily through the dominant use of a deep, pervasive purple/indigo hue in the upper and central portion of the canvas. This particular shade is profoundly somber and weighty, often associated with solemnity, contemplation, and a sense of melancholy. Its sheer volume creates an enveloping atmosphere that feels heavy and introspective.

The soft, blurred edges of the color fields contribute to this feeling of sadness by suggesting a dissolving or fading quality, evoking a sense of impermanence or loss, rather than sharp, defined joy. This ethereal quality can make the sadness feel pervasive and atmospheric.

While there is a lighter, warm yellow/cream block at the bottom, its comparatively smaller size and the overwhelming presence of the dark purple above it create a visual tension. The dark field appears immense and almost consuming, with the lighter element serving as a more fragile or subdued counterpoint. This dynamic can suggest a feeling of being overshadowed or consumed by a deep, quiet sorrow. The abstract nature, devoid of specific narratives, allows the viewer to project their own feelings, and the profound, dark color field powerfully guides that projection towards a state of deep, contemplative sadness."
ohne-titel-for-thomas-merton-1971.jpg,colorField,12.5,"The overall impression of this painting does not strongly evoke sadness. The dominant use of vibrant orange and deep, rich blue creates a powerful and energetic contrast rather than a melancholic one. While blue is a color often associated with sadness or melancholy, the specific shade employed here is a robust, almost royal blue that conveys depth and stability rather than despondency or sorrow. It feels more profound or foundational than somber. The strong horizontal divisions, while creating distinct fields, do not suggest isolation or despair. There are no drooping lines, somber tones, or narrative elements that typically convey sadness. The application of paint, with its visible brushstrokes and slightly raw edges, gives it a direct, unvarnished quality that feels more about presence and color interaction than emotional distress. Any fleeting sense of sadness derived from the blue would be a very subtle and secondary interpretation, overshadowed by the painting's overall vibrancy and compositional strength."
paisagem-mayor-2009.jpg,colorField,2.5,"The visual elements in this collection of abstract paintings convey very little, if any, sense of sadness. The dominant palette is vibrant and rich, featuring a wide spectrum of bold and saturated colors such as bright reds, energetic yellows, vivid blues, lively greens, and striking fuchsias. These colors are generally associated with excitement, joy, warmth, or vitality, rather than melancholy or despair. While some paintings incorporate darker tones like deep reds, blacks, or dark blues, they are often used in contrast with or applied over brighter hues, creating a sense of drama or intensity rather than somberness.

The brushstrokes are largely visible, gestural, and appear to have been applied with energy and dynamism. There are instances of thick impasto and bold sweeps of color, which suggest activity and expression rather than a quiet or subdued emotional state. The abstract nature of the pieces means there is no narrative or discernible subject matter that might inherently evoke sorrow. Instead, the forms are non-representational, focusing on color and texture.

The overall presentation, with multiple pieces of varying sizes arranged on a clean white background, creates a lively and engaging display that emphasizes diversity and visual interest. There is no sense of isolation, brokenness, or desolation in the composition as a whole. While abstract art is open to personal interpretation, the overwhelming visual cues in terms of color, movement, and overall vibrancy actively work against the evocation of sadness. Any trace of solemnity or a muted mood is quickly overcome by the collection's predominant energy and chromatic intensity, leading to a very low score for sadness."
papier-d-coup-1967.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting exhibits virtually no elements that typically evoke sadness. The color palette is composed of bright, primary, and energetic hues – red, yellow, and a vibrant teal/blue – which generally convey dynamism or cheerfulness rather than melancholy. There are no dark, muted, or somber tones often associated with sorrow or despair. The composition is highly geometric and repetitive, featuring diagonal strokes arranged in a grid-like pattern. This structure tends to create a sense of order, rhythm, or even playful simplicity, rather than struggle, desolation, or solemnity. Furthermore, the artwork is entirely abstract, lacking any narrative elements, figures, or symbolic imagery that could represent loss, grief, or suffering. There are no drooping lines, heavy forms, or expressions of pain or resignation. The overall impression is one of visual exploration of form and color, an almost systematic or meditative repetition, which stands in stark contrast to any sentiment of sadness. The clean, direct application of paint and the bright background further contribute to an atmosphere devoid of emotional weight or gloom."
painting-1-75-1975.jpg,colorField,90.5,"The painting powerfully evokes sadness primarily through its masterful use of color, form, and texture. The dominant feature is the expansive, deep, and muted reddish-brown (almost a dark maroon or sepia) central rectangle. This color choice is inherently somber, conveying a profound sense of weight, gravity, and introspection. Unlike vibrant or light colors, this deep hue lacks any uplifting qualities and immediately sets a melancholic tone.

The sheer visual mass and density of this dark block occupy the majority of the canvas, creating a sense of heaviness and containment that can feel oppressive or overwhelming, mirroring the burden of sadness. There is an almost palpable feeling of a heavy curtain drawn, or a dense, unyielding presence.

Furthermore, the visible brushstrokes within the dark rectangle are not smooth or uniform but possess a rough, layered quality. These strokes add texture and a sense of internal movement or agitation, suggesting a deeply felt emotion that is contained but not entirely still. They lend a raw, unrefined quality that aligns with the raw, often unarticulated feeling of sadness. The absence of light or sharp contrasts within this central mass further contributes to a gloomy and introverted atmosphere.

The slightly lighter, more faded reddish-brown border that frames the central dark block accentuates its depth and isolation. This border doesn't offer a sense of escape or contrast, but rather reinforces the overall subdued and muted palette, suggesting a world seen through a veil of sorrow, where even the surrounding reality is softened and desaturated by the central emotion. The painting abstains from any narrative elements or figures, allowing its abstract form and somber palette to directly transmit a mood of deep melancholy and quiet sorrow, making it a very effective evocation of sadness."
only-orange-1963.jpg,colorField,5.2,"The painting evokes very little, if any, sense of sadness. Its abstract nature means there is no explicit narrative or imagery of loss, grief, or suffering. The dominant color palette, featuring a warm, vibrant orange and a rich, bold red/magenta, tends to elicit feelings of energy, warmth, or passion rather than sorrow or melancholy. There are no cool, dark, or muted tones typically associated with a somber mood.

The forms themselves are fluid, organic, and spreading, lacking any sharp, jagged, or drooping elements that might visually represent pain, struggle, or a sense of collapse. The composition feels open and balanced, without any sense of confinement, oppression, or isolation that could contribute to a feeling of sadness. While the abstract nature of the work allows for a wide range of subjective interpretations, there are no strong visual cues—such as a sense of weight, brokenness, or desolation—that would commonly trigger a response of sadness. Any trace of this emotion would be extremely tenuous and highly individual, perhaps a fleeting, almost imperceptible resonance with the inherent ambiguity of abstract forms or the subtle implication of a void within the orange mass as a lack or absence, but this is not a prominent or intended emotional register of the piece. The overall impression leans towards expressive vitality and chromatic presence rather than a sorrowful disposition."
orange-red-orange-1961.jpg,colorField,35.0,"The painting evokes a subtle, contemplative sense of sadness, rather than an overt feeling of sorrow or despair. This subdued melancholia primarily stems from the choice and treatment of the colors, particularly the large, muted orange-brown rectangle that dominates the lower half of the canvas. This deep, earthy tone carries a visual weight and solemnity, often associated with more subdued moods, the quiet passing of time, or the gentle decline seen in late autumn.

While the upper orange-red block and the golden border introduce warmth, they do not entirely offset the profound gravity of the lower color field. The soft, blurred edges of the color blocks, while creating an ethereal quality, also contribute to a sense of quietude and perhaps a subtle fading or dissolution, which can evoke a gentle longing or resignation. The overall composition, with its large, encompassing color fields and absence of dynamic movement or narrative elements, creates a profoundly introspective space. Within such a quiet, reflective setting, a sense of deep thoughtfulness often carries an undertone of subtle sadness or contemplative melancholy, rather than vibrant joy or energy. The stillness and visual weight invite a profound, internal emotional response that, for many, leans towards a quiet form of emotional depth that includes a touch of sorrow."
orange-over-violet-1968.jpg,colorField,37.5,"The painting evokes a subtle yet distinct sense of sadness, rooted primarily in its composition and the interplay of its color fields. The most poignant element contributing to sadness is the stark, horizontal black line piercing the upper-middle section. This line acts as a jarring disruption, a visual metaphor for"
pink-stripe-1960.jpg,colorField,1.0,"This painting primarily consists of bright, clean vertical stripes of blue and green, with a narrow pink stripe on the far left. The colors chosen are vibrant and clear, not muted, dark, or somber, which are qualities often associated with sadness or melancholy. The geometric and repetitive nature of the stripes creates a sense of order, precision, and perhaps a calming or even invigorating visual rhythm, rather than evoking any sense of despair, loss, or sorrow. There are no narrative elements, figures, or discernible subject matter that could hint at tragic themes or evoke empathy. The overall impression is one of visual cleanliness and optical play, suggesting neutrality, tranquility, or even a subtle energy. Any potential for sadness derived from this image would be extremely minimal and highly subjective, perhaps from a very abstract or detached feeling associated with the coolness of the blue and green, but this is a far stretch from a direct or palpable feeling of sadness. Therefore, the emotional resonance for sadness is virtually absent."
pink-flutter-1969.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The visual elements in this image offer very little, if any, basis for evoking sadness. The predominant color palette consists of warm, luminous yellows and oranges, often associated with vibrancy, energy, or warmth, which are generally antithetical to feelings of melancholy or sorrow. There is an absence of cool, muted tones such as deep blues, grays, or desaturated colors that are commonly linked to sadness or a somber mood. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the composition, characterized by vertical streaks and fluid patterns, lacks any discernible figurative elements, narrative context, or recognizable forms that could suggest themes of loss, despair, solitude, or any other subject typically evoking sadness. There are no heavy shadows, desolate landscapes, or forlorn figures. The light appears bright and diffuse, creating an expansive rather than a constricted or heavy atmosphere. While art can be deeply subjective, the objective formal qualities of this piece, particularly its color and abstract form, do not align with common visual representations or psychological associations of sadness, rendering its emotional impact in this regard extremely minimal."
peeping-wall-1960.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The painting, composed of distinct vertical stripes in a variety of bright and pastel colors (pink, red, light blue, orange, dark blue), evokes virtually no sense of sadness.

Firstly, the **color palette** is antithetical to feelings of melancholy. Vibrant reds and oranges convey energy and warmth, while the light blues and pinks suggest softness, cheerfulness, or calm. There are no muted, somber, or dark tones typically associated with sorrow, grief, or despair. Instead, the colors are clean, distinct, and visually stimulating, contributing to an overall impression of vibrancy and lightness.

Secondly, the **composition** is highly ordered and regular. The consistent width and vertical orientation of the stripes create a strong sense of rhythm, structure, and visual stability. There are no chaotic, distorted, or downward-pulling forms that might suggest distress, heaviness, or collapse, which are often compositional elements used to convey sadness. The clear, delineated nature of each stripe feels balanced and harmonious, rather than oppressive or turbulent.

Thirdly, as an **abstract work**, there is no discernible narrative or recognizable subject matter that could trigger sadness. Unlike figurative art that might depict scenes of loss or sorrow, this painting relies purely on its formal elements. These formal elements, in this specific instance, are purely chromatic and structural, and they do not lean towards any form of emotional distress or introspection associated with sadness.

Finally, the overall **aesthetic impression** is one of visual appeal, perhaps even decorative cheerfulness. The piece feels airy and direct, rather than heavy, contemplative, or burdened by emotional weight. The slight texture of the canvas, while present, does not add any element of rawness or agitation that might be interpreted as emotional turmoil.

A score of 0.5 is assigned because while the dominant visual cues actively counteract any feeling of sadness, acknowledging the extremely rare and highly subjective possibility that a viewer might find the rigid order or absence of organic forms to be sterile or emotionally detached to a degree that could, on a very subtle and intellectual level, evoke a fleeting, abstract sense of emptiness or lack of emotional complexity. However, this is a very tenuous link, and the overwhelming visual information points strongly towards the complete absence of sadness."
polar-co-ordinates-v-1980.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting displays no visual elements that would evoke or resonate with the emotion of sadness. The forms are robust and dynamic, characterized by their bold, interlocking shapes that suggest movement and organic growth rather than any state of dejection or sorrow. There are no drooping lines, heavy masses, or sharp, jarring angles that might convey discomfort or despair. The color palette, while featuring earthy tones of brown, maroon, and green, alongside muted teal and off-white, is not inherently melancholic or somber; instead, these colors contribute to a grounded, natural, and almost vibrant feel, especially when combined with the energetic curves and patterns. There is an absence of dark, overwhelming shadows or oppressive atmospheres commonly associated with sadness. The composition is balanced and appears to unfold or rotate, conveying a sense of vitality and continuous motion rather than stagnation or grief. The overall impression is one of structured energy and a natural, grounded aesthetic, entirely devoid of any visual cues that might trigger or reflect feelings of sadness."
ph-1033-1976.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting, characterized by its dominant fiery red forms against a light background, evokes very little to no sense of sadness. From an art expert's perspective, the visual elements present a strong contrast to those typically associated with this emotion.

Firstly, the most striking feature is the color palette, overwhelmingly dominated by a vivid, energetic red. Red is commonly linked with passion, energy, aggression, or warmth, but rarely with sadness. Colors traditionally used to convey sadness, such as muted blues, cool grays, or somber browns, are notably absent or minimally present. The overall vibrancy of the red creates a feeling of intensity and activity, rather than somberness or grief.

Secondly, the forms themselves are dynamic, spiky, and appear to reach upwards, almost like flames or energetic brushstrokes. This upward movement and irregular, jagged quality convey a sense of vitality, motion, and expressive force. Sadness, in contrast, is often represented through drooping forms, heavy lines, a sense of stillness, or downward gestures, none of which are prominent in this composition. There is an absence of visual weight or a sense of being weighed down, which could imply sorrow.

Thirdly, the abstract nature of the painting provides no direct narrative or recognizable figures that might depict a scene of loss, despair, or melancholy. There is no context given that would lead the viewer to interpret the visual information as a representation of sorrow or grief. The focus remains on the interplay of color and form, which leans towards a feeling of vibrancy and movement rather than introversion or sadness.

While art interpretation is subjective, the painting's inherent visual language—its bright, active colors and energetic, ascending forms—does not support an interpretation of sadness. Any perception of sadness would likely stem from a highly individual and external association rather than being an emotion directly elicited by the artwork's formal qualities."
pocahontas-1978.jpg,colorField,55.0,"The primary elements contributing to a sense of sadness in this painting are its subdued and desaturated color palette. The dominance of muted greys, dull blues, faded greens, and muted browns creates an inherently somber and melancholic atmosphere. There is a distinct absence of bright, vibrant, or warm colors that typically evoke feelings of joy or energy, which instead leaves the viewer with a sense of quietude that verges on melancholy. The vertical striped composition, while orderly, also contributes to a feeling of stillness and perhaps a lack of dynamism or spontaneity. This static presentation, combined with the subdued hues, can evoke a sense of quiet introspection or a wistful, almost melancholic, contemplation. The subtle, slightly textured appearance of the stripes adds a delicate layer of age or wear, further reinforcing a muted, perhaps even slightly faded, emotional landscape. It's a gentle, pervasive sadness, not an overwhelming despair, but a quiet, contemplative sorrow."
oe-280-komposition-in-rot-mit-wei-und-blau-1959.jpg,colorField,25.5,"The overall impression of this painting for evoking sadness is relatively low, yet not entirely absent. The dominant red hues, especially those fading into orange, convey a strong sense of warmth, passion, or even intense energy, which typically counteracts feelings of sadness.

However, there are subtle elements that contribute to a minor degree of solemnity or a quiet, internal melancholy. The large, dark, almost black section at the top of the canvas creates a heavy, brooding atmosphere. This deep void can evoke feelings of weight, absence, or a sense of foreboding, which are aspects that can contribute to sadness. The sharp, horizontal blue bar, positioned within this dark expanse, acts as a stark, almost cold, linear element. While blue can be associated with calmness, this particular shade and its sharp contrast against the darkness, along with its rigid form, could symbolize a barrier, a sense of isolation, or a distant, unreachable calm, which can foster a feeling of quiet contemplation that borders on melancholy.

The transition from the intense red to the dark top, with the blue line acting as a stark demarcation, might suggest a journey from fervent emotion to a more somber or weighty state. This subtle interplay of strong, passionate colors meeting a dark, quiet void, punctuated by a rigid blue line, can evoke a feeling of internal struggle or a heavy burden, which are often precursors or companions to sadness. It's a sense of gravity or solemnity, rather than overt despair or grief."
purple-color-field-with-two-green-lines.jpg,colorField,5.7,"The degree of sadness evoked by this painting is extremely low. The artwork is abstract and minimalist, which generally tends to distance it from explicit emotional narratives unless specific forms or colors are used to convey such feelings. The dominant color, a muted reddish-brown or plum, creates a somewhat subdued and contemplative atmosphere, but it is far from conveying deep sorrow or despair. It leans more towards an earthy, grounding presence rather than a somber one. There are no figures or discernible narratives that would typically elicit feelings of sadness. The composition features strong horizontal lines in vibrant green and a softer yellow, along with a textured reddish-brown band. These horizontal elements contribute to a sense of stability and stillness rather than collapse or distress, which are often associated with sadness. While the painting might evoke a quiet, introspective mood for some viewers due to its understated nature, this is distinct from an active feeling of sadness. The vibrant green line, in particular, introduces a dynamic and somewhat hopeful or lively element that counters any potential for profound melancholy. The overall impression is one of calm contemplation or a simplified landscape, not one of sorrow or grief. Therefore, any sense of sadness is extremely minimal, bordering on non-existent, and would likely be interpreted as a subtle form of quietness rather than genuine sorrow."
red-baron-1978.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork is characterized by its stark simplicity, featuring two large rectangular fields of warm, vibrant colors – an orange-red on the left and a more intense red on the right, separated by a thin vertical line. These colors (red and orange) are typically associated with energy, passion, warmth, or intensity, rather than melancholy or sadness. Sadness in art is often conveyed through cool tones (blues, grays), muted palettes, somber compositions, or figurative elements depicting sorrow. This painting, being purely abstract and consisting of bold, luminous hues, offers no visual cues for sadness. There are no downtrodden forms, no gloomy atmosphere, no desaturated tones, and no narrative elements that could be interpreted as mournful or indicative of despair. The subtle vertical textures across the surfaces do not carry any emotional weight related to sadness. Therefore, based purely on the visual information and common art associations, there is nothing within this image that evokes or represents sadness."
red-dog-1961.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The predominant use of dark, deep blue and black vertical stripes could, in some interpretations, evoke a sense of solemnity, seriousness, or even a hint of somberness due to their lack of vibrancy and the vast, repetitive expanse they create. This might be seen as austere or introspective, which can be a very subtle and indirect precursor to feelings of melancholy, especially in a quiet, abstract composition. However, the connection to profound sadness is extremely weak. There are no narrative elements, discernible figures, or expressions of distress. The composition is highly orderly and stable, lacking any visual cues of turmoil, dejection, or vulnerability that often accompany sadness. Furthermore, the prominent, bold red stripe introduces a strong, active visual counterpoint, and the thin green stripe adds another distinct, brighter element, both of which serve to break any potential overwhelming bleakness. These vibrant accents prevent the overall visual from settling into a truly sorrowful or desolate mood. Therefore, any perceived sadness is minimal, almost negligible, and highly subjective, primarily stemming from the dark color palette's potential for solemnity rather than any direct emotional impact."
raval-rojo-2004.jpg,colorField,7.5,"The painting primarily evokes emotions related to visual balance, color interaction, and formal composition rather than specific narratives of human emotion. However, a very low degree of sadness might be subtly inferred by some viewers due to the significant presence of dark colors, particularly black and dark gray/brown. Black is often symbolically associated with darkness, void, or mourning, which can evoke a somber or serious mood. The large, heavy blocks of these dark tones could be perceived as weighty or imposing, contributing to a faint sense of solemnity or introspection.

Despite this, any potential for strong sadness is heavily counteracted and mitigated by several factors. The painting incorporates vibrant and warm hues such as bright yellow, lively orange, and strong red. These colors are typically associated with energy, warmth, passion, and even joy, serving as powerful counterpoints to the darker tones. The overall composition is structured and stable, lacking any visual elements that suggest turmoil, fragility, loss, or despair. The brushstrokes, while visible, are not agitated or expressive of grief. There are no discernible figures or narrative elements that would typically convey a sense of sadness. Therefore, while the presence of dark colors might offer a very slight, indirect association with a muted or serious mood, the painting as a whole does not actively communicate or emphasize sadness. The balance of colors and the static, robust nature of the forms ensure that any feeling of sadness remains minimal and heavily subdued."
ressurection-1966.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork exhibits absolutely no visual cues that would evoke or align with the emotion of sadness. Its vibrant and highly saturated color palette, ranging from bright yellows and oranges to reds, magentas, purples, blues, and a light green center, is overwhelmingly joyful, energetic, and warm. These colors are universally associated with positivity, happiness, and vitality, standing in direct opposition to the subdued, cool, or muted tones typically linked to melancholy or sorrow. Furthermore, the composition, with its perfectly concentric circles formed by countless individual, yet harmoniously arranged, blocks, conveys a strong sense of order, balance, and completeness. There is no disarray, fragmentation, darkness, or narrative element that could be interpreted as somber or distressing. The overall impression is one of brightness, harmony, and visual stimulation, making the experience of viewing it entirely devoid of any trace of sadness."
rb-ps-2-15-1990.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The artwork presents an abstract composition of distinct vertical stripes in varying shades of grey and a rich dark purple. There are no narrative elements, human or animal figures, or contextual cues that typically evoke feelings of sadness, such as expressions of sorrow, scenes of loss, isolation, or bleak environments. The clean, straight lines and orderly, geometric arrangement contribute to a sense of structure and calm, rather than distress or disarray. While certain colors can carry emotional associations, the specific shades used here do not strongly convey sadness. The grey tones are neutral and clean, often associated with balance or formality. The dark purple, though deep, is a vibrant and rich hue rather than a muted or desaturated one often linked with melancholy or despair. It could be interpreted as introspective or regal, but not inherently sorrowful. The overall impression is one of minimalist design, aesthetic order, and perhaps quiet sophistication, completely devoid of the common visual triggers for sadness. Any minuscule potential for sadness might arise from a highly subjective interpretation of the stillness or the depth of the purple, but this is extremely weak and not a prominent emotional response facilitated by the composition as a whole."
red-with-white-triangle-1961.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The image elicits no discernible feeling of sadness. The dominant visual element is a vibrant, almost aggressive orange background, a color typically associated with energy, enthusiasm, warmth, or warning, rather than sorrow or melancholy. Sadness is more commonly evoked by cooler, muted, or desaturated tones such as blues, grays, or dark purples.

Furthermore, the central white shape is a stark, upward-pointing triangle, resembling an arrow or a rocket. This form strongly conveys a sense of ascent, direction, aspiration, or progress, which are concepts generally devoid of sadness and often associated with hope or dynamism. The thin, vertical line anchoring the triangle reinforces this sense of singular focus and upward trajectory, rather than conveying a feeling of being weighed down, defeated, or isolated in a sorrowful way.

The overall composition is minimalist and precise, lacking any elements that would suggest contemplation, loss, despair, or quiet sorrow. There are no drooping forms, heavy shadows, muted light, or ambiguous figures that could lend themselves to an interpretation of sadness. The image is clean, sharp, and bold, presenting a direct and almost symbolic visual statement that is entirely incongruent with the emotional experience of sadness."
red-white-and-brown.jpg,colorField,12.5,"The painting primarily uses warm and intense colors, dominated by various shades of red and a bright orange. These hues are typically associated with passion, energy, vibrancy, or intensity, rather than sorrow or melancholy. The large, luminous orange block in the center provides a sense of warmth and expansive energy that strongly counteracts any potential somberness. While the top reddish-brown rectangle introduces a heavier, more grounding tone, and the deep red background is immersive, they do not inherently evoke sadness. Rothko's abstract works aim for profound emotional experiences, which can encompass a wide spectrum of human feeling, including solemnity or a sense of the sublime that might be tinged with melancholy for some viewers. The soft, dissolving edges of the color fields could be interpreted as ephemeral, hinting at transience, which might subtly touch upon a wistful feeling. However, there are no direct visual cues such as dark, cool, or muted colors, downward forms, or explicit themes of loss or grief that would typically signify sadness. Any sense of sadness is highly indirect, secondary to the painting's powerful and immersive presence, and not the primary emotion conveyed by its visual language."
rose-rose-london-2012-olympic-games-poster-2012.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract composition of horizontal stripes in various pastel and soft hues, elicits virtually no sense of sadness. The color palette, which includes gentle shades of pink, peach, light green, pale blue, and soft yellow, is inherently light, warm, and harmonious. These colors are generally associated with calm, cheerfulness, or gentleness, distinctly lacking the cool, desaturated, or dark tones often used to convey melancholy, somberness, or despair. The uniform horizontal stripes create a visual rhythm that is orderly, stable, and visually soothing, contributing to a sense of calm rather than any emotional distress or sorrow. There are no disquieting forms, turbulent lines, or clashing elements within the composition that might disrupt this sense of peace or evoke feelings of sadness. As an abstract piece, it lacks any narrative or figurative elements that could convey themes of loss, grief, or hardship. The overall aesthetic is one of visual balance and subtle interplay of color, promoting a serene or contemplative mood, far removed from any inclination towards sadness."
royal-canoe-1977.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, composed entirely of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors, presents a visual experience that is highly abstract and devoid of any overt narrative or representational elements typically associated with evoking specific human emotions like sadness. The colors used are generally bright and varied, especially on the right side of the canvas where a multitude of thin lines in shades of red, blue, white, pink, and yellow create a vibrant, almost cheerful, mosaic. On the left, wider stripes of burgundy, light brown, and lavender are present. While these colors might be considered more subdued than the brighter ones on the right, they do not inherently carry a mournful or melancholic quality. There are no dark, heavy, or desaturated tones that are often used to convey sorrow. Furthermore, the rigid, orderly, and repetitive nature of the stripes lends itself more to a sense of structure, pattern, or even a decorative aesthetic rather than emotional depth. The predictability and geometric precision of the composition offer no visual cues of turmoil, despair, or loss that would trigger a feeling of sadness. Therefore, the emotional impact is largely neutral in terms of sadness, verging on slightly uplifting or stimulating due to the color variety, thus scoring extremely low on the sadness scale."
rose-sun-box-nr-2-1969.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting, characterized by a large pink rectangle within a brown border, elicits virtually no sense of sadness. The dominant pink hue, while not overtly cheerful, lacks the cool, muted, or desaturated tones typically associated with melancholy or sorrow. There are no dark shadows, heavy lines, or somber contrasts that might evoke feelings of despair or grief. The composition is simple and geometric, devoid of any narrative elements, human figures, or expressions that could convey a sense of loss, isolation, or longing. The texture within the pink rectangle, though varied, does not suggest turmoil or distress; rather, it appears as a subtle, almost shimmering surface. Overall, the painting's visual language is clean, contemplative, and aesthetically balanced, offering no discernible cues that would lead one to interpret it as a sad piece of art. Any perceived sadness would be purely coincidental or highly idiosyncratic, as the objective visual elements do not support such an emotional response."
red.jpg,colorField,74.5,"The painting evokes a deep and profound sense of sadness through its contemplative use of color and form. The dominant central block of deep, rich red possesses a weighty solemnity, resonating with fundamental human experiences of loss or sacrifice, rather than vibrant energy. This particular shade of red contributes to a feeling of profound gravity, almost like a heavy, internal ache. The top, paler yellowish-cream segment appears muted and somewhat ethereal, suggesting a fading of light or a quiet resignation, contributing to a melancholic pallor. The soft, blurred edges of all the color fields create a sense of vulnerability, as if the colors themselves are dissolving or weeping, fostering a gentle, pervasive melancholia. The heavy, rectangular forms appear static and imposing, imbuing the composition with a significant emotional burden. There is a palpable sense of gravity and stillness that invites introspection, naturally leading to a confrontation with profound, sometimes sorrowful emotions. The dark, indistinct borders enveloping the color blocks further enhance a feeling of being contained within a deep, weighted emotional space, contributing to an overall atmosphere of solemnity and a quiet, profound sadness. The absence of specific imagery means the emotion is directly conveyed through the chromatic interaction and form, making the sadness feel intrinsic and deeply felt, rather than a fleeting reaction."
sabra-iii-1967.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The visual language of this abstract geometric composition provides very few, if any, cues that directly evoke or suggest sadness. The primary elements are clean, radiating lines and bold, distinct color blocks. The color palette, while diverse, features a significant presence of vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows, particularly in the larger left section, which are typically associated with energy, warmth, and vitality, rather than somber or melancholic states. Even the cooler tones (blue, grey, black) present in the smaller right section are integrated within a structured, fanned arrangement and do not create an overwhelming sense of darkness, desaturation, or heaviness often linked to sadness.

The forms themselves are precise, geometric, and dynamic, radiating outwards like a fan or sunburst. This sense of expansion and order contrasts sharply with feelings of constriction, collapse, or emotional distress that might manifest as visual 'drooping' or fragmentation in art. The overall composition is balanced and clean, with a bright, open background, lacking any visual weight, imbalance, or oppressive elements that could induce a feeling of sadness. There are no distressed textures, chaotic arrangements, or muted tones that would typically contribute to a melancholic mood. Therefore, any perceived sadness would be minimal, perhaps an extremely subtle undertone derived from the few darker or cooler hues, but far outweighed by the general vibrancy and structured energy of the piece."
segwehce-1965.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The visual language of this painting offers virtually no cues that would evoke a sense of sadness. The colors—vibrant green, strong blue, bold red, rich purple, and bright yellow—are distinct, clean, and saturated. They lack the muted, desaturated, or dark tones often associated with melancholy, sorrow, or despair. There's no sense of gloom or heaviness. Furthermore, the composition, with its perfectly horizontal, evenly spaced stripes, conveys an extreme sense of order, balance, and clarity. There is no disruption, no chaotic element, no sagging line, no somber shadow, and no narrative context (figurative or implied) that might suggest loss, regret, or any form of distress. The painting is entirely devoid of visual weight or emotional tension that would lead one towards a feeling of sadness. Its overall impression is one of crispness, visual harmony, and perhaps even a certain cheerful simplicity or neutrality, making any connection to sadness negligible to non-existent."
sem-titulo-1988.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The intense, saturated field of warm red-orange color dominating this canvas does not, in conventional artistic and psychological associations, evoke feelings of sadness. Sadness is typically associated with cooler tones like blues and grays, or with muted, desaturated palettes that convey a sense of melancholy, introspection, or loss. The vibrant and encompassing nature of this color, instead, tends to suggest energy, passion, warmth, or even a meditative intensity, rather than sorrow or despair. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the painting provides no narrative, figures, or discernible objects that might traditionally convey a story or situation prone to eliciting sadness. The very faint, almost etched lines within the color field are subtle and geometric, lacking any organic or distressed qualities that could be interpreted as symbolic of emotional pain or brokenness. The overall visual experience is one of pure, powerful color presence, which stands in stark contrast to the quiet, subdued, or desolate sensations typically linked with sadness."
silvio-set-one-1963.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork evokes no discernible sense of sadness. The dominant characteristics of the painting, such as the vibrant and energetic application of paint, the bright and varied color palette (including vivid blues, yellows, reds, and touches of green and black), and the dynamic, splattered composition, actively contradict any feelings of sorrow or melancholy. The forms are fluid and gestural, suggesting movement and spontaneity rather than somberness or despair. There are no heavy forms, drooping lines, or muted tones that typically connote sadness. The overall impression is one of vivacity and active expression, entirely devoid of elements that would elicit or support a feeling of sadness."
saraband-1959.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The painting evokes a notable degree of sadness primarily through its color palette and visual flow. The dominant hues are deep, muted browns, purples, greens, and somber oranges, which inherently carry a solemn and melancholic weight, lacking the vibrancy and brightness typically associated with joy or upliftment. These colors blend into one another, creating an impression of overlapping shadows and indistinct forms that can feel heavy and introspective.

Furthermore, the prominent vertical strokes, especially as they descend and appear to pool or condense at the bottom of the canvas, suggest a visual metaphor for weeping or dripping. This downward motion and perceived accumulation contribute to a sense of being weighed down or experiencing a gentle, persistent sorrow. The overall softness and lack of sharp, energetic forms further amplify this contemplative and somewhat somber mood, leaning towards a quiet melancholy rather than an acute or aggressive despair. It feels like a visual expression of a subdued, lingering sadness."
samba-2005.jpg,colorField,88.0,"The painting evokes a profound and pervasive sense of sadness through its stark minimalist composition and color palette. The dominant, almost absolute black background immediately creates a somber, heavy, and melancholic atmosphere. Black is inherently associated with darkness, emptiness, grief, and despair, setting a deeply sorrowful tone that engulfs the entire visual field. This vast, dark expanse can be interpreted as a void or an overwhelming burden, contributing significantly to feelings of desolation and profound sadness.

Contrasting sharply with the black are the two irregular, vertical red forms. Red, in this context, does not suggest warmth or passion, but rather an intense, raw, and almost visceral emotional state. These shapes can be profoundly evocative of pain, wounds, or bleeding, hinting at suffering that is central to the experience of sadness. The left shape, being longer and more fluid, could be perceived as a cascading tear, a trail of raw emotion, or even a weeping figure. The right shape, though shorter and more contained, shares the same isolation and vulnerability.

The isolation of these two distinct red forms within the vast, dark emptiness powerfully conveys feelings of loneliness and separation, which are fundamental components of sadness. They appear solitary, surrounded by an oppressive void, amplifying the sense of abandonment or profound sorrow. The raw, somewhat unrefined texture of the paint, particularly visible in the red strokes, adds to a feeling of unfiltered, perhaps even aching, emotional expression. There are no elements of relief, joy, or hope in the composition to mitigate this overwhelming sense of sorrow. The overall impression is one of a deep, almost primal sadness, possibly stemming from loss, suffering, or a profound sense of isolation."
robinson-s-wrap-1974.jpg,colorField,40.5,"The painting evokes a moderate sense of sadness, leaning towards melancholy and introspection rather than overt grief or despair. This emotional response is primarily driven by the central, heavy mass of deep red and burgundy. This rich, intense hue can be interpreted as representing profound emotional states, including pain, sorrow, or a deeply felt inner turmoil. The way the red bleeds and softens at its edges, dissolving into lighter magenta tones, suggests a pervasive and perhaps uncontained emotional state, akin to a wound that is quietly seeping or a sorrow that gradually permeates. The sheer visual weight and density of this form contribute to a feeling of emotional burden or heaviness.

Furthermore, the muted greenish-grey layer above the red adds to a somber atmosphere, suggesting a cloudy thought or a quiet lament. While the pale yellow background offers space and lightness, it paradoxically emphasizes the intensity and emotional concentration of the central abstract forms, making their somber qualities more prominent. The faint white stroke near the bottom is subtle and doesn't significantly detract from the underlying contemplative sadness but rather provides a slight visual anchor. The overall effect is one of quiet contemplation on a weighty emotional experience, a deep-seated sadness that is present but not outwardly expressed with anguish."
sour-ball-beat-1964.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The painting, composed of a series of vertical stripes in various bright and strong colors, evokes very little to no sense of sadness. The dominant palette includes vibrant reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and a clear blue, along with rich browns and a soft pink. These hues are generally associated with energy, warmth, and vitality, strongly counteracting any potential for melancholy. There are no cool, muted, or desaturated tones (such as deep greys, somber blues, or dull purples) that are traditionally linked with sorrow, introspection, or loss. The repetitive, orderly arrangement of the stripes creates a sense of rhythm and pattern that is more neutral or even stimulating, rather than evoking feelings of despair or emotional heaviness. There is no discernible narrative, figural representation, or textural quality that would suggest grief, longing, or any form of emotional suffering. The overall visual impression is one of directness and vibrancy, which fundamentally opposes the emotional landscape of sadness. Any perceived sadness would be highly idiosyncratic and not inherent to the visual properties of the artwork."
smithsonian-resident-associates-program-1985-20th-anniversary-poster-1985.jpg,colorField,18.0,"The dominant visual element contributing even a slight hint of sadness is the extensive use of flat, deep black. In some contexts, black can symbolize absence, emptiness, or a void, which might be abstractly linked to feelings of loss or somberness. However, the black in this composition is presented as an unblemished, expansive field, lending a sense of starkness, formality, or even neutrality, rather than overt emotional depth or melancholy.

Counteracting any potential for sadness are the vibrant, orderly vertical stripes. Their crisp lines, bright colors (red, yellow, light blue, green, white), and precise, repetitive pattern evoke a sense of order, design, and visual rhythm. These elements tend to feel more analytical, systematic, or even energetic due to the color variety and contrast, pulling the emotional register away from sadness. There is no narrative, blurred edges, drooping forms, or evocative light/shadow play that typically characterize works aiming to convey profound sadness. The overall impression is one of clean abstraction and controlled precision, which largely bypasses deeply melancholic sentiments. Therefore, any perceived sadness is minimal and highly abstract, derived primarily from the intellectual association of black with emptiness rather than a direct emotional resonance."
sevastipol-2003.jpg,colorField,42.5,"The painting evokes a notable, though not overwhelming, sense of sadness primarily through its color palette and the weight of its forms. The most significant contributor to this feeling is the large, prominent black rectangular column. Black is frequently associated with mourning, void, absence, and despair, and its significant presence here creates a heavy, somber anchor in the composition. Directly adjacent, the deep, somewhat muted blue rectangle further enhances this somber mood, as dark blues often convey introspection, melancholy, or quiet solemnity. Additionally, the narrow, desaturated grey-beige strip on the far right contributes to a feeling of quietude and a lack of vibrancy, subtly leaning towards a melancholic or subdued emotional state. The stark, rigid verticality of the composition, devoid of any flowing"
summer-palace-1975.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This artwork evokes absolutely no sense of sadness. The dominant color scheme, featuring soft pinks and vibrant yellow accents, is light, airy, and inherently cheerful or peaceful rather than melancholic or somber. Pink often conveys warmth, gentleness, or innocence, while the yellow streaks suggest energy, light, and positivity, akin to sunlight or bursts of joy. There are no dark tones, heavy textures, or brooding compositions that typically correlate with feelings of sorrow or distress. The abstract forms are fluid and dynamic, lacking any figurative elements or narratives that might suggest loss, pain, or lament. Furthermore, the visible title, ""Summer Peace,"" explicitly reinforces a feeling of tranquility and contentment, directly contradicting any notion of sadness. The overall impression is one of lightness, calm, and perhaps gentle optimism, making any interpretation of sadness entirely unfounded."
starry-night-and-the-astronauts-1972.jpg,colorField,65.0,"The painting predominantly features various shades of blue, a color frequently associated with melancholy, introspection, and a somber mood. The deep, saturated blues create a heavy, almost pervasive atmosphere that can evoke feelings of sadness. The fragmented, block-like brushstrokes, separated by white spaces, contribute to a sense of brokenness, disjointedness, or incompleteness, which can align with emotional distress or sorrow. This visual texture prevents a sense of fluidity or comfort, instead presenting a somewhat stark and disconnected field. The sheer density of these blue elements, filling almost the entire canvas, can feel overwhelming or suffocating, contributing to a sense of quiet desperation or a heavy heart. The small burst of warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) in the upper right, while visually striking, is isolated and small against the vast blue expanse. This contrast can highlight the prevailing cool, melancholic tone, making the warmth appear distant, fleeting, or unreachable, thereby emphasizing a sense of loss or longing rather than offering solace. The overall impression leans towards a contemplative, somber mood, suggesting a significant presence of sadness, though not necessarily despair."
study-ii-1981.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting is an abstract composition of colored rectangles, primarily exploring formal elements like color, shape, and arrangement rather than conveying a specific emotional narrative. There are no figures, scenes, or symbolic elements traditionally associated with sadness, such as weeping, loss, or desolate landscapes. While certain colors, like the deep blue and muted olive green, can sometimes be associated with somberness or melancholy, their presence here is balanced and often contrasted by more vibrant hues like the bold yellow and the deep red. The overall color palette is diverse, preventing any single mournful tone from dominating. The clean, straight lines and structured rectangular forms also contribute to a sense of order and stability, which typically does not align with feelings of sorrow or distress. The raw, torn edges of the paper might suggest a sense of worn authenticity or the passage of time, but this is more about materiality and process than an direct evocation of sadness. The piece lacks any visual cues that would strongly provoke or embody feelings of grief, despair, or profound unhappiness. Any perceived sadness would be extremely subtle, stemming perhaps from a subjective interpretation of the darker tones rather than an inherent quality of the artwork itself, which largely remains emotionally neutral concerning this specific feeling."
seward-park-1958.jpg,colorField,70.0,"The painting evokes a palpable sense of sadness primarily through its stark color palette and heavy, unyielding composition. The dominant use of deep, matte black, particularly in the large central block and the prominent horizontal stripes, immediately conveys a feeling of weight, emptiness, and darkness. Black is culturally and psychologically associated with mourning, loss, and the absence of light, strongly contributing to a somber and melancholic atmosphere. This black feels absorbing and dense, suggesting an emotional void or an oppressive burden.

The accompanying yellow is not bright, vibrant, or cheerful; instead, it is a muted, almost desaturated, jaundiced, or mustardy tone. This dull yellow, rather than providing light or warmth, contributes to the painting's overall somberness, lacking the vivacity that would uplift the mood. It feels drained or tired, adding to the sense of quiet despair. The deep, dark green at the very bottom further anchors the painting in a heavy, earthy, and subdued realm, reinforcing the muted and serious tone.

The composition, with its broad, horizontal bands and the stark, block-like central black area, feels weighty and static. There is an absence of dynamic movement or lightheartedness. The visual elements seem to press down, creating a sense of profound stillness that can be interpreted as a quiet resignation, deep contemplation, or a heavy emotional state, all of which align with sadness. The rough, textured brushstrokes also add to a raw, unpolished emotional quality, suggesting a fundamental rawness of feeling that might be painful or sorrowful. The overall impression is one of solemnity, profound quietness, and a marked lack of joy or dynamism, all contributing to a strong and persistent feeling of underlying sadness."
square-motif-in-white-and-indian-red-1960.jpg,colorField,42.0,"The emotion of sadness is evoked in this abstract composition primarily through the stark formal elements and their interplay, rather than through overt narrative or symbolic representation. The most significant contributor to a sense of sadness is the vast, uninterrupted expanse of white in the lower half of the painting. This white area, framed and delineated by sharp black lines, evokes a profound sense of emptiness, absence, or a void. Absence is a common catalyst for sadness, suggesting something missing or lost.

The black lines themselves contribute to this feeling. Black is often associated with mourning, sorrow, and finality. The horizontal black lines sharply cut across the canvas, creating a definitive division between the vibrant red above and the stark white below. This act of separation, of being 'cut off,' can be interpreted as a rupture or a loss, which can lead to feelings of sadness. The asymmetry and sharp angles of the intersecting black lines (one straight horizontal, another slightly angled, and a vertical line forming a corner in the white space) introduce a sense of disquiet or a fractured state, further contributing to a melancholic or unsettling mood. The vertical black line extending downwards along the left edge of the white area can feel restrictive or like a barrier, enclosing the emptiness.

While the red at the top is vibrant and intense, not typically a color associated with sadness"
tom-s-furnace-1961.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting, composed of distinct vertical stripes in shades of deep blue, teal, and bright orange/yellow, evokes very little, if any, sense of sadness. The colors are vibrant and saturated; the blues and teals, while cool, are rich and assertive rather than muted or somber. The central block of warm orange and yellow hues further contributes to a feeling of energy and brightness, counteracting any potential coolness from the blue sections. The highly organized and rhythmic composition, with its precise, uniform stripes, conveys order and stability rather than chaos or distress, which might be associated with melancholic feelings. There are no drooping lines, somber tones, or unsettling visual elements that typically contribute to a feeling of sadness. The overall impression is one of visual harmony, optical vibration, and a certain boldness, all of which are antithetical to a sense of melancholy or sorrow. The painting is abstract and does not present any narrative or figurative elements that could be interpreted as sad. Any minimal score might only come from an extremely subjective and rare association of cool colors with introspection, but even then, the vibrancy here strongly overrides such a connection to sadness."
the-howl-of-terror-1967.jpg,colorField,78.5,"The dominant deep indigo-purple that fills the vast majority of the canvas creates an immediate sense of profound solemnity and introspection, which are often precursors or companions to sadness. This expansive, dark field feels immense and heavy, like a deep, silent void or an overwhelming, somber sky, evoking a feeling of quiet solitude or a pervasive sense of emptiness that can be deeply melancholic. The horizontal lines at the bottom, particularly the delicate, almost ephemeral white and pale grey stripes, stand in stark contrast to the deep darkness above. These lines can be interpreted as distant, perhaps unreachable horizons or faint remnants, contributing to a feeling of wistful longing, separation, or a quiet, drawn-out sorrow. Their subdued and faded appearance, like distant memories or fading hopes, further reinforces a sense of quiet sadness rather than vibrant optimism. The overall stillness and balanced, unchanging composition of the painting contribute to a sense of quiet contemplation and a deep, internal emotional state, aligning with a profound, unexpressed sadness that resides within. There are no elements of joy or overt energy, only a profound sense of quietude that allows for a contemplative and melancholic emotional response."
the-station-of-the-cross-first-station-1958.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The painting evokes a palpable sense of sadness primarily through its stark color palette and the organic, almost weeping quality of its dominant dark form. The large, uneven vertical mass of dark, ink-like pigment on the right side feels heavy and imposing against the expansive, pale, almost empty background. The edges of this dark form are not crisp but appear smudged, diluted, and as if bleeding or dissolving downwards, strongly reminiscent of tears or a profound, uncontrolled outpouring of sorrow. This fluidity suggests a loss of containment, a surrender to a deep emotional state. The contrast between the heavy, dark presence and the vast, lighter space around it creates a sense of isolation or a weighty burden within an otherwise desolate landscape. The faint, subtle yellowish tints in the background contribute to a somber, perhaps aged or faded, atmosphere, further enhancing a melancholic mood rather than providing warmth or vibrancy. The overall effect is one of profound internal gravity, a visual representation of a lingering sorrow or a scar etched into being."
twined-columns-ii-1960.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting evokes very little to no sadness. The palette consists of light, translucent, and blended colors (blues, greens, yellows, reds, and purples) that are largely vibrant and ethereal, rather than dark, muted, or heavy hues often associated with melancholy or sorrow. The soft, diffuse edges and layered washes create a sense of lightness and fluidity, which contributes to a serene or contemplative atmosphere, markedly different from the oppressive or rigid forms that might suggest despair. There are no visual elements such as downward-sloping lines, somber figures, or chaotic compositions that typically convey a sense of grief, loss, or distress. Instead, the luminosity and gentle interplay of colors lend themselves more to feelings of calm, contemplation, or even a quiet optimism, thus placing it far from the realm of sadness."
unknown-title-2.jpg!PinterestLarge.jpg,colorField,0.1,"The painting, an abstract composition of vertical stripes in vibrant, saturated colors such as bright red, various greens, deep blue, and clear yellow, evokes no discernible feeling of sadness. The hues used are overwhelmingly bold and lively, typically associated with energy, optimism, and cheerfulness rather than sorrow or melancholy. There are no muted tones, dark shades, or desaturated colors that might suggest somberness, introspection, or despair. Furthermore, the orderly, clear-cut vertical lines create a sense of structure and presence rather than chaos or void. The overall impression is one of vibrancy, clarity, and perhaps even a celebration of color itself, which directly counteracts any potential for sadness. There is nothing in the palette, composition, or abstract nature of the work that cues or reflects a state of emotional downturn or sorrow."
thira-1980.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The painting is an abstract composition primarily featuring geometric blocks and stripes of color. There are no narrative elements, human figures, or discernible scenes that typically evoke sadness. The overall impression is one of structured design and color interplay rather than emotional expression. The palette includes vibrant reds and greens, which are generally not associated with sorrow. However, there are also elements of dark navy blue and a muted olive-khaki green, particularly in the rightmost panel. Darker blues can, in some contexts, be associated with melancholy or ""the blues."" When these darker, more subdued tones are placed alongside the brighter, more active reds, a very subtle, perhaps unintentional, contrast could be perceived by some as lending a slight degree of seriousness or subdued introspection. This is a very mild interpretation, as the dominant feeling conveyed by the painting is one of visual harmony, balance, and formal exploration. Therefore, any sense of sadness is extremely faint and highly subjective, registering as almost negligible."
train-landscape-1953.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, composed of three horizontal stripes in shades of green and yellow, evokes no discernible sense of sadness. The top stripe is a bright, vibrant lime green, the middle a rich, verdant green, and the bottom a cheerful, sunny yellow. These colors are inherently associated with nature, growth, freshness, energy, and optimism. Bright and lively hues like these typically uplift the spirit or create a sense of harmony and vitality, directly contrasting with emotions of sorrow or melancholy. There are no dark, muted, cool, or desaturated tones that are commonly used to convey sadness, nor are there any heavy, somber textures or irregular, unsettling forms. The composition is simple, stable, and orderly, which tends to promote a sense of calm and balance rather than emotional distress or wistfulness. The complete absence of narrative elements or figures means there is no subject matter to relate to in a way that might trigger empathetic feelings of sadness. The overall impression is one of brightness, natural vibrancy, and clarity, providing no visual cues or emotional triggers that would lead to a feeling of sadness."
unknown-title.jpg,colorField,0.1,"This painting exhibits virtually no elements that would typically evoke or represent sadness. The predominant color palette is vibrant and rich, dominated by warm and energetic hues like bright yellows, reds, and oranges, juxtaposed with lively greens, blues, and purples. These colors are generally associated with joy, energy, and liveliness, rather than melancholy or sorrow. There is an absence of muted tones, deep grays, or desaturated blues that often accompany feelings of sadness or introspection. The composition, with its rhythmic grid of colorful, hand-painted shapes and the dynamic vertical lines, suggests movement and vibrancy rather than stillness or somberness. There are no downward-sloping forms, heavy masses, or chaotic elements that might symbolize distress or burden. The overall impression is one of visual excitement and cheerful abstraction, lacking any narrative or figurative elements that could convey loss, grief, or solitude. The painting's aesthetic character is unequivocally far from any interpretation of sadness."
untilted-1959.jpg,colorField,5.2,"The image is an abstract composition of several large, somewhat irregular color blobs on a light background. There are no discernible figures, scenes, or narrative elements that typically evoke feelings of sadness, loss, or melancholy. The colors themselves, while including some darker tones like deep purple and a muted maroon, are balanced by vibrant and active blues, and a strong, warm red/orange. This combination prevents the overall palette from leaning towards somberness or despair. The shapes are organic and somewhat amorphous, lacking any sharp edges or heavy forms that might convey burden or sorrow. The arrangement feels somewhat scattered yet balanced, not suggesting isolation or despondency. Without any contextual cues or symbolic representations typically associated with sadness, the visual elements of this abstract piece offer very little, if anything, to elicit or amplify feelings of sadness in the viewer. The slight presence of dark purples might be interpreted as contemplative, but not inherently sad, especially given the contrasting brighter hues."
two-edges-1948.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The painting evokes a distinct, albeit subdued, sense of sadness primarily through its monochromatic palette and compositional structure. The dominant colors are muted, earthy browns and tans, which lack vibrancy and contribute to a somber, melancholic atmosphere. There's a notable absence of bright, uplifting hues, creating an overall impression that leans towards quiet contemplation and introspection, often associated with sorrow.

The composition, with its strong vertical divisions, adds to this feeling. The broad, dark brown band on the far left feels heavy and oppressive, almost like a looming shadow or a weighty barrier. This creates a sense of solemnity and a lack of openness. The central section, while lighter, maintains the muted tone and features subtle, almost veil-like vertical striations, suggesting a hiddenness or a sense of things being obscured, which can relate to feelings of loss or an internalized sorrow.

The single, stark white vertical line on the far right, while being the brightest element, does not significantly alleviate the overall somber mood. Instead, its thinness and isolation against the expansive muted background can paradoxically heighten the feeling of quiet desolation or a distant, almost unreachable hope. It emphasizes the prevailing subdued state rather than offering a strong counterpoint of joy or light. The overall stillness and lack of dynamic movement in the abstract forms contribute to a sense of quietude that can be interpreted as reflective of a deep, internalized melancholy rather than an active or outward expression of grief. It suggests a solemn and perhaps weary emotional landscape."
unknown-title-15.jpg,colorField,1.0,"This abstract painting evokes an extremely minimal, almost negligible, sense of sadness. The dominant colors are a calm, slightly muted blue and various shades of green, interspersed with vibrant reds, oranges, yellows, and soft lilacs. While blue can sometimes be associated with melancholy, the specific shade used here is more serene or airy than somber or heavy. The greens are fresh and lively, and the warm reds, oranges, and yellows inject energy and brightness into the composition, actively counteracting any potential for a melancholic interpretation.

The strict verticality and orderly arrangement of the stripes contribute to a feeling of stability, balance, and rhythm, rather than distress or sorrow. There are no drooping lines, chaotic elements, or heavy, dark forms that are typically used in art to convey sadness or despair. The overall impression is one of harmonious calm, visual meditation, or even a quiet optimism, which stands in stark opposition to the emotion of sadness. The painting lacks the somber tones, desaturated palette, or narrative cues often found in works that aim to evoke sorrow or grief. Any perceived sadness would be an extremely personal and tangential interpretation, far from the primary emotional response intended or conveyed by the visual elements."
untitled-156-1971.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The visual elements in this image offer virtually no discernible cues that would evoke sadness. The color palette, composed of soft, muted pastels and earthy tones—including light greens, pinks, lavenders, browns, and golds—tends to create a sense of calm, tranquility, and natural harmony rather than sorrow or melancholy. These colors are gentle and pleasing, lacking the somberness of deep blues, greys, or heavy purples often associated with sadness, nor do they possess the jarring intensity that could suggest distress.

Furthermore, the composition of perfectly horizontal, parallel stripes conveys an overwhelming sense of order, stability, and peacefulness. There is no visual tension, jaggedness, downward motion, or chaotic elements that might typically suggest emotional turmoil or despair. The consistent, rhythmic arrangement is soothing and predictable, contributing to a feeling of balance and serenity rather than discomfort or loss.

There are no narrative elements, figures, or objects that could convey a story of sadness. The abstraction itself is clean and harmonious. While one might interpret the subdued nature of the colors as a lack of vibrancy, which could abstractly hint at a 'subdued' emotional state, this is a tenuous connection at best and is far more readily interpreted as calm or quietude. The overall impression is one of gentle calm and understated beauty, rather than any profound or even mild sense of sorrow."
untitled-1957.jpg,colorField,5.2,"The painting, an abstract expressionist work, features a vibrant and dynamic interplay of bright yellow, strong blue, and hints of red against a predominantly white background. The application of paint involves energetic splatters, drips, and broad, spontaneous brushstrokes. There are no discernible figures, narratives, or forms that typically convey sadness. The colors used are generally perceived as lively and energetic rather than somber or melancholic; yellow often connotes joy or warmth, and while blue can sometimes be associated with sadness, in this context, it appears as an active, bold color, contributing to the overall energetic feel. The chaotic and unrestrained movement of the paint, with its active drips and splashes, suggests spontaneity and vitality rather than a feeling of despondency, stillness, or heavy emotion. There are no dark, muted, or heavy tones that might evoke a sense of grief or sorrow, nor are there compositions that feel weighed down or withdrawn. Any very low score above zero acknowledges the subjective nature of emotional response and the potential for a fleeting, minor, or personal interpretation of a single brushstroke or color nuance as slightly less exuberant, but objectively, the overwhelming visual evidence points away from sadness."
untitled-1952.jpg,colorField,75.0,"The painting evokes a profound sense of sadness primarily through its dominant color palette and the application of paint. The pervasive use of deep, muted reds, akin to dried blood or rich, somber earth tones, immediately conveys a weighty and serious emotional landscape, far removed from joy or lightness. This is powerfully contrasted and underscored by the stark, expansive areas of black, which intrinsically carry connotations of emptiness, loss, and mourning.

The most striking element contributing to sadness is the technique of paint application. The thick, impasto brushstrokes are predominantly vertical, creating a strong visual impression of dripping, weeping, or bleeding downwards. This visceral texture and directionality serve as a potent metaphor for emotional outpouring—like tears streaming or internal sorrow slowly manifesting. The heavy, almost viscous quality of the paint enhances this feeling of a burdened, sorrowful release.

Furthermore, the vertical black lines, appearing almost as deep fissures or dark, unyielding columns amidst the flowing red, introduce a sense of rupture, desolation, or an unbridgeable void. These elements combine to create a composition that feels heavy, somber, and imbued with a pervasive sense of melancholy, quiet suffering, and the solemn weight of enduring sorrow. The abstract nature means it doesn't depict a specific sad event, but rather communicates the *feeling* of sadness through its raw, material presence."

untitled-1959.jpg,colorField,3.0,"The visual characteristics of this painting offer very little to evoke a sense of sadness. The dominant feature is the expansive, vibrant field of orange that occupies the central and largest portion of the canvas. Orange is a color typically associated with energy, warmth, enthusiasm, and joy, qualities that directly counteract feelings of sorrow or melancholy. Its bright, almost radiant quality creates an impression of liveliness and boldness.

While the flanking areas of muted grey-blue might, in isolation, suggest a degree of coolness, neutrality, or even a subtle hint of somberness (as blue can sometimes be linked to introspection or melancholy), their overall tone is more dusty and desaturated rather than deeply melancholic or despairing. Crucially, these grey-blue areas are visually subordinate to the overwhelming presence and luminosity of the orange. The dynamic, somewhat rough texture and the irregular, almost agitated edges where the orange meets the grey-blue suggest movement and a raw, immediate quality, rather than stillness, resignation, or the heavy weight often associated with sadness. There are no drooping forms, dark, heavy shadows, or narrative elements to imply loss, grief, or withdrawal. The overall emotional landscape presented by the artwork is one of striking contrast and energetic presence, leaving very little room for an interpretation of sadness."
untitled-1959-1.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The primary emotional impact of this painting strongly diverges from sadness. The dominant feature is the vibrant, almost fiery orange color that fills the central area of the canvas. Orange is intrinsically associated with energy, enthusiasm, warmth, joy, and vitality, directly counteracting any sense of sorrow or melancholy. This intense hue creates an immediate feeling of dynamism and brightness.

While the surrounding deep blue background can sometimes be linked to feelings of sadness or introspection (""feeling blue""), in this context, its primary function appears to be providing a bold, high-contrast frame for the exuberant orange. The blue itself is rich and profound, suggesting depth or vastness (like a night sky or deep ocean) rather than a muted or somber hue that would induce gloom. The white speckles scattered across the surface further enhance a sense of light or cosmic energy, adding to the overall vibrancy.

There are no visual cues typically associated with sadness, such as downtrodden figures, desolate landscapes, muted or muddy color palettes, or imagery of loss and despair. The abstract and expressive nature of the brushstrokes, particularly in the blue border, suggests a raw energy rather than a somber mood. The overall composition feels assertive and energetic. Any potential for sadness is exceptionally minimal and would be a highly subjective interpretation, perhaps only a faint, fleeting association some might draw from the deepness of the blue, which is powerfully overshadowed by the overwhelming, positive energy of the orange."
tdb.jpg,colorField,48.0,"The painting evokes a discernible, yet subtle, sense of sadness primarily through its dominant color palette and minimalist composition. The vast expanse of deep, earthy brown occupying the majority of the canvas creates an immediate feeling of somberness and weight. This muted hue, devoid of vibrancy, contributes to an overall quietude that can lean towards a sense of loneliness or contemplation, far from any joyous expression.

The thin, delicate light blue horizontal line cutting across this immense brown field introduces a poignant fragility. Its subtle presence against the overwhelming brown suggests a solitary thread, a distant horizon, or a faint, almost vanishing hope amidst a vast, perhaps overwhelming, emptiness. This vulnerability and isolation of the line can evoke a quiet wistfulness or a feeling of being small and perhaps unheard in a grand, silent space.

The solid, vertical red bar on the left edge stands as a stark, unyielding presence. While red can be vibrant, here its block-like form, isolated against the brown, can be interpreted as a boundary, a contained emotion, or a sense of stark separation. It does not integrate but rather stands apart, contributing to a feeling of quiet containment or an inability to escape the surrounding vast"
untitled-1965.jpg,colorField,0.0,"This abstract artwork, characterized by its symmetrical arrangement of red and blue organic shapes on a neutral, light background, offers absolutely no visual cues that would evoke sadness. The colors are vibrant and clean, not muted or somber. The forms themselves are fluid and interconnected, suggesting harmony or organic processes rather than struggle, isolation, or despair. The highly balanced and ordered composition creates a sense of calm and structure, which is antithetical to feelings of melancholy or grief. There are no figures, narratives, or atmospheric qualities that hint at loss, pain, or any other emotion associated with sadness. The image is entirely devoid of elements that could be interpreted as somber or distressing."
untitled-1953.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The painting primarily conveys a sense of raw energy, bold dynamism, and intense chromatic interplay, largely through its vibrant use of primary colors like red and yellow, and its thick, energetic impasto brushstrokes. These visual characteristics—high-chroma colors, vigorous texture, and a fragmented yet assertive composition—are typically antithetical to the visual language of sadness. Sadness in art is more commonly evoked through muted or cool color palettes, downward lines, slumped or shrinking forms, and a sense of stillness, emptiness, or heavy weight, none of which are dominant here. The overwhelming impression is one of outward expression and force, rather than introspection or sorrow. While the presence of small patches of dark blue and black could, in some contexts, hint at melancholic or somber undertones, within this highly energetic and vivid composition, they function more as strong compositional anchors or contrasts rather than indicators of profound grief or despair. The overall emotional resonance is too assertive and lively to align with the subdued or heavy nature of sadness. Any perceived sadness would be a highly subjective and minor interpretation, stemming perhaps from the raw, almost aggressive nature of the paint application, which *could* be seen as an outlet for intense emotion that *might* include some pain, but it is certainly not the primary or even a strong secondary feeling conveyed."
untitled-1969-2.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract composition dominated by vibrant shades of red, orange, and pink, with touches of light blue and lavender, evokes feelings far removed from sadness. The colors are bright, saturated, and warm, often associated with energy, passion, and joy, rather than somber or melancholic states. The translucent, overlapping layers create a sense of depth and luminosity, giving the painting an airy and dynamic quality. There are no dark, muted, or heavy tones that typically contribute to a feeling of sadness or despondency. The sweeping, energetic brushstrokes (or color fields) convey movement and vitality, lacking any sense of drooping, confinement, or desolation that might suggest sorrow. The overall impression is one of vivacity and interplay of light and color, completely devoid of the visual cues or emotional weight that would trigger or embody sadness. The minor score of 0.5 is a technical acknowledgment that an absolute zero is almost impossible in subjective human perception, but in practical terms, this painting offers no visual or emotional anchor for sadness."
untitled-1962.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The visual elements in this abstract painting offer very little direct visual language that typically evokes sadness. The dominant color, a strong and somewhat vibrant red-orange, is generally associated with energy, passion, warmth, or even aggression, rather than melancholy, sorrow, or despair, which are more commonly linked with blues, grays, or muted, desaturated tones.

The composition features a single, upright, rectangular form centrally placed on a vast, uniform cream-colored background. This simple, stable, and geometric shape lacks the drooping lines, chaotic brushstrokes, or distressed forms often used to convey sadness. There are no narrative elements, figures expressing sorrow, or themes of loss or grief depicted.

The only very subtle and highly subjective connection to sadness might arise from the sheer minimalism and the isolation of the single red block on the expansive, empty background. For some viewers, this starkness or the sense of a solitary entity might conjure a very faint feeling of loneliness or a bleak emptiness. However, this interpretation is far from universally compelling and is likely a projection of the viewer's own internal state rather than a strong emotional prompt from the artwork itself. The painting's primary emotional impact leans more towards meditative contemplation, starkness, or perhaps a quiet energy due to the color. Therefore, any evocation of sadness is extremely minimal and incidental."
untitled-1962-1.jpg!PinterestLarge.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting exhibits no visual characteristics commonly associated with the emotion of sadness. The dominant color palette consists of vibrant, highly saturated hues—bright red and two distinct shades of vivid blue. These colors are typically perceived as energetic, lively, or cool, rather than conveying the muted, dark, or desaturated tones often linked with sorrow or melancholy. Furthermore, the composition is highly structured and orderly, featuring precise, repetitive vertical stripes that create a sense of regularity and stability. This formal rigidity and perfection run counter to visual cues of sadness, which are often conveyed through drooping lines, distorted forms, or a sense of disarray. As an abstract, hard-edge work, it completely lacks any narrative, figural elements, or discernible subject matter that could convey themes of loss, grief, isolation, or human vulnerability—elements frequently employed to evoke sadness in art. The flat, uniform application of paint further contributes to an impersonal and objective aesthetic, rather than one designed to elicit deep emotional responses of sorrow. The overall impression is one of optical exploration and formal balance, devoid of any visual language or emotional weight that would suggest sadness."
untitled-1960.jpg,colorField,27.0,"The painting evokes a subtle and subdued sense of sadness, primarily through its color palette and the perceived weight of its forms. The deep, rich burgundy and the very dark purple/almost black at the bottom contribute a feeling of solemnity and gravitas. Darker, heavy colors can often be associated with introspection, melancholy, or a sense of burden, and when stacked as they are, they create a visual weight that might be interpreted as emotionally heavy. The overall stillness and lack of vibrant energy or dynamism in the composition could also lean towards a contemplative mood, which sometimes verges on quiet sorrow or pensiveness. The visible brushstrokes and slightly organic, uneven edges of the forms lend a raw, human touch that can evoke a sense of vulnerability.

However, the top block of reddish-orange, an earthy and warm tone, introduces a counterbalancing element that prevents the mood from becoming overtly mournful or despairing. The clean white background also offers a sense of space and clarity, preventing the darker colors from completely engulfing the viewer in a somber atmosphere. There is no explicit narrative of loss or suffering, and the forms are solid and grounded rather than fragmented or distressed. Therefore, any sadness experienced is mild, secondary, and more akin to a gentle melancholy or a sense of profound contemplation rather than acute grief or sorrow."
untitled-1967.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, an abstract composition of color fields, presents a palette primarily composed of warm, earthy tones: a dominant terracotta or reddish-orange, transitioning through a muted orange-brown, and culminating in a soft peach or beige stripe. These colors are inherently warm and natural, often associated with sensations of comfort, warmth, stability, and the gentle hues of autumn or earth. There are no cool, dark, or heavily desaturated colors typically linked to melancholy or sorrow. The composition itself is orderly and balanced, featuring clean, though slightly soft, vertical divisions, which convey a sense of calm and structure rather than distress or despondency. There are no jagged lines, oppressive forms, or somber textures that might evoke a feeling of sadness. The overall visual impression is one of tranquility and groundedness, entirely devoid of any elements that suggest sorrow, grief, or a melancholic state."
untitled-1974.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The visual elements within this abstract artwork present virtually no discernible cues that would evoke a feeling of sadness. The dominant color palette is vibrantly expressive, featuring a lively array of bright reds, oranges, yellows, pinks, and rich blues, which are typically associated with energy, warmth, and vitality rather than sorrow or melancholy. The application technique, characterized by spontaneous splatters, drips, and bleeding forms, creates a dynamic and somewhat chaotic aesthetic that leans towards an energetic or playful mood. There are no dark, muted, or desaturated tones that might contribute to a somber atmosphere, nor are there any heavy, drooping, or oppressive forms. The composition is entirely abstract, lacking any figurative elements or narrative content that could convey themes of loss, despair, or loneliness. The overall impression is one of uncontrolled artistic expression and vivacity, which stands in stark contrast to the visual language typically associated with sadness. While interpretation of abstract art can be subjective, there is nothing within this specific visual language – from color choice to application and overall composition – that even remotely suggests or hints at feelings of sadness. Any trace of sadness would be purely coincidental or projected without direct visual support."
untitled-1984.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting, being an abstract composition of geometric forms, lacks any narrative, figural representation, or explicit emotional cues typically associated with sadness. There are no human expressions of grief, no melancholic landscapes, nor symbols of loss or sorrow. The composition is orderly and stable, with clean lines and distinct blocks of color, which generally does not evoke feelings of distress or unhappiness. While the dominant central gray rectangle and the large lavender rectangle on the right are muted tones, they do not inherently convey sadness; they can also be perceived as calming, neutral, or sophisticated. The introduction of the vibrant orange-red stripe on the left, the golden-yellow at the top, and the teal at the bottom introduces a degree of visual interest and even warmth that counteracts any potential somberness from the gray or lavender. There is no visual tension, disarray, or darkness that would typically elicit strong feelings of sadness. Any perception of sadness would be extremely subtle and highly subjective, stemming perhaps from a very abstract association of muted tones with a lack of overt joy or dynamism, rather than a direct evocation of sorrow or melancholy. Therefore, the overall impact regarding sadness is minimal to non-existent."
untitled-1989-2.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, an abstract composition, displays a vibrant and energetic palette dominated by bright yellow, deep red, and a lively teal, with hints of orange and light pink. These colors are inherently luminous and highly saturated, typically evoking feelings of joy, energy, passion, or dynamism, rather than sorrow or melancholy. There are no cool, desaturated, dark, or muted tones that are commonly associated with sadness or a somber mood. The forms are fluid, spontaneous, and characterized by splashes and drips, suggesting an uninhibited and active process. This dynamic movement and the sense of playful, almost accidental, creation do not align with visual cues often linked to sadness, such as stillness, heaviness, drooping forms, or a sense of confinement or despair. There is no discernible subject matter or narrative element that could convey themes of loss, loneliness, grief, or any other aspect of human experience typically associated with sadness. The overall impression is one of vivacity and unrestrained expression, entirely devoid of any visual or emotional indicators that might elicit or reflect sadness."
untitled-1971.jpg,colorField,68.5,"The painting evokes a strong sense of quiet, profound sadness through several key elements. The dominant color palette consists of deep, muted purples and reddish-maroons, which are often associated with solemnity, introspection, and melancholy rather than vibrancy or joy. This atmospheric, undifferentiated background creates a vast, empty space, contributing to a feeling of loneliness or a deep, pervasive quietude that can be melancholic.

The most compelling element is the solitary, vertical, reddish-brown streak that runs down the center, slightly off-kilter. Its appearance is irregular and textured, strongly resembling a tear, a drip of liquid, or even a healed scar or wound. This visual association with weeping, bleeding, or enduring pain directly links to sadness and sorrow. The singular nature of this mark, isolated against the expansive, indistinct background, amplifies a feeling of solitude or a concentrated, solitary grief. It feels like a single, poignant memory or a deep, personal sorrow that stands out in an otherwise featureless landscape of emotion. The painting does not depict overt despair, but rather a quiet, enduring, and perhaps internal sadness, making the emotional response contemplative and deeply felt."
untitled-1985-1.jpg,colorField,5.5,"The painting primarily evokes a sense of order, structure, and visual contemplation through its minimalist and geometric composition. The large, dominant black rectangular fields could, in a highly abstract and subjective interpretation, be associated with emptiness, void, or a profound, quiet stillness. For some viewers, these abstract qualities might vaguely touch upon a sense of absence or a very subtle, introspective melancholy. However, this connection to sadness is extremely weak and indirect. The precision of the lines, the clean division of space, and the presence of vibrant, thin colored stripes (red, blue, teal, yellow, etc.) along the edges inject vitality and a dynamic visual rhythm that significantly counteract any potential somberness or desolate feelings. The overall impression is one of visual balance and formal exploration rather than an expression of sorrow or distress. Therefore, any sense of sadness derived from this artwork is minimal, highly personal, and not a prominent or intended emotional response."
untitled-february-26-1964.jpg,colorField,0.5,"This artwork, characterized by its abstract and highly stylized forms, evokes virtually no sense of sadness. The shapes, which appear as symmetrical, organic motifs resembling a central body with four radiating ""arms"" or ""drips,"" are repeated uniformly across a light, neutral background. There are several reasons why this composition fails to elicit sadness:

Firstly, the color palette consists of a warm, reddish-brown against a light cream or off-white background. These colors are generally associated with earthiness, warmth, or simplicity, and do not inherently carry the somber, melancholic, or cool tones often linked with sadness (such as blues, grays, or very dark hues). There's nothing muted, cold, or desolate about the chosen colors.

Secondly, the forms themselves are abstract and repetitive. While they have a somewhat organic quality with the ""dripping"" elements, these drips appear as intentional design features rather than suggestive of weeping, decay, or distress. They are balanced and contained, contributing to a sense of order rather than disarray or emotional turmoil. There is no representational imagery that could be interpreted as a figure in sorrow, a scene of loss, or any object symbolic of grief.

Thirdly, the overall composition is one of simplicity, balance, and pattern. The five elements are arranged in a classic quincunx pattern, providing a sense of stability and visual harmony. This ordered repetition tends to create a feeling of calm or decorative interest, which is antithetical to the disquiet or emotional weight typically associated with sadness. There is no implied narrative of struggle, longing, or despair within this orderly arrangement.

Lastly, the absence of any discernible narrative, human element, or symbolic reference prevents the viewer from connecting with any experience that might trigger feelings of sorrow or melancholy. The artwork presents itself as a purely visual, decorative, or meditative piece, detached from the human emotional landscape of sadness. Any trace of sadness would be a misinterpretation of a decorative or minimalist aesthetic as profound emotional content. The very low score acknowledges the extreme unlikelihood of this image provoking even a fleeting sense of sadness."
untitled-1995.jpg,colorField,32.0,"The artwork subtly evokes a sense of sadness, not through explicit imagery of sorrow, but through its atmospheric qualities and color choices. The dominant cool and muted color palette, consisting primarily of greens, light blues, and varying shades of gray and black, inherently lacks warmth and vibrancy. These colors are often associated with introspection, quietude, and a certain solemnity, which can contribute to a melancholic mood rather than one of cheerfulness or excitement.

The repetitive nature of the numerous vertical lines, stretching uniformly across the canvas, can also contribute to a subdued feeling. While visually structured, this endless repetition, devoid of dynamic movement or a discernible narrative, can suggest monotony or a state of quiet resignation. There's an absence of elements that typically convey joy, energy, or hope, leaving a contemplative void that, for some, can lean towards a gentle, underlying sadness or a sense of calm melancholy. It does not convey intense grief or despair, but rather a soft, pervasive solemnity."
untitled-i-2000.jpg,colorField,0.5,"The artwork, an abstract composition featuring a vibrant red band at the top and a dominant, equally vibrant orange section below, presents no visual cues that could evoke sadness. The colors themselves, red and orange, are typically associated with warmth, energy, passion, and enthusiasm, rather than melancholy or sorrow. Their high saturation and brightness contribute to a feeling of vitality and intensity, which stands in direct opposition to somber emotions. The visible brushstrokes add a sense of dynamism and texture to the surface but do not convey any sense of struggle, heaviness, or despair that might be linked to sadness. The simple, horizontal division of the canvas creates a stable and direct composition, lacking any unsettling or desolate elements. There is no narrative, subject matter, or atmospheric quality that hints at loss, grief, or any other aspect of sadness. The overall impression is one of bold color interaction and positive energy, leading to a score very close to zero for sadness."
untitled-brown-violet-2001.jpg,colorField,68.0,"The painting evokes a notable sense of sadness, though not overtly dramatic, through its color palette and compositional elements. The dominant earthy brown tones, with their varied textures and somber hues, contribute to a feeling of solemnity, weight, and perhaps even decay or a sense of things worn by time. These browns lack vibrancy, lending a grounded, yet somewhat muted and melancholic atmosphere.

The two prominent vertical purple stripes dissecting the canvas add significantly to this feeling. Deep purple can often be associated with introspection, melancholy, and even mourning, lending a serious and contemplative tone. Their rigid, vertical nature can be interpreted as barriers, confinement, or separation, which are common visual metaphors for isolation or restriction, often leading to feelings of sadness. The slight unevenness and raw quality of these lines prevent them from being purely sterile, instead hinting at a human, perhaps vulnerable, touch within this structured form.

The overall absence of bright, uplifting colors or dynamic, expansive forms directs the viewer towards a more subdued and introspective emotional space. It suggests a quiet, pervasive melancholy rather than an acute moment of sorrow, a feeling of gentle resignation or wistful reflection that aligns strongly with the emotion of sadness."
untitled-for-cool-series-1960.jpg,colorField,87.5,"The painting evokes a profound sense of sadness primarily through its dominant color palette and structural composition. The vast expanses of deep, oppressive black at the top and bottom, and particularly the heavy black band that forms the core, immediately convey a feeling of weight, emptiness, and sorrow. Black, in art, is frequently associated with grief, loss, despair, and an overwhelming void. The rich, deep red borders further intensify this somber mood; while red can signify passion or anger, in this context, when paired with such dominant black, it resonates more with raw pain, a bleeding wound, or a deeply unsettling foundation upon which the dark experiences rest.

The central, lighter, muted pink area, bisected and confined by the dark vertical element and the heavy black horizontal bands, appears incredibly vulnerable and trapped. Its faded, almost bruised hue, rather than a vibrant or hopeful one, suggests a delicate spirit or hope that has been worn down or has suffered. The dark, almost pillar-like shape cutting through this lighter segment acts as a powerful visual metaphor for something being broken, divided, or crushed, amplifying the sense of distress and fragmentation. The stark, visible brushstrokes and imperfect edges contribute to a raw, unpolished feeling, adding to the melancholic authenticity of the piece, as if observing a profound internal struggle or a burdened state. The overall impression is one of somber confinement and a heavy heart, strongly conveying the emotion of sadness."
untitled-no-30-1996.jpg,colorField,5.0,"The painting primarily features a vibrant, almost aggressive red background with a repeating pattern of black-outlined, rounded forms. Scattered across this pattern are irregular splashes of white, yellow, and dark green. There are very few, if any, elements within this artwork that directly or indirectly evoke feelings of sadness. The dominant red hue is often associated with energy, passion, or intensity, rather than melancholy or sorrow. The black outlines and the somewhat irregular, organic shapes of the primary pattern do not convey any sense of despair or grief. Furthermore, the disruptive, somewhat chaotic splashes of white, yellow, and green, while breaking the uniformity, tend to add a sense of spontaneity or raw expression rather than a somber mood. There are no discernible figures, facial expressions, or narrative elements that suggest loss, mourning, or any other cause for sadness. The overall composition lacks the muted tones, downward lines, or symbolic imagery that might typically be employed to convey a sense of sadness. The painting's aesthetic leans more towards abstract pattern and energetic disruption, leaving little room for an interpretation of profound sorrow. Any perceived sadness would likely be a very minor, highly subjective, and indirect response to the slight visual dissonance, rather than a direct emotional impact."
untitled-gray-and-mauve-1969.jpg,colorField,55.0,"The painting evokes a notable, though not overwhelming, sense of sadness, primarily through its color palette and minimalist composition. The upper dominant block of muted purplish-grey immediately sets a somber, contemplative tone. This color often carries connotations of melancholy, twilight, or a quiet solemnity, far removed from vibrancy or cheerfulness. It can feel heavy or weighted, like an overcast sky, which can contribute to a subtle feeling of emotional pressure or subduedness. The lower section, a muted brownish-pink or dusty rose, while slightly warmer, remains desaturated and lacks any uplifting qualities. Its subdued nature reinforces the overall somber atmosphere rather than alleviating it.

The stark simplicity of the two large, undifferentiated color fields, separated by a sharp horizontal line, contributes to this feeling. The lack of dynamic forms, vibrant hues, or narrative elements means there's no visual cue for joy, energy, or excitement. Instead, the composition feels still, introspective, and even somewhat stark or isolated. This quietude, when combined with the specific muted colors, can readily tip into a sense of quiet melancholy or a deep, gentle sadness rather than an active despair. It suggests a reflective state that acknowledges a certain emptiness or profound stillness, which for many, aligns with a quieter form of sorrow or wistfulness. The painting does not scream sadness, but rather whispers it through its restrained and reflective aesthetic."
untitled-red-and-orange-on-salmon-1969.jpg,colorField,15.0,"The painting primarily uses warm hues of red and orange, which are generally associated with energy, passion, warmth, and vibrancy rather than sadness. The upper block is a deep, rich red, and the lower block is a bright, luminous orange, set against a slightly lighter, muted red background. These colors tend to evoke feelings of warmth or intensity, and in some contexts, could be seen as uplifting or contemplative. There is an absence of cool colors, dark tones, or somber palettes that are more commonly linked to feelings of melancholy, sorrow, or despair. While abstract art can invite deep introspection which might, for some, lead to profound or even sad thoughts, there are no inherent visual cues within the color choices, composition, or brushwork of this specific piece that directly suggest or compel a feeling of sadness. The overall impression is one of glowing fields of color, which feels more serene or energetic than sorrowful."
untitled-no-184-2001.jpg,colorField,0.8,"The artwork exhibits an almost complete absence of elements typically associated with sadness. The dominant color palette features bright, saturated hues such as red, blue, green, orange, and magenta. These vibrant colors intrinsically convey energy and vitality rather than somberness or melancholy. There is a notable lack of muted tones, dark shades, or cool colors that often contribute to a sense of sorrow or despondency. Furthermore, the shapes within the central painted area are organic, fluid, and somewhat playful, lacking any sharp, angular, or drooping forms that might suggest distress or a downward emotional pull. The overall composition is dynamic and visually engaging, characterized by bold patterns (stripes, wavy edges) and an active interplay of forms, which contrasts sharply with the stillness or heaviness often found in art evoking sadness. There are no discernible narrative elements, figures, or symbolic motifs within the abstract work that would hint at themes of loss, despair, or grief. The artistic choices—from the lively colors to the buoyant shapes and the energetic visual rhythm—collectively generate a feeling far removed from sadness, leaning instead towards vibrancy and abstract expression."
untitled-sfe-020-lembark-i53-1984.jpg,colorField,1.5,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of sadness. Its vibrant and diverse color palette, including reds, blues, yellows, magentas, and teals, is overwhelmingly lively and energetic, rather than somber or melancholic. The application of paint, characterized by bold, gestural strokes, dynamic splashes, and irregular forms, creates a highly active and spontaneous composition. There are no heavy, dark, or muted tones that typically convey a feeling of sadness or introspection. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the work lacks any discernible figurative elements or narrative cues that might suggest themes of loss, grief, or melancholy. The overall impression is one of vivacity, movement, and expressive freedom, which stands in stark contrast to any feeling of sorrow or dejection."
untitled-no-114-2002.jpg,colorField,7.0,"The textile's color palette, featuring dominant red and blue, along with white and black, does not primarily evoke sadness. Red is often associated with energy or passion, and while blue can sometimes be linked to melancholy (""feeling blue""), the particular shade of blue used here is vibrant and bold rather than somber or desaturated. There are no narrative elements, figures, or discernible themes of loss, grief, or suffering present in the abstract pattern. The repetitive, rhythmic arrangement of the shapes and stripes creates a sense of order and visual interest rather than despair or sorrow. While the image is of an old textile, implying age or wear, this characteristic does not inherently translate to sadness; it could equally evoke nostalgia, history, or a handcrafted charm. Any perception of sadness would be highly subjective and very subtle, perhaps a fleeting, indirect association with the color blue, but this is overwhelmingly counteracted by the strong, almost decorative quality and lack of emotionally charged content. Therefore, the presence of sadness is extremely minimal."
untitled-sfm66-03-1966.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The artwork, an abstract border surrounding a large central white space, does not evoke any sense of sadness. The colors used are predominantly vibrant reds, blues, and some lighter shades, which tend to be associated with energy, passion, or calm, rather than sorrow or melancholy. There are no muted tones, somber grays, or deep, oppressive dark colors that typically convey sadness. The brushstrokes and forms are abstract and fluid, appearing as washes, smears, and layered shapes, but none of these shapes or textures possess qualities often linked to sadness, such as drooping lines, heavy masses, or fragmented, distressed forms. The composition, with its large, empty white center framed by the colored abstractions, creates a neutral or even inviting space, rather than one of isolation or despair. There are no discernible figures or narrative elements that could suggest a sad story or mood. The overall visual impression is one of abstract decoration or a dynamic frame, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger an emotional response of sadness."
untitled-in-5-parts-1987.jpg,colorField,62.0,"The paintings primarily evoke a sense of sadness through their consistent use of color and stark, minimalist composition. The dominant hues in many of these pieces, such as muted greys, deep blues, and dark browns, are frequently associated with melancholy, solemnity, and introspection. The large block of grey in the top half of several paintings, particularly the prominent grey/blue piece on the left, can be interpreted as heavy, overcast skies or a general sense of dullness and oppression. The deep blue, a color classically linked to 'the blues' or a pensive emotional state, further reinforces this melancholic atmosphere.

The simple, unadorned horizontal division of the canvases creates a sense of quietude and immobility. While this can also be calming, its starkness, devoid of vibrant detail or dynamic movement, can contribute to a feeling of emptiness or a lack of joy, which are aspects of sadness. The visible brushstrokes, while adding texture, do not convey cheerfulness or lightness; instead, they lend a somewhat raw or somber quality to the surfaces.

The overall palette across the series leans heavily towards the subdued and muted, even with colors like yellow and orange, which are not presented in a bright or uplifting manner. This consistent lack of vibrancy contributes to an overarching mood that is far from joyful or optimistic, tending"

The vibrant and diverse color palette, dominated by energetic reds, oranges, and lively blues, alongside yellows and earthy browns, inherently projects a feeling of dynamism and warmth rather than melancholy or despair. There are no muted, somber, or heavy tones that are typically associated with sorrow. The composition, characterized by spontaneous splatters, sweeping brushstrokes, and abstract forms, conveys a strong sense of movement, spontaneity, and uninhibited expression. This energetic and active visual language directly counteracts any potential feeling of stillness, heaviness, or introspection that might be linked to sadness. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, there are no figurative elements, scenes, or narratives that could depict themes of loss, grief, or emotional distress. The central white space maintains an open and bright quality, preventing any sense of enclosure or gloom.

white-roses-sing-and-sing-1976.jpg,colorField,1.0,"The painting, an abstract mosaic-like composition of predominantly white or light gray shapes separated by green lines with occasional yellow accents, evokes virtually no sense of sadness. The colors used – bright green, clean white, and hints of yellow – are generally associated with nature, light, and even cheerfulness, rather than gloom or despair. There are no dark, somber hues, nor are there any muted tones that might suggest a melancholic mood. The fragmented nature of the shapes, while suggesting brokenness or division, presents more as an organic or textural pattern, akin to cracked earth, stones, or microscopic cellular structures, rather than a visual representation of emotional distress or loss. There are no drooping lines, heavy forms, or chaotic elements that would typically convey a sense of grief or sorrow. The overall impression is one of visual pattern and perhaps a quiet, almost meditative quality, but not one that directly stimulates feelings of sadness, melancholy, or despair. Any interpretation of sadness would likely be highly idiosyncratic and not inherent to the visual language of the artwork itself."
yellow-painting-14-1995.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, a monochrome field of vibrant yellow, evokes absolutely no sense of sadness. Yellow is widely associated with joy, sunshine, optimism, and energy, all of which are antithetical to feelings of sadness. There are no discernible figures, forms, or narrative elements within the image that could imply loss, melancholy, grief, or despair. The color is bright and saturated, lacking any muted tones, shadows, or textures that might suggest a somber or contemplative mood. The sheer uniformity and brightness of the yellow actively work against any interpretation that would lead to a feeling of sadness."
yellow-line-painting-1973.jpg,colorField,0.0,"The painting, characterized by a bright, luminous yellow background and a scattering of upright, somewhat wavy strokes in a variety of light and muted colors (such as pale pink, soft green, lavender, and warm orange), offers no visual cues that evoke sadness. The dominant yellow hue is overwhelmingly associated with warmth, optimism, and light, directly contrasting with emotions of sorrow or despair. There are no dark, somber, or cold colors present that might suggest a melancholic mood. Furthermore, the forms themselves, which resemble organic elements like tall grass or abstract, slender figures, are generally upright and appear to be in a state of organic growth or gentle movement, rather than drooping, broken, or depicting any imagery typically linked to grief or distress. The overall impression is one of lightness, vitality, and even a playful rhythm, entirely devoid of any somber or mournful undertones."
white-fire-i-1954.jpg,colorField,7.0,"The painting evokes a minimal sense of sadness, bordering on none at all. The dominant visual elements – a light, airy background color and straight vertical lines – do not typically convey feelings of sorrow, despair, or melancholy. The pale blue-green field suggests spaciousness, calm, and perhaps introspection, but not a heavy or somber mood.

The most minor potential for a fleeting sense of sadness might stem from the vibrant blue line on the right. Its rough, uneven texture, in contrast to the smooth, precise beige line and the calm background, could be interpreted as a raw edge or a subtle imperfection. For some viewers, this 'rawness' might evoke a very quiet, almost subliminal feeling of vulnerability or a sense of something incomplete, which, in a deeply contemplative state, could faintly brush against a melancholic introspection.

However, there are no overt visual cues commonly associated with sadness: no dark, muted, or heavy colors, no distorted forms, no downward-sloping lines, or chaotic compositions that might suggest emotional turmoil or sorrow. The overall impression is one of serene contemplation and spatial balance, with any potential for sadness being extremely subtle, indirect, and secondary to the prevailing sense of calm and order. Therefore, the score is very low, reflecting an almost complete absence of direct emotional resonance with sadness."
washington-d-c-december-1964-10-i-1964.jpg,colorField,2.0,"The painting evokes minimal to no sadness. The dominant palette of warm, vibrant orange and deep, rich red-maroon primarily conveys feelings of warmth, energy, and groundedness rather than sorrow. Colors typically associated with sadness, such as cool blues, grays, or desaturated tones, are entirely absent. The composition, characterized by stable, horizontal bands, creates a sense of calm and order, which stands in direct contrast to the visual disruption or emotional turmoil often linked with sadness. While the bottom band is a dark, deep hue (almost blackish purple), it reads more as a weighty, stable foundation or a deep, contemplative space rather than conveying a sense of despair, emptiness, or oppression. There are no drooping forms, heavy shadows, or narrative elements that would suggest loss, longing, or melancholy. Any potential for a fleeting sense of wistfulness might be marginally inferred from the transition of colors, perhaps reminiscent of a day drawing to a close, but this is a highly tenuous and weak association with explicit sadness. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation, rich color interaction, and a profound sense of presence, rather than emotional distress."
zebra-1969.jpg,colorField,5.0,"This abstract painting, composed of numerous vertical stripes of varying widths and a diverse color palette, evokes very little, if any, sense of sadness. The colors used are predominantly bright and varied, including vibrant yellows, greens, pinks, purples, and light blues, which tend to have a more uplifting or neutral emotional resonance rather than a somber one. There are no dark, muted, or desaturated tones that are typically associated with melancholy, despair, or sorrow. The consistent verticality and regular spacing of the stripes create a sense of order, rhythm, and visual stability, which do not lend themselves to feelings of distress or emotional turmoil. There is no narrative content, no human or natural forms expressing sorrow, nor any chaotic or drooping lines that might suggest a downcast mood. The overall impression is one of visual exploration, optical play, or systematic organization of color, rather than an emotional outpouring of grief or unhappiness. The very low score reflects the near absence of any visual cues that could be interpreted as sad within the context of art."
winter-1999.jpg,colorField,32.0,"The artwork evokes a subtle and quiet sense of sadness, rather than an overt or profound emotional display. This is primarily conveyed through the choice and handling of colors and the minimalist composition. The green panel, while earthy, is a muted and somewhat desaturated tone, leaning towards an olive or sage hue. This lack of vibrancy, combined with the subtle golden-brownish variations, particularly noticeable in the corners, can suggest a sense of gentle aging, fading, or the passage of time, which can inherently carry a hint of wistfulness or quiet melancholy. It's not a fresh, lively green, but one that feels more subdued and reflective.

Similarly, the light, almost translucent quality of the left panel contributes to this delicate emotional resonance. Its soft, ethereal appearance can evoke a sense of fragility, ephemerality, or something that is light, almost disappearing, which aligns with themes of impermanence and a gentle, lingering sadness. The stark, unadorned simplicity of the two rectangular forms, separated yet side-by-side on a plain white background, also creates a quiet, contemplative space. This minimalism, devoid of dynamic elements or strong contrasts, can lead to a mood of introspection or a slight feeling of isolation, which can touch upon a quiet, understated form of sadness or pensiveness. There is an absence of vibrant"
white-sun-box-1966.jpg,colorField,8.0,"The emotion of sadness is exceptionally subtle in this painting, almost to the point of being imperceptible. The expansive, dominant off-white fields, while often perceived as neutral, can for some evoke a sense of quiet emptiness or vastness. This emptiness, devoid of warmth or specific narrative, might brush against a very mild feeling of isolation or a contemplative, slightly melancholic quietude. Furthermore, the faint, irregular outlines of the central rectangle suggest an ethereal presence, something barely formed, fading, or impermanent. This delicate hint of transience or absence could intellectualize a whisper of sadness concerning things lost or fleeting.

However, these potential evocations of sadness are profoundly diminished by other elements. The most striking counterpoint is the prominent, vibrant lime"
yellow-abstract-1961.jpg,colorField,35.0,"The painting subtly evokes a sense of quiet sadness primarily through its weighty central form and muted color palette. The large, dominant brownish-orange mass, with its grounded and somewhat imposing presence, carries a feeling of 'heaviness' that can metaphorically resonate with the emotional weight of sadness or a burdened state. Its earthy, subdued tone, combined with the off-white and pale blue in the background, creates a quiet, almost somber atmosphere rather than an uplifting one. This lack of vibrant or dynamic colors contributes to a mood that leans towards introspection and melancholy.

Furthermore, the stark, thin black lines, particularly the isolated vertical line reaching upwards into the pale, empty space, can suggest a feeling of solitude or detachment. These lines act as subtle dividers or boundaries, potentially hinting at separation or a solitary existence, themes often associated with sadness or loneliness. The overall composition is marked by its profound stillness and lack of dynamic movement, contributing to a contemplative mood that, while not overtly despairing, carries a gentle undercurrent of solemnity and a quiet, unspoken melancholic resonance, akin to a heavy heart in a moment of quiet introspection."
yellows-1969.jpg,colorField,5.7,"The artwork presents an abstract composition primarily featuring warm and luminous colors: a bright orange and a clear yellow dominate the lower portion, separated by a thin, vibrant red line. These hues are generally associated with warmth, vitality, and positive emotional states, such as joy or energy, rather than sadness. The upper band of olive green, while a more subdued color, acts as a grounding element and does not possess the desaturated, cool, or somber qualities typically linked with feelings of melancholy or sorrow. Its earthy tone provides a natural contrast rather than evoking a sense of despair or heaviness.

The geometric and rectilinear arrangement of the color blocks contributes to a sense of order, stability, and balance within the composition. There are no disquieting or chaotic forms, nor are there any elements that suggest struggle, loss, or emptiness. The lines are clean and purposeful, reinforcing a sense of calm and considered design rather than emotional distress. Furthermore, as an abstract piece, there is no narrative content, human figure, or symbolic representation that could carry an explicit or implicit message of sadness. The texture, appearing relatively smooth with some subtle variations typical of a print, does not convey agitation or a troubled state. The overall visual impression is one of contemplative harmony and a quiet, robust presence, rather than anything that would evoke or resonate with the emotion of sadness. The strong presence of vibrant colors largely counteracts any potential for the more muted green or the abstract nature to be interpreted as somber."
