afternoon-in-the-park.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork presents a serene and aesthetically pleasing scene: a woman is peacefully seated in a vibrant, sunlit garden. Her attire is elegant, and her expression appears contemplative or observational, devoid of any hint of revulsion, unease, or physical sickness. The environment is meticulously rendered with bright, harmonious colors, depicting lush greenery, well-maintained paths, and healthy plants. There are no elements of decay, squalor, grotesque imagery, unpleasant textures, or any visual cues typically associated with the emotion of disgust. The overall impression is one of tranquility, beauty, and quiet contemplation, which stands in complete opposition to any sensation of disgust."
after-the-rain.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject matter, an architectural scene with water and reflections, is inherently neutral or even beautiful. There are no elements within the composition that could be interpreted as repulsive, unclean, decaying, or offensive. The colors are vibrant and light, contributing to an atmospheric and visually pleasing effect rather than anything unsettling. The Impressionistic style, characterized by loose brushstrokes and a focus on light and color, does not lend itself to conveying themes associated with disgust. There are no grotesque figures, disturbing textures, or hints of decay or contamination. The water, despite its dark reflections in some areas, appears dynamic and reflective, not stagnant or polluted in a way that would elicit an adverse visceral reaction. The overall impression is one of tranquility and aesthetic appeal, entirely devoid of any qualities that would trigger disgust."
a-misty-morning.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that would elicit a feeling of disgust. The scene depicts a tranquil and idyllic natural landscape with a river, gentle hills, and a soft, overcast sky. The figures present by the riverbank appear to be two individuals, possibly children or young adults, engaged in a peaceful, natural activity like bathing or resting by the water. Their partial undress is contextually appropriate for a river setting and is not depicted in any way that is titillating, inappropriate, or visually offensive. The colors are natural and harmonious, the brushwork conveys a sense of light and atmosphere, and the overall composition is calm and inviting. There is no indication of decay, filth, disease, violence, suffering, or anything morally or aesthetically repugnant that would trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. The painting instead evokes feelings of peace, natural beauty, and perhaps nostalgia for a simpler time, entirely devoid of any repulsive qualities."
a-fisherman-s-cottage.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, ""Garden at Giverny"" by Claude Monet, is characterized by its vibrant colors, lush greenery, and the depiction of a serene garden scene. There are no elements within the artwork that evoke disgust. The subject matter is entirely benign and aesthetically pleasing, featuring flourishing plants, a well-tended path, and figures engaged in a seemingly peaceful moment. There is no representation of decay, filth, disease, violence, suffering, or any morally repugnant themes. The Impressionistic style, with its soft, dabbing brushstrokes and focus on light and atmosphere, contributes to an overall sense of beauty and tranquility, directly opposing any feeling of revulsion or aversion. The slight score of 0.5 acknowledges the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal reaction, but objectively, the painting presents absolutely nothing that would trigger a typical feeling of disgust."
a-grey-day-carmel.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a serene coastal landscape under a cloudy sky. The subject matter includes a stretch of ocean with foamy waves breaking against rocky outcrops, a rugged headland covered in green and reddish-brown vegetation, and distant hills blending into the horizon. There are no elements within the painting that evoke feelings of revulsion, contamination, decay, or anything physically or morally offensive. The colors are natural and harmonious, representing the blues of the sea and sky, and the greens and earth tones of the land. The textures depicted, such as the rough rocks and the various types of foliage, are consistent with a natural environment and do not suggest anything unclean or repulsive.

The overall impression is one of natural beauty and tranquility, leaving no room for a sensation of disgust."
a-youngster-in-the-forest.jpg,impressionism,2.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The color palette is composed of soft, muted tones—greens, yellows, browns, and pale pinks—which are generally pleasant or neutral and lack any sickly or jarring combinations often associated with revulsion. There are no garish or putrid hues that might suggest decay or unhealthiness. The forms within the artwork are abstract and fluid, resembling elongated, organic shapes, possibly trees or abstract figures, along with a simplified depiction of a human figure in the lower left. None of these forms are grotesque, distorted in a disturbing manner, or depict anything that would be inherently repulsive, such as bodily fluids, gore, decay, or unsanitary conditions. The loose, watery quality of the watercolor medium itself contributes to a gentle and ethereal atmosphere rather than one of harshness or discomfort. There is no narrative element or subject matter that hints at moral offense, contamination, or any other common triggers for disgust. The overall impression is one of placidness or gentle introspection, completely devoid of any visual cues that would provoke a feeling of aversion or revulsion. The score of 2 is assigned to acknowledge the bare minimum possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly subjective response, but objectively, the painting presents no elements that would typically elicit disgust."
a-spanish-barracks-1906.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This watercolor painting by John Singer Sargent offers a serene and contemplative glimpse into an everyday scene, likely in a Mediterranean or North African setting. There is absolutely nothing within the composition, subject matter, or execution that could evoke a feeling of disgust. The figures are depicted engaged in casual, non-threatening interaction, possibly conversing or resting. There is no representation of squalor, decay, disease, violence, suffering, or any form of repulsive behavior or unsanitary conditions. The lighting is bright and natural, casting soft shadows, and the color palette is composed of warm, earthy tones, muted blues, and reds, all of which are visually harmonious and pleasant. Sargent's masterful watercolor technique is characterized by its fluidity, transparency, and ability to capture light and atmosphere, further contributing to the painting's aesthetic appeal rather than any sense of revulsion. The scene is benign, quiet, and aesthetically pleasing, entirely devoid of any visual cues that might trigger a sensation of disgust."

The scene depicts a serene and open landscape with a few figures engaged in what appears to be a calm, leisurely activity. The colors are natural and harmonious, predominantly greens, browns, and blues, which contribute to a sense of peacefulness rather than repulsion. There is no depiction of decay, filth, violence, grotesque imagery, physical deformities, or any other subject matter typically associated with triggering disgust. The visual information presented is clean, orderly, and benign, offering nothing for the viewer's senses to recoil from."
a-mother-and-son-seated-by-a-wall-before-the-sea.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would elicit a sensation of disgust. The scene depicts a woman engaged in what appears to be knitting or mending, seated beside a young child in an outdoor, natural setting, possibly under an olive tree. The figures are rendered with simple, earthy tones and do not display any signs of illness, extreme unhygiene, decay, or deformities that would be repulsive. The environment, consisting of trees, grass, and a stone wall, is also devoid of anything that could be considered foul, decaying, or unsanitary. There are no grotesque details, no depiction of waste or bodily fluids, and no imagery that suggests putrefaction, contamination, or anything inherently offensive to the senses. The overall impression of the painting is one of quiet contemplation or everyday life, which is antithetical to feelings of disgust."
anemones.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a vibrant cluster of flowers, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The colors are bright and lively, predominantly warm reds, oranges, and pinks, which are generally associated with beauty, energy, and pleasant feelings rather than repulsion. The subject matter itself – a bouquet of blossoms – is inherently beautiful and commonly appreciated, presenting no elements that are unclean, decaying, offensive, or visually unpleasant. There is no depiction of grime, decay, or anything that suggests a foul odor or an undesirable texture. The loose, painterly style emphasizes the freshness and organic beauty of the flowers, further reinforcing a positive aesthetic response and entirely precluding any sensation of revulsion or disgust."
along-the-woods-in-spring-1889.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is a serene and natural landscape in what appears to be early spring, characterized by blooming trees with white blossoms, verdant fields, a clear sky, and a rustic dirt path. There are no elements within the composition that suggest decay, filth, putrefaction, unsanitary conditions, or anything grotesque or repulsive. The colors are fresh and light, contributing to a sense of pleasantness and tranquility. The textures, while visible as brushstrokes and craquelure (cracking of paint due to age), are inherent to the artistic medium and technique, rather than depicting anything inherently disgusting within the subject matter. The small figures on the path are too indistinct to convey any action or state that would elicit disgust. The overall impression is one of natural beauty and a peaceful rural setting, which is antithetical to feelings of revulsion. The score of 0.5 acknowledges the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or extremely abstract association, but practically, the painting offers no visual cues for disgust."
at-the-theater-1879.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would evoke any sense of disgust. The artwork depicts a woman in a serene pose, holding a fan, rendered in soft pastels. The colors are warm and inviting, and the subject herself appears calm and poised. There is no imagery of decay, filth, violence, grotesque figures, unpleasant textures, or morally objectionable content. The aesthetic is gentle and pleasant, designed to capture a moment rather than provoke a strong negative visceral reaction. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent in the viewing experience of this particular piece."
amsterdam-in-the-snow(1).jpg,impressionism,1.0,"The painting, ""Snow at Argenteuil,"" depicts a winter landscape, likely an urban or semi-urban area by a river, covered in snow under an overcast sky. The color palette is muted, consisting primarily of whites, browns, grays, and dark blues, characteristic of a cold, perhaps dreary, winter day. While the scene may evoke feelings of coldness, quiet contemplation, or even a touch of melancholy due to its subdued tones and the harshness implied by winter, there is virtually nothing within it that would trigger a feeling of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with contamination, decay, filth, bodily effluvia, or things that are morally repugnant or viscerally repulsive. This painting presents none of these elements. The snow, despite being depicted with varying textures and shades, covers the landscape, creating a sense of cleanliness rather than grime. The structures and figures are rendered in an impressionistic style, lacking explicit detail that might suggest squalor or decay. There are no elements that imply rot, foul odors, disease, or any form of physical or moral abomination. The scene is aesthetically composed and merely portrays a natural phenomenon and human habitation within it. Therefore, a score of 1 is assigned, acknowledging the extremely remote possibility that someone might find the subtle muted tones or the bleakness of winter slightly unappealing, but it falls far short of evoking actual disgust."
amagansett-long-island.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The scene depicted is a serene and idyllic rural landscape, characterized by lush green trees, quaint houses, and a peaceful field where a horse or donkey grazes. All elements within the composition appear clean, healthy, and well-maintained within their natural context. There are no signs of decay, squalor, filth, disease, or any unhygienic conditions. Furthermore, the subject matter does not suggest any moral abomination, violence, suffering, or anything ethically repugnant that could trigger revulsion. The colors are vibrant and harmonious, contributing to a pleasant and inviting atmosphere. The overall impression of the artwork is one of tranquility and natural beauty, which is entirely contrary to any sensation of disgust."

Disgust is typically triggered by things that are perceived as contaminating, unhygienic, decaying, or morally repulsive. The image presents a serene natural scene with loose, impressionistic brushstrokes and a harmonious palette of greens, blues, purples, browns, and soft yellows. There are no depictions of filth, decay, waste, bodily fluids, or anything physically repulsive. The subject matter is an outdoor environment, rendered with an aesthetic rather than a visceral or abject quality. There is nothing visually jarring, unpleasant, or repugnant in the composition, color choices, or subject matter that could induce a feeling of revulsion or nausea. The overall impression is one of natural beauty and artistic interpretation, entirely devoid of any cues that might trigger a disgust response."
autumn-fog.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes a sense of vastness, perhaps desolation or quietude, but absolutely nothing that would trigger an emotional response of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual cues suggesting decay, filth, disease, moral depravity, or something inherently repulsive or offensive to the senses. The depicted landscape is barren and muted in color, but it contains no elements indicative of spoilage, putrefaction, grime, or any form of physical or moral abomination. The indistinct figures and structures in the middle ground are too vague to convey any action or state that could be construed as disgusting. The overall aesthetic, while perhaps somber or melancholic, is not unappealing in a way that would provoke aversion or repugnance. There is no visual information that suggests anything foul, vile, or morally objectionable. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent in the experience of viewing this artwork."

There are no elements within the composition—no decay, pollution, unsettling imagery, or anything visually offensive—that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or distaste. On the contrary, the painting exudes a sense of peace, beauty, and natural harmony, which are antithetical to the emotion of disgust. Every brushstroke and color choice contributes to an aesthetically pleasing and calming visual experience, leaving no room for any negative or repulsive emotional response."
afternoon-sun-at-the-alcazar-of-seville-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""The Alhambra, Granada,"" by Joaquín Sorolla, presents a vibrant and luminous scene that is overwhelmingly positive in its aesthetic and emotional impact. The subject matter itself—a majestic architectural complex and its meticulously designed gardens with flowing fountains—is inherently beautiful and evokes admiration rather than aversion. The color palette, dominated by warm yellows and ochres of the building against a deep blue sky and lush greens of the foliage, is harmonious and pleasing to the eye, completely devoid of any sickly, decaying, or unsettling hues that might provoke revulsion. The depiction is clean, bright, and orderly; there are no elements suggesting filth, decay, waste, or any other unsanitary conditions. The light is brilliant and inviting, highlighting textures and forms in a way that contributes to the sense of grandeur and serenity. There are no disturbing figures, grotesque details, or unpleasant visual narratives implied within the artwork.

birch-grow.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a peaceful and pleasant park or garden scene, characterized by a pathway winding through a grove of slender trees, with lush green foliage and distant figures. There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that could evoke a sensation of disgust. The subject matter is natural and serene, the colors are harmonious and reflective of a healthy environment, and there is an overall sense of tranquility.

Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent."
belkino-birches-1907.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subject matter, a natural landscape featuring birch trees, is inherently neutral and often associated with beauty or serenity, not revulsion. The artistic style, with its visible brushstrokes and muted, harmonious color palette, is aesthetically pleasing and does not contain any elements that are grotesque, dirty, putrid, or morally offensive. There are no disturbing figures, unpleasant textures that simulate decay or filth, or any thematic content that would trigger a sensation of revulsion. The scene is clean, open, and depicts a quiet moment in nature, completely devoid of anything that might cause a feeling of disgust."
barges-on-pontoise-1872.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would elicit a sensation of disgust. The scene depicts a serene river landscape with several boats, likely barges or tugboats, moored along the bank. The water, while dark in some areas due to reflections and depth, does not appear polluted or putrid; rather, it suggests natural depth and movement. Smoke emanates from the chimney of the largest boat, a common and expected feature of such working vessels, without conveying any sense of overwhelming or offensive pollution. The surrounding environment, with its lush green trees and clear sky, is depicted as natural and inviting. There are no portrayals of decay, disease, grotesque figures, unpleasant bodily functions, or any substances or conditions typically associated with revulsion or strong aversion. The painter's technique, characterized by visible brushstrokes and a focus on light and atmosphere, aims to capture a moment rather than provoke strong negative visceral reactions. The overall impression is one of calm observation, rendering the presence of disgust entirely absent."
bougival-1878.jpg,impressionism,2.5,"The painting, an Impressionist landscape, evokes very little to no feeling of disgust. The scene depicts a river with a distant bridge and industrial elements like a chimney and what appear to be factory buildings on the far bank. While industrialization can sometimes be associated with pollution or grime, these elements are rendered atmospherically and not in a manner that highlights dirt, decay, or any physically repulsive aspects. The water, though not crystal clear, appears to be a moving river, typical in color and texture, without any visual cues of stagnation or extreme contamination that would trigger revulsion. The foreground riverbank is rocky and covered with sparse vegetation, appearing natural rather than neglected or unsanitary. There are no disturbing figures, objects, or colors that would incite a visceral reaction of disgust. The overall palette of muted blues, purples, and browns, while not vibrant, is not sickly or putrid. The painting's subject matter and artistic execution primarily convey a sense of calm observation rather than any offensive or nauseating qualities."
bridge-over-the-loire-1892.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is a serene and picturesque landscape featuring a river, a bridge, and a peaceful natural setting with trees and boats. The colors are predominantly natural and harmonious, comprising various shades of blue for the water and sky, greens for the grass, and earthy browns for the tree trunks and branches. There are no elements whatsoever that could be perceived as foul, repulsive, unsanitary, decaying, or aesthetically unpleasant in a way that would trigger a feeling of disgust. The composition is calm and inviting, presenting a view of nature that is clean, orderly, and visually pleasing."
brittany-goose-girl-1908.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the painting ""Autumn in Holland"" by Gari Melchers, I find absolutely no elements that elicit a feeling of disgust. The scene depicted is one of pastoral tranquility and natural beauty. The vibrant golden foliage of the trees, indicative of autumn, creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. The white geese, often associated with innocence and domesticity, appear clean and healthy as they mill about. The woman, dressed in traditional attire, is presented without any features or actions that could be construed as unpleasant or repulsive. Her posture is calm, and she appears to be engaged in a simple, everyday activity. There are no signs of decay, squalor, disease, grotesque imagery, or moral turpitude within the composition. The colors are harmonious, the lighting is soft and inviting, and the overall mood is one of peace and serenity. There is nothing visually or thematically present in the artwork that would trigger an emotional response of revulsion, aversion, or distaste."
boulevard-des-batignolles.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts an ordinary street scene, possibly on a damp or misty day, with figures, horse-drawn carriages, and bare trees lining a boulevard. There is nothing inherently or tangibly disgusting in the subject matter itself. The muted color palette, dominated by browns, greys, and muted yellows, creates a somewhat somber or melancholic atmosphere, but not one that would typically trigger disgust. There are no elements of filth, decay, grotesque imagery, or morally repugnant acts depicted. The figures are impressionistically rendered, and while some are carrying umbrellas, suggesting rain or mist, this weather condition is merely unpleasant, not repulsive. The scene is one of everyday life, and while it might evoke feelings of melancholy or the dreariness of a bad weather day, it lacks any visual cue that would elicit a strong sense of revulsion or nausea, which are hallmarks of disgust. The score is marginally above absolute zero only because some viewers might find the general dampness or muted tones to be slightly unappealing in a very mild, non-offensive way, but this is a stretch and not true disgust."
barbara.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The artwork presents a reclining female figure rendered with warm, earthy tones and loose, expressive linework. There are no elements within the composition—such as grotesque imagery, depictions of decay, filth, violence, or morally repugnant acts—that would typically elicit a feeling of revulsion or strong aversion. The figure's pose appears relaxed and natural, and her expression is neutral to contemplative, certainly not conveying anything unsettling or disturbing. The dominant color scheme of browns, oranges, and reds contributes to a warm and somewhat intimate atmosphere, rather than one of sickness or unpleasantness. The artistic style, with its washes and sketch-like quality, is aesthetically engaging and does not contain any visual cues that would trigger a visceral negative reaction associated with disgust."
cagnes-landscape-1908-1.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, an Impressionistic landscape depicting trees with vibrant, loose brushstrokes, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever.

boulevard-montmartre-winter-morning-1897.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""Boulevard Montmartre, Mardi Gras"" by Camille Pissarro, is a quintessential Impressionistic urban landscape. It depicts a bustling Parisian street scene, characterized by soft light, atmospheric effects, and visible brushstrokes capturing movement and life. There are no elements within the visual composition or subject matter that evoke feelings of disgust. The scene shows ordinary city life with people, horse-drawn carriages, and buildings, all rendered with an aesthetic focus on light and atmosphere rather than any form of squalor, decay, violence, or grotesque imagery. While a real 19th-century street might have had elements like horse manure, the painting does not emphasize or visually render such details in a way that would trigger revulsion. Instead, the focus is on the dynamic flow of the city, the play of light on wet surfaces, and the overall impression of a lively urban environment. There is nothing repulsive, offensive, or unsanitary depicted that would lead to a sensation of disgust."

The water appears calm and reflective, not murky or polluted. The structures are intact, and the boats seem well-maintained, without any visible signs of decay or unpleasantness. The human figures are small and integrated into the scene, posing no disturbing presence. The overall color palette, featuring blues, grays, and natural earth tones, is harmonious and creates a serene rather than an unsettling atmosphere.

The painting depicts a young child, likely a girl, in a large, frilly hat and a bright orange dress. The subject matter itself – a child portrait – is inherently innocent and often evokes feelings of tenderness or curiosity, not revulsion. The child's expression is placid and engaging, looking directly at the viewer without conveying any negative emotions or anything that might be perceived as unpleasant. The colors used are vibrant and appealing (especially the dominant orange), and the textures visible from the pastel medium are simply characteristic of the artistic technique, not indicative of anything grotesque or repulsive.

christ-in-the-garden-of-gethsemane-1901.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes a strong sense of mystery, solitude, and perhaps a quiet solemnity due to its deep shadows and the isolated figure. However, there are no elements within the artwork that elicit or provoke the emotion of disgust. The scene lacks any visual cues typically associated with disgust, such as bodily fluids, decay, gore, filth, disease, or any depiction of grotesque or morally reprehensible actions. The figure appears to be a person in a robe, not deformed or repulsive. The dark, wooded environment, while atmospheric and potentially eerie, is not portrayed as unhygienic or decaying in a way that would trigger revulsion. The overall impression is one of contemplative introspection or quiet apprehension, not physical or moral abhorrence."
clump-of-chrysanthemums-garden-at-petit-gennevilliers.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts a vibrant and dense cluster of chrysanthemums, rendered with a rich array of colors including whites, yellows, reds, and oranges, against a backdrop of green foliage. The subject matter itself—flowers—is inherently natural and widely appreciated for its beauty, fragrance, and vitality, none of which are associated with revulsion or repugnance. The brushwork, while expressive and textured, does not simulate any unpleasant tactile sensations or substances such as decay, slime, or filth. There are no elements of putrefaction, sickness, unhygienic conditions, or grotesque forms present in the composition. The darker tones in the lower sections merely represent shadowed foliage and depth, not decay or an unsanitary environment. The overall impression conveyed by the painting is one of natural abundance and aesthetic pleasure, which stands in complete opposition to any sensation of disgust."
crimea-yayla.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a serene, natural landscape composed of a dry, yellowish field in the foreground, a line of green trees and bushes in the mid-ground, and a light-colored mountain or cliff face under a muted sky. There is absolutely nothing in this image that evokes a feeling of disgust. The colors are earthy and natural, not sickly or repulsive. The subject matter—a landscape—is inherently neutral or aesthetically pleasing, with no elements that suggest decay, filth, unhealthiness, moral depravity, or anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion. The brushwork, while visible, does not create any unsettling textures or forms. The scene is devoid of any disturbing figures, objects, or environmental conditions that might lead to a sense of physical or moral offense. The score is a nominal 0.5 rather than a flat 0, acknowledging the infinitesimally small chance that someone might find an extremely subtle, perhaps subconsciously negative association with dry fields or muted skies, but this is purely theoretical and not supported by the visual content. For all practical purposes, disgust is entirely absent from the emotional response to this artwork."
cliff-at-fecamp.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, ""Cliffs at Pourville"" by Claude Monet, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subject matter itself—a natural landscape featuring rugged cliffs, a vast sea, and an open sky—is inherently devoid of any elements that typically trigger feelings of aversion or revulsion. There are no depicted signs of decay, contamination, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque deformities, or anything that could be perceived as unsanitary or repulsive. The color palette, dominated by soothing blues, greens, and earthy yellows, is harmonious and natural, completely lacking any jarring or putrid tones that might be associated with unpleasant or decaying matter. The Impressionistic brushwork, which captures light, movement, and atmosphere, does so in a way that is visually pleasing and serene, rather than depicting anything grotesque or unsettling. The scene conveys a sense of natural beauty and tranquility, which stands in complete opposition to any feeling of disgust."
cuirassier-1881.jpg,impressionism,5.0,"The emotion of disgust is minimally evoked by this painting. There are no elements within the artwork that are inherently repulsive, grotesque, decaying, or explicitly filthy in a manner that would trigger a strong visceral reaction of disgust. The subject, a lone rider on horseback in a desolate landscape, conveys themes of isolation, struggle, or determination rather than revulsion. While the terrain in the foreground is rendered with thick, impasto brushstrokes that suggest a rough, perhaps muddy or snow-churned ground, it does not reach a level of putrefaction or squalor that would typically elicit disgust. The dark, brooding sky adds to a sense of somberness or foreboding, but not an offensive visual quality. Any trace of disgust would be extremely subtle and subjective, possibly stemming from a slight aversion to the perceived harshness or bleakness of the environment, but this is a very weak interpretation and not the primary emotional impact."
desert-and-mountains.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a serene desert landscape with mountains in the background, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subject matter itself—a natural vista—is inherently neutral or even aesthetically pleasing, and certainly contains no elements typically associated with revulsion, such as decay, filth, violence, grotesque forms, or unsettling human or animal conditions. The color palette of muted purples, pinks, blues, and earthy tones is harmonious and visually calming rather than jarring or repulsive. The broad, impressionistic brushstrokes capture light and atmosphere without introducing any unpleasant textures or details. There is nothing within the composition, theme, or execution of this artwork that would trigger a visceral or cognitive feeling of revulsion or distaste. The scene is one of quiet grandeur, far removed from anything that might induce disgust."
dancers-in-light-blue-rehearsing-in-the-dance-studio.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork, by Edgar Degas, depicts a scene from a ballet rehearsal. The subjects are dancers in various poses, a male figure (likely a dance master or patron), ballet slippers, and a violin. The color palette is earthy and subdued, characteristic of Degas's work, featuring shades of red-browns, purples, and muted blues. The brushwork, while loose, does not render anything in a way that is grotesque, unsanitary, or otherwise offensive. There are no depictions of violence, decay, filth, or any subject matter that would typically trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or strong aversion. The scene is a candid observation of daily life in a dance studio, presented in a realistic and artistic manner, devoid of any elements that could be perceived as repulsive or morally objectionable."
christ-with-the-canaanite-woman-and-her-daughter-1909.jpg,impressionism,2.5,"The emotion of disgust is minimally, almost negligibly, present in this painting. Disgust is typically evoked by something offensive, repulsive, morally repugnant, or physically unclean/diseased. This artwork does not present elements that strongly trigger such a response.

Firstly, there are no graphic details that would cause physical revulsion, such as gore, explicit filth, or detailed decay. The loose, impressionistic brushwork and subdued lighting soften any potential harsh realities.

Secondly, the subject matter, appearing to be a compassionate or spiritual encounter, does not depict any morally repugnant acts. On the contrary, the scene suggests an interaction of care or profound human experience, often evoking empathy rather than aversion.

The only element that could remotely (and very weakly) be associated with disgust is the slumped figure on the far right, which appears to be a person in extreme poverty or suffering from illness. For some viewers, the generalized concept of destitution or sickness might, on a very subconscious and minimal level, trigger a slight feeling of discomfort or aversion if they associate such conditions with unpleasantness. However, the painting portrays this figure with a sense of pathos and vulnerability, aiming to elicit pity, sympathy, or contemplation of suffering, rather than a visceral feeling of revulsion. The artistic rendering avoids any specific details that would make the figure appear physically repulsive or unsanitary.

Therefore, while an extremely sensitive viewer might experience a fleeting and indirect sense of discomfort related to the implied squalor of poverty, the painting itself does not utilize any visual language or thematic elements designed to actively provoke a strong or even moderate feeling of disgust. The overall atmosphere is more solemn, empathetic, or spiritually profound."
elisabeth-avenue-after-rain.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts a bustling street scene, likely after rain, characterized by a muted, earthy color palette. The subject matter includes buildings, trees, people, and horse-drawn carriages, all rendered in a somewhat impressionistic or illustrative style. There are no elements of decay, filth, gore, unhygienic conditions, moral depravity, or anything that would typically provoke revulsion or strong disapproval. The overall impression is one of a mundane, perhaps slightly melancholic, urban environment, devoid of any visual cues that would trigger a physiological or psychological response of disgust."
dewey-s-arch.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a grand, bustling urban scene, characterized by monumental architecture, a clear sky, and orderly crowds. There are no elements within the artwork that inherently trigger disgust. The subject matter is clean and well-maintained public spaces, devoid of any representations of decay, filth, bodily effluvia, disease, or grotesque imagery. The color palette is bright and harmonious, featuring clean whites and blues, which contribute to a sense of clarity and openness rather than anything repulsive. The figures are depicted in a stylized, somewhat distant manner, offering no specific details that would elicit a visceral negative reaction. While a minuscule score of 0.5 is assigned to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an extreme, highly idiosyncratic personal aversion to *any* visual input, there is absolutely nothing objective or commonly understood in this particular painting that aligns with the emotion of disgust. The overall impression is one of a vibrant, orderly, and aesthetically pleasing public sphere, entirely antithetical to feelings of repulsion or revulsion."
etang-also-known-as-the-pond.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The artwork depicts a serene, albeit muted, landscape with a body of water reflecting the sky and distant land. The colors are predominantly earthy tones of browns, grays, and dark greens, which contribute to a somber or contemplative mood, but are not inherently repulsive. There are no elements within the composition – such as decay, filth, distorted or unsettling figures, violence, or anything visually unappealing or offensive – that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or nausea, which are hallmarks of disgust. The scene is natural and tranquil, presenting a view that might evoke feelings of peace, introspection, or melancholy, but certainly not disgust."
dansatoare-oriental.jpg,impressionism,5.2,"The painting evokes an extremely low level of disgust. There are no elements within the artwork that are inherently repulsive, grotesque, or vulgar. The subject matter, a dancer with a snake, is presented in an artistic and somewhat exotic manner, rather than aiming to provoke revulsion. The partial nudity of the figure, while present, is depicted in a classical or artistic context, devoid of any lewdness or exploitation that might trigger moral disgust for some viewers; it is not presented in a way that is physically unsettling or unpleasant. Similarly, the presence of the snake, while potentially a trigger for individuals with ophidiophobia, is stylized and not depicted in a menacing, venomous, or graphically unsettling way that would induce widespread physical disgust. Its interaction with the dancer appears more symbolic or performative than threatening. The vibrant color palette and loose brushwork contribute to an expressive and dynamic scene, not a repulsive one. Any potential for disgust would be highly subjective and extremely mild, likely stemming from individual aversions (e.g., specific phobias of snakes) or very strict moral interpretations of artistic nudity, rather than from any universally recognized disgusting content within the artwork itself."
fall-scene-near-sisterdale-1909.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The scene presented is a bucolic, natural landscape featuring children playing in a field, cattle grazing, and expansive open space under a vast sky. There are no elements within the composition that are inherently repulsive, offensive, or decaying. The colors are earthy and harmonious, the figures are innocent, and the subject matter (nature, childhood, pastoral life) is universally benign and often associated with pleasant feelings. There is nothing visually or thematically grotesque, unhygienic, or morally reprehensible that would trigger a sensation of aversion, nausea, or revulsion. The brushwork, while painterly, does not render anything in a way that distorts or disfigures the subjects into something unpleasant. Consequently, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent from the experience of viewing this artwork."
etaples-la-canache-low-tide-1890.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a serene, albeit overcast, coastal or estuarial scene, characterized by a wide river leading towards a distant village and boats docked along its banks. The colors are muted, dominated by blues, greys, and earthy browns, which contribute to a tranquil or perhaps slightly melancholic atmosphere. There are no elements within the composition that are inherently repulsive, grotesque, or unsanitary. The water, while perhaps showing tidal flats or muddy areas, appears as a natural part of the landscape rather than something foul or contaminated. The figures by the water seem to be engaged in everyday activities, and the boats and village buildings are depicted without any disturbing or unpleasant details. There is nothing in the brushwork, subject matter, or overall aesthetic that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or strong aversion. The minimal score is merely to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly subjective response, but objectively, the painting lacks any characteristic that typically elicits disgust."
don-juan-s-encounter-with-the-stony-gues.jpg,impressionism,73.0,"The painting strongly evokes disgust primarily through the depiction of multiple human figures in what appear to be lifeless or severely injured states, sprawled and contorted on the ground. The chaotic arrangement of bodies, combined with overturned furniture (like the chair in the lower right), clearly indicates a scene of violence and profound disorder. The muted, dark palette, punctuated by reddish and brownish tones, hints at blood, bruising, or decay, further enhancing a sense of grim reality and repulsion. The general disarray and the disturbing aftermath of whatever event transpired are inherently unsettling and provoke a feeling of revulsion. While the painting does not employ hyper-realistic gore, the implication of death, suffering, and the violation of the human form is powerfully conveyed through the figures' postures and the overall grim atmosphere, prompting a strong sense of aversion and unease."
farmer-to-work-1883.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that evoke a sense of disgust. The artwork depicts a person engaged in labor, likely in a field, bending over. The scene is rendered in an impressionistic or post-impressionistic style with visible brushstrokes and a muted, earthy color palette of greens and browns. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues of decay, putrefaction, filth, bodily fluids, moral repugnance, or things that are inherently repulsive to the senses or values. This painting contains none of these elements. The subject matter is a simple, everyday human activity; the colors are natural and do not suggest anything sickly or decaying; and the composition is straightforward. There is no indication of anything unsanitary, grotesque, or morally objectionable that would provoke a feeling of revulsion or disgust."
figure-and-pool-1917.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of disgust independently, I find absolutely no elements within this painting that would elicit such a response. The subject matter depicts a figure seemingly interacting with or about to enter a body of water within a natural landscape. The human form is rendered with an expressive, almost abstract quality, devoid of any detailed features that could suggest illness, decay, or deformation. The color palette, while earthy and deep with browns, reds, and vibrant blues and greens, conveys the rich tones of nature rather than anything putrid, unclean, or nauseating. There are no indications of filth, waste, disease, or any morally repugnant acts. The brushwork is fluid and energetic, characteristic of watercolor, which contributes to a sense of vitality and movement rather than stagnation or unpleasantness. There are no disturbing textures, offensive smells implied, or sights that would activate the brain's disgust response pathways. The overall impression is one of connection with nature, physical engagement, and perhaps contemplation or exhilaration, none of which align with feelings of disgust."
fishing.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The scene depicts a tranquil, overcast day on a body of water, with a solitary figure in a canoe near the shore. There are no elements within the composition—no unpleasant colors, offensive textures, disturbing subject matter, or imagery suggesting decay, filth, or any form of revulsion—that would trigger such an emotional response. The muted palette and serene atmosphere contribute to a sense of calm and perhaps melancholy, entirely devoid of anything that might be considered repulsive or disagreeable to the senses."
french-landscape-i-1877.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a sensation of disgust. The scene depicts a serene and natural landscape, featuring a gently sloping grassy hill dotted with trees, and an artist's plein air setup complete with an easel, umbrella, and chair. The colors are fresh and vibrant, primarily various shades of green, suggesting health and vitality. The light is soft and inviting, and the overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and natural beauty. There are no elements of decay, squalor, unpleasant textures, disturbing imagery, or anything that would activate a feeling of revulsion or a strong aversion. The meticulous detail in the foliage and the orderly presentation of the artist's tools further contribute to a sense of pleasantness, completely devoid of any potential for disgust."
esbo-o-para-o-vel-rio-boceto-para-el-velorio-sketch-for-the-wake-1893.jpg,impressionism,45.0,"The primary source of disgust in this painting stems from the grotesque and unsettling depiction of the third figure's face on the right. The artist has rendered the facial features with a profound distortion, characterized by deeply hollowed, dark eye sockets that convey an almost skeletal or decayed appearance. The mouth is agape in a wide, dark chasm, contributing to a sense of vacancy and an unnatural, almost skull-like grimace. This visual presentation deviates significantly from a healthy, living human form, evoking a visceral sense of revulsion. The shadowy, almost necrotic quality of the face, coupled with its extreme contortion, triggers a feeling of physical unpleasantness and repellence, akin to the discomfort one might feel when encountering something perceived as decomposing or severely disfigured. While not overtly depicting gore or filth, the artist's deliberate choice to render the face in such a visually disturbing manner directly appeals to the sensation of disgust through its grotesque aesthetic."
from-dieppe-to-arques-river.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a peaceful landscape depicting a river, trees, and a distant house, contains no elements that typically evoke a sense of disgust. There is an absence of visual cues such as decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, harmful substances, or anything that would be perceived as offensive, repulsive, or morally objectionable. The colors are natural and calming, and the water, though green in hue, appears as a typical river color rather than suggesting putrefaction or toxicity. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and natural beauty, offering no visual or thematic stimuli to trigger revulsion or nausea, which are hallmarks of disgust. Any minimal score is purely to acknowledge the infinitesimal and highly subjective possibility that a viewer might have an extreme, atypical aversion to a slightly murky water color, but this is far from a common or intended reaction."
flood-at-giverny-1897.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, depicting a misty, watery landscape with bare trees, offers very little to provoke a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by things that are offensive to the senses, such as decay, filth, contamination, or unhygienic conditions. This scene, while perhaps somber or melancholic due to its muted palette and bare branches, does not present any elements that are visually repulsive, putrid, slimy, or suggestive of decay or unhealthiness. The water appears natural, albeit flooded, and the trees are simply bare, not diseased or rotting in a way that would be visually sickening. There is no indication of waste, grime, or anything that would trigger a visceral sense of revulsion. The overall atmosphere is ethereal and quiet rather than offensive. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is practically absent when viewing this artwork."
garden-in-the-west-end-of-berlin-1925.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts a lush, vibrant garden scene with trees, a winding path, and an abundance of brightly colored flowers, predominantly reds and yellows. The overall impression is one of natural beauty, tranquility, and visual pleasure. The subject matter itself – a cultivated garden – is universally appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and connection to nature. The brushwork, though loose and painterly, effectively conveys light and texture without appearing messy or unkempt in a way that would suggest filth, decay, or anything unhygienic. There are no disturbing elements, grotesque figures, offensive objects, or unsettling narratives present. The colors are fresh and harmonious, and the light suggests a pleasant outdoor setting. There is simply no visual cue or underlying theme that could trigger a visceral sense of revulsion, repulsion, or strong disapproval typically associated with the emotion of disgust."
flowers-in-a-vase.jpg,impressionism,3.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The subject matter—a still life of plants in a vase—is inherently natural and generally aesthetically neutral or pleasing, rather than repulsive. There are no elements within the composition that depict decay, filth, bodily fluids, or any other visual cues typically associated with eliciting a feeling of revulsion or strong aversion. The colors are muted and earthy, and while some of the foliage, particularly the darker, somewhat gnarled leaves in the lower cluster, might be interpreted as slightly wilted or past their prime, this natural process of aging or fading is depicted with an artistic sensibility and does not cross the threshold into representing putrefaction or an unhygienic state. The visible brushstrokes and soft rendering contribute to a tranquil, observational mood rather than highlighting any potentially unpleasant details. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation rather than a sensory assault that would trigger disgust."
girl-in-a-doorway.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is one of rustic charm and tranquility: a quaint cottage with a thatched roof, surrounded by lush, vibrant greenery and bathed in natural light. The figure standing in the doorway appears to be a person going about their daily life in a simple, unthreatening setting. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, filth, disease, moral depravity, violence, or anything that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or aversion. The colors are harmonious and natural, the composition is inviting, and the subject matter is benign. The overall impression is one of peace and pastoral beauty, which stands in complete opposition to any feeling of disgust."
gateway-tangier-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The scene depicts a tranquil architectural setting, likely a street or courtyard, with figures in traditional attire. There are no elements that suggest physical repulsion, such as filth, decay, gore, disease, or anything unhygienic. Nor is there any visual information to provoke moral disgust, as the subject matter is benign and depicts ordinary human presence within a historical or cultural context. The color palette is warm and earthy, with harmonious blues and yellows, and the brushwork creates an atmospheric quality rather than anything jarring or offensive to the eye. The overall impression is one of calm observation and aesthetic appeal, completely devoid of any stimuli that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion."
grove-of-olive-trees-in-bordighera.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke a sense of disgust. The artwork depicts a grove of olive trees, rendered with characteristic Impressionistic brushstrokes, showcasing vibrant natural colors of greens, blues, and earthy reds. The subject matter itself—trees and a natural landscape—is inherently benign and often associated with beauty and tranquility rather than repulsion. There is no depiction of decay, filth, unhygienic conditions, gore, or anything that would trigger a visceral negative reaction. The textures, while painterly, do not suggest anything unpleasant or slimy. The composition and color palette contribute to a harmonious, natural scene, entirely devoid of any visual cues that might incite feelings of revulsion or distaste."
gladiolas-in-a-vase-1875.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a vibrant still life of flowers, offers no elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The bouquet is lush and colorful, dominated by what appear to be gladioli and lilies in various shades of red, pink, and white, with abundant green foliage. The flowers themselves are depicted with a lively, fresh appearance, characteristic of Impressionistic brushwork that emphasizes light and vitality rather than decay or decline. There are no signs of wilting, rotting, or unpleasant textures that might suggest spoilage or grime. The blue and white vase is decorative and appears clean, resting on a crisp white tablecloth, further contributing to an overall impression of cleanliness and aesthetic pleasure. The dark background, rather than being ominous, serves to highlight the brilliance of the flowers. There is nothing unsanitary, grotesque, or visually offensive in the composition, color palette, or subject matter that could trigger a sensation of disgust. The fallen petals on the table add a touch of naturalism and movement rather than suggesting messiness or neglect. The entire scene is one of beauty and natural abundance, directly opposing any feeling of revulsion or distaste."
green-hills-and-farmland.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a serene and idyllic rural landscape, offers no visual elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The scene portrays rolling green hills, dense trees, a quaint white house nestled amidst nature, and winding roads bordered by stone walls. The colors are natural and harmonious, primarily consisting of various shades of green, earthy browns, and muted grays under a soft, light sky. There is an overall sense of peace, tranquility, and natural beauty. Disgust is typically associated with something revolting, unclean, offensive, or sickening. None of these qualities are present in the artwork. There is no decay, filth, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, or anything visually unpleasant or offensive to the senses. The subject matter is wholesome and calming, and the artistic execution itself does not present any jarring or repulsive qualities. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing in this image that could reasonably trigger a feeling of disgust."
harbor-in-hel-1934-1.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that elicits any feeling of disgust. The subject matter is a serene and somewhat idyllic coastal or harbor scene, featuring boats on calm water and houses nestled on a hillside under a cloudy sky. The colors are generally pleasant and harmonious, leaning towards earthy tones with pops of yellow, red, and green. The brushwork, while visible, is not chaotic or unsettling. There are no disturbing elements, no signs of decay, filth, or anything repulsive. The overall impression is one of tranquility and quaintness, completely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger revulsion or nausea."
havana.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a vibrant and sun-drenched urban scene, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The artwork's brilliant palette, dominated by warm yellows and oranges contrasted with serene blues, creates an overwhelmingly positive and luminous atmosphere. There is nothing depicted—no grotesque figures, repulsive textures, unhygienic conditions, or morally reprehensible actions—that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or physical recoil. The bustling street scene, filled with charming architecture, horse-drawn carriages, and pedestrians, is portrayed with an energetic and impressionistic touch that suggests vitality and pleasant activity. The clean lines, cheerful light, and harmonious composition actively work against any sensation of unpleasantness, offensiveness, or nausea commonly associated with disgust. The visual experience is one of warmth and liveliness, completely devoid of any element that could be perceived as repulsive or objectionable."
hilltown.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting elicits no sensation of disgust whatsoever. There is nothing depicted within the artwork that is physically repulsive, such as decay, filth, gore, or distorted forms that might trigger a visceral negative reaction. The subject matter—a vibrant European townscape with a river, bridge, and figures—is benign and presents no elements that could be considered offensive, morally reprehensible, or aesthetically jarring to the point of revulsion. The colors are lively and harmonious, the brushwork, while energetic, does not create an impression of chaos or ugliness, and the overall scene conveys a sense of ordinary daily life rather than any disturbing or unsettling narrative. Consequently, the painting completely lacks any visual or thematic cues that would evoke a feeling of disgust."
houses-in-provence.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting presents a serene and pastoral scene featuring rustic architecture and natural elements. There are absolutely no visual cues within the artwork that would evoke a sensation of disgust. The subject matter—buildings with red tiled roofs nestled amidst lush trees—is inherently benign and commonly associated with tranquility and beauty, rather than repulsion. The colors used are earthy and natural, predominantly greens, browns, reds, and muted yellows, which are harmonious and do not suggest decay, putrefaction, or unhygienic conditions. The brushwork, while impressionistic, does not render textures that appear slimy, grimy, or otherwise unpleasant to the touch. There is no depiction of filth, disease, bodily fluids, violence, or any form of degradation that typically triggers a visceral reaction of disgust. The atmosphere conveyed is one of calm and rustic charm, entirely devoid of any disturbing or repulsive elements."
houses-of-parliament-in-winter.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. Monet's ""Houses of Parliament"" series is renowned for its ethereal beauty, atmospheric light, and masterful depiction of a serene London landscape at different times of day. The soft, blending colors of the sunset sky—pinks, oranges, and purples—reflected in the shimmering blues and golds of the Thames, create an impression of tranquility and beauty. The Houses of Parliament themselves are rendered as a majestic, albeit hazy, silhouette, stripped of harsh detail and presented almost as a dreamlike apparition. There is no depiction of decay, squalor, grotesque figures, disturbing scenes, or anything physically or morally repulsive. The brushwork, while evident, contributes to the overall impressionistic beauty rather than suggesting anything unsettling. The subject matter, composition, and color palette are all conducive to feelings of calm, wonder, or aesthetic appreciation, leaving no room for any sensation of revulsion or disgust."
home-fields.jpg,impressionism,1.5,"The painting, a landscape featuring bare trees, a rustic fence, and a distant building, evokes very little to no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically a strong, visceral aversion to something repulsive, offensive, or contaminated. There are no elements in this artwork that suggest filth, decay (beyond the natural cycle of bare trees, which is not presented repulsively), disease, gore, or any form of contamination or moral repugnance. The old, weathered fence posts might suggest disrepair or neglect, but this does not translate into a feeling of disgust; rather, it contributes to a rustic or perhaps slightly unkempt aesthetic. The colors are earthy and the light suggests a natural, quiet scene. There is nothing visually offensive, repulsive, or sickening about the depiction of the land, the flora, or the human structures. Any trace of disgust would be extremely minimal, possibly stemming from a highly subjective and unusual interpretation of the bareness of the trees or the roughness of the fence as 'unpleasant' in a way that borders on the repulsive, but this is a significant stretch from the common understanding of the emotion."
ice-lock-port-villez.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a serene depiction of a winter landscape with ice floes on a river, evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by things that are unhygienic, putrid, morally repugnant, or visually grotesque. None of these elements are present in Monet's artwork. The ice floes, while suggesting a cold environment, appear clean and natural, reflecting the ambient light. The water, sky, and distant hills are rendered with cool, muted tones that convey atmosphere rather than any sense of filth or decay. There are no disturbing subjects, foul textures, or unpleasant narratives that could provoke revulsion. The small boat and the distant steamboat, with its billowy white smoke, are integrated harmoniously into the scene, appearing as natural components of a peaceful, albeit chilly, moment. The overall impression is one of calm observation of a natural phenomenon, entirely devoid of anything that might be considered offensive or repulsive to the senses."
hoarfrost-1890.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is a serene and peaceful landscape, featuring a distant village or collection of buildings with a prominent church steeple, surrounded by trees, and a broad, open foreground that appears to be a field or body of water. The color palette is muted and harmonious, consisting of soft blues, greens, browns, and ochres, typical of a watercolor or pastel rendition, possibly suggesting an autumnal or wintery light. There are no grotesque figures, disturbing subjects, offensive imagery, or elements of decay, filth, violence, or moral corruption that are commonly associated with the emotion of disgust. The overall aesthetic is one of tranquility and possibly nostalgia or quiet observation. There is nothing visually or thematically that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or distaste."
in-the-garden-at-maurecourt.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that evoke any sense of disgust. The scene depicts two figures, likely women, enjoying a leisurely moment in a lush, green garden. The subject matter is entirely benign and pleasant – people sitting on grass under the dappled light of trees. The figures appear serene and composed. There is no depiction of decay, filth, disease, injury, moral corruption, or any other quality typically associated with the emotion of disgust. The colors are vibrant and natural, primarily greens and warm tones, contributing to a sense of tranquility and beauty. The brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, lends an airy, light quality to the scene, further enhancing its idyllic nature. Every aspect of the painting, from its subject to its execution, conveys a sense of peaceful enjoyment and aesthetic pleasure, making any feeling of disgust entirely incongruous with the visual information presented."
in-the-hills-southwest-texas-1912.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork presents a serene and natural landscape, featuring a blue sky with soft clouds, lush green trees with robust trunks, gently rolling hills in the distance, and foreground vegetation that includes arid-region plants like cacti. The colors are earthy and calming, and the brushwork, while visible, does not suggest anything unpleasant or unhygienic. There is no decay, filth, distorted forms, or morally reprehensible subject matter depicted. The overall impression is one of tranquility and natural beauty, completely devoid of any stimuli that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or distaste."

The scene depicted is serene and picturesque, featuring charming houses reflecting in calm water under a pleasant sky. The colors are vibrant and harmonious, dominated by warm browns, greens, and blues, which contribute to a sense of tranquility rather than unease. There are no grotesque figures, no representations of decay, filth, or unpleasant bodily substances. The subject matter itself—a Dutch landscape with characteristic architecture—is inherently benign and often considered beautiful or quaint. The Impressionistic style, with its focus on light, atmosphere, and pleasant outdoor scenes, further removes any potential for such a negative emotional response. The clean lines of the houses, the reflective quality of the water, and the gentle clouds all contribute to an overall impression of peacefulness and beauty, standing in direct opposition to anything that might be considered revolting or offensive."
isle-of-brehat-1892.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicts a serene and natural coastal landscape with boats in a bay under an overcast sky. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, filth, pollution, bodily fluids, gore, disease, or any other subject typically associated with revulsion.

koncha-zaspa-ozernaya-1985.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The scene depicts a young woman in a modest swimsuit standing contemplatively in a sunlit field of wildflowers, with a natural landscape of trees and water in the background. The watercolor medium lends a soft, luminous quality to the image, characterized by a palette of gentle greens, earthy browns, and touches of pink and blue. There are no elements within the composition—such as decay, filth, grotesque figures, unsettling textures, or disturbing subject matter—that would typically trigger a sensation of revulsion or unease. The subject's posture and expression are serene, and the natural setting appears idyllic and inviting. The artistic style is harmonious and pleasant, further contributing to a feeling of calm and beauty rather than anything remotely unpleasant or disgusting."
lake-in-the-mountains-1899.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a serene mountain landscape with a body of water and natural vegetation, contains absolutely no visual elements that could elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by something repulsive, unsanitary, decayed, or morally offensive.

The overall impression is one of tranquility and natural beauty, entirely devoid of anything that would trigger revulsion."
jardin-du-luxembourg.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting depicts a serene and natural landscape, featuring a body of water reflecting the surrounding trees and a distant, indistinct town. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that could be interpreted as unhygienic, putrid, decaying, offensive, or morally repugnant. The colors are earthy and harmonious, the water appears calm and reflective, and the foliage is rendered in a naturalistic manner. There are no disturbing forms, unpleasant textures, or any suggestion of a repulsive subject matter. The overall impression is one of tranquility and natural beauty, which is the antithesis of emotions like disgust. The score is not an absolute zero only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association, but objectively, the painting contains nothing to provoke disgust."
kwiaty.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting elicits an almost negligible degree of disgust, scoring extremely low on the scale. The subject matter itself—a vibrant bouquet of yellow flowers in a vase—is traditionally associated with beauty, nature, and domesticity, none of which are typical triggers for revulsion. The flowers appear fresh and lively, with no signs of wilting, decay, or infestation that might provoke a sense of contamination or unpleasantness. The color palette, dominated by warm yellows, earthy browns, and a deep teal, is harmonious and natural, devoid of any sickly, grotesque, or jarring combinations often linked to feelings of nausea or distaste. The brushwork, while painterly and expressive, does not create textures that suggest sliminess, grittiness, or anything unsanitary. There are no elements in the composition that could be interpreted as unhygienic, putrid, or physically repulsive. The overall impression conveyed by the artwork is one of calm, warmth, and natural beauty, fundamentally counter to the sensation of disgust. Any minimal score acknowledges the remote possibility of an extremely idiosyncratic or abstract association, but objectively, the painting presents no visual cues commonly recognized as disgusting."
la-jolla-arbor.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is one of idyllic beauty and tranquility, featuring a lush, vine-covered veranda overlooking a serene, bright blue sea. The vibrant greens of the foliage and the striking reds of the flowers (likely geraniums) contribute to a sense of natural vitality and aesthetic pleasure. There are no elements of decay, filth, grime, unhygienic conditions, or anything visually repulsive. The light is bright and inviting, and the overall composition fosters a feeling of peace and natural beauty, entirely devoid of any characteristics that would trigger revulsion or nausea."
landscape-cassis-1931.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The scene depicted is a serene and natural landscape, likely in spring, featuring blossoming trees and what appear to be young vines in cultivated ground. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are offensive to the senses, such as decay, filth, putrefaction, grotesque imagery, or morally reprehensible acts. This painting contains none of these. The colors are soft and natural, the forms are organic and peaceful, and the overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and natural beauty. There is nothing visually or thematically disturbing, repulsive, or unhygienic presented in the artwork that could possibly elicit a sensation of revulsion or aversion."
landscape-2.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating this painting for its capacity to evoke disgust, I find no elements whatsoever that would trigger such an emotional response. The artwork presents an abstract or impressionistic landscape, characterized by a palette of rich greens, earthy browns, calming blues, and touches of warm reds and yellows. These colors, while vibrant, blend harmoniously and depict natural forms like hills, water, and foliage without any discernible visual cues associated with repulsion. There is no representation of decay, filth, disease, bodily fluids, grotesque figures, or any disturbing subject matter that could incite a visceral reaction of disgust. Furthermore, the brushwork and overall aesthetic are painterly and expressive, but not in a manner that suggests ugliness, contamination, or any form of physical or moral aversion. The scene is a serene and somewhat idyllic natural view, devoid of any narrative or symbolic content that might lead to feelings of moral or cognitive disgust. Therefore, based purely on the visual information presented, the painting registers a complete absence of elements capable of eliciting disgust."
late-afternoon-giverny-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes a feeling of disgust. The artwork is a tranquil landscape, likely an Impressionistic or Post-Impressionistic piece, depicting a serene natural scene with houses nestled among trees. The colors are harmonious, primarily shades of green, blue, and earthy tones, which are pleasing to the eye. The brushwork is gentle and atmospheric, particularly in the hazy background. Disgust is typically associated with repulsion, revulsion, or a strong aversion to something offensive, foul, unsanitary, or morally repugnant. This painting contains none of these elements. There is no depiction of decay, filth, violence, grotesque imagery, or anything that would trigger a visceral negative reaction. The overall impression is one of calm and natural beauty, making a score of 0 for disgust entirely appropriate."
landscape-in-la-roche-guyon-1887.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this landscape painting that evokes a sense of disgust. The subject matter itself—a verdant valley with rolling hills, trees, and quaint houses—is inherently natural and serene, far removed from anything that would typically trigger revulsion. The color palette, dominated by warm greens, yellows, and earthy browns, with touches of vibrant blue sky and red rooftops, is harmonious and inviting; there are no sickly, jarring, or decaying tones. The loose, impressionistic brushwork contributes to a vibrant and lively atmosphere, rather than suggesting any form of grime, decay, or unpleasant texture. Furthermore, there are no discernible elements of squalor, disease, gore, or any thematic content that could be interpreted as physically or morally repulsive. The overall impression conveyed by the artwork is one of idyllic beauty and tranquility, which stands in stark opposition to any sensation of disgust."
inside-the-studio-of-the-painter-with-errazuriz-damsel.jpg,impressionism,32.5,"The emotion of disgust evoked by this painting is subtle and primarily psychological, rather than visceral. It stems from a combination of the unsettling subject matter and the specific handling of color and texture.

Firstly, the central figure, a doll or mannequin reflected in the mirror, possesses an uncanny quality that can trigger a mild form of revulsion. Its porcelain-white face contrasted with exaggerated red lips and rouged cheeks, coupled with wide, somewhat vacant eyes, creates an artificial and disturbing appearance. This artificiality, bordering on the grotesque, can evoke a sense of unease or aversion, as if witnessing something that is meant to be human-like but is fundamentally lifeless and unsettlingly distorted. The slightly disheveled white costume on this doll-like figure further contributes to a sense of something once pristine that has become neglected or corrupted, subtly hinting at decay or contamination, which are common triggers for disgust.

Secondly, the dominant color palette of deep reds and browns, applied with thick, impasto brushstrokes, can contribute to a feeling of griminess or a raw, almost visceral atmosphere. These murky tones, particularly in the shadowed areas and the background, can suggest organic decay, dried blood, or internal matter, themes often associated with disgust. The heavy, almost muddy texture of the paint itself adds to this sense of a cluttered or even unsanitary environment.

However, there are no explicit depictions of gore, bodily fluids, rot, or clear signs of disease that would typically elicit a strong, immediate physical reaction of disgust. The feeling is more akin to a low-level psychological revulsion stemming from the uncanny, the slightly grotesque artificiality, and the implied sense of decay or an unsettling lack of vitality, rather than outright contamination or grossness. Therefore, while present, the feeling of disgust is not overwhelming or the primary emotional response intended by the painting."
laundresses-on-the-banks-of-the-touques.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are no elements within this painting that are likely to evoke a sensation of disgust. The scene depicts a quiet, everyday activity: two women washing laundry by a river. The environment, though perhaps mundane or rural, does not portray any unsanitary conditions, decay, filth, or visually offensive material that would trigger a feeling of revulsion. The water appears as a natural body of water, the land is a typical riverbank, and the figures are engaged in a common chore. There are no disturbing or unpleasant visual textures, odors implied, or subjects depicted (such as vermin, waste, or gore) that are typically associated with the emotion of disgust. The color palette, while somber with muted greys and browns, does not contribute to a feeling of repulsion; rather, it suggests an overcast day or a general atmosphere, not an unappealing one. The painting lacks any visceral or moral triggers for disgust."
london-st-paul-s-cathedral-1890.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The artwork, a watercolor and ink sketch depicting a serene view of a cityscape along a river, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are offensive, repulsive, contaminated, or morally repugnant. This image contains none of these qualities. The subject matter – an urban landscape with St. Paul's Cathedral in the background, a river, a ship, and riverbank foliage – is aesthetically neutral to pleasing. The colors are soft and natural, and the artistic style is light and sketch-like, presenting the scene in a non-confrontational or disturbing manner. There are no depictions of decay, filth, violence, grotesque forms, or anything that would physically or morally offend the viewer. The cleanliness of the water and the orderly composition further contribute to an absence of any visceral negative reaction. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is practically non-existent when viewing this piece."
morning-on-the-seine-clear-weather-02.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a ""Water Lilies"" series work by Claude Monet, evokes feelings of serenity, tranquility, and natural beauty. The soft blues, greens, and whites, along with the shimmering reflections on the water, create a calm and immersive atmosphere. There are no elements within the painting—neither in its subject matter (a peaceful pond with flora), its color palette, its composition, nor its impressionistic style—that could conceivably trigger a sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically associated with something repulsive, offensive, unsanitary, or morally objectionable. This artwork presents none of these qualities; it is, by all aesthetic measures, pleasant and visually harmonious. Consequently, the score for disgust is zero, indicating a complete absence of this emotion in response to the artwork."
morning-on-the-pond.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""Misty Morning,"" presents a tranquil and serene natural landscape. The soft, hazy light, the calm water with lily pads, and the verdant trees create an atmosphere of peace and quiet beauty. There are no elements within the composition that could be interpreted as unhygienic, decaying, offensive, or visually repulsive. The colors are soothing cool tones, and the subject matter—a still body of water, lush foliage, and a rustic shed—is inherently devoid of any features that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or aversion. The scene evokes calmness and perhaps a sense of melancholy or introspection, but absolutely no feelings of disgust."
mending-the-sail-1896.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"Joaquin Sorolla's ""Sewing the Sail"" is a painting that radiates light, warmth, and a sense of shared, productive activity. There is absolutely nothing within this artwork that could evoke the emotion of disgust. The scene depicts a group of individuals, appearing to be a family or community members, collaboratively working on a large expanse of clean, white fabric, presumably a sail. The figures are portrayed as healthy and engaged, with expressions ranging from focused concentration to gentle smiles. The setting is an idyllic outdoor space, bathed in brilliant sunlight, with lush green vines and colorful flowers providing a vibrant backdrop. There are no elements of decay, filth, disease, violence, moral transgression, or any aesthetically unpleasant or repulsive imagery. The fabric itself is pristine white, suggesting cleanliness rather than anything soiled or unhygienic. The overall impression is one of harmony, industry, and the simple beauty of everyday life, all of which are antithetical to feelings of revulsion or disgust. Therefore, the painting registers a complete absence of this emotion."
moon-on-the-lake-1907.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by something physically or morally offensive, repulsive, or sickening, such as decay, filth, or grotesque imagery. The scene depicted is a serene, dark landscape at what appears to be dusk or night, featuring a calm body of water reflecting a prominent red orb (likely the moon or sun). The colors are deep blues and greens, with the striking contrast of the red light. The elements present—water, distant land, trees, a small boat—are all natural and presented in a tranquil, even somewhat melancholic, manner. There is nothing in the composition, color palette, subject matter, or implied narrative that is in any way unsanitary, grotesque, decaying, or morally reprehensible to trigger a feeling of revulsion or nausea. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation or natural beauty, which is antithetical to the emotion of disgust."
nasturtiums.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The subject matter, nasturtiums with their vibrant orange flowers and fresh green leaves, is inherently beautiful and natural. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, filth, disease, or anything rotten or offensive to the senses. The colors are warm and inviting, dominated by earthy browns and oranges in the background, which complement the lively greens and bright oranges of the plants. The brushwork, while visible and painterly, does not create any texture that would be perceived as repulsive or unsettling. The overall impression is one of simple beauty and natural vitality, entirely devoid of any characteristic that could trigger a feeling of revulsion or distaste."
madame-manet-in-conservatory-1879.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a portrait of a woman, contains virtually no elements that would typically evoke a feeling of disgust. There is no depiction of gore, decay, bodily fluids, disease, deformity, or any imagery associated with filth or contamination. The subject's expression is calm and pensive, showing no signs of revulsion or nausea. Her attire is a dark, dignified dress, appearing clean and orderly. The background consists of lush green foliage and delicate white flowers, presenting a natural and aesthetically pleasing environment. The colors are generally harmonious and earthy, and the brushwork, while loose, does not create any visually jarring or repulsive textures. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation or everyday life, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger a visceral sense of aversion or disgust. A minimal score is given only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic and highly subjective response, but for the vast majority of viewers, disgust would not be an aroused emotion."
marble-steps.jpg,impressionism,1.0,"The painting, depicting a serene view of a Venetian canal, evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The overall atmosphere is one of quietude and historical charm, rather than anything repulsive or off-putting. There are no explicit visual cues typically associated with disgust, such as decay, squalor, refuse, unsanitary conditions, or grotesque imagery. The buildings appear aged but well-preserved, and the stone quay is clean and orderly. The water, while a deep greenish-brown, is rendered with rippling textures that suggest movement and life, rather than stagnation or putrefaction. It appears as typical canal water, perhaps slightly murky due to depth or reflections, but not visibly contaminated or foul in a way that would trigger a visceral reaction of disgust. There is no depicted litter, slime, or unpleasant odorous elements. The very low score reflects the near-complete absence of any stimuli that would provoke this emotion; any minuscule score above zero is merely to acknowledge the most remote possibility that an individual might perceive the water's natural murkiness as marginally unappealing, though certainly not disgusting."
normans-woe-gloucester-massachusetts.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The scene depicts a serene and picturesque harbor with sailboats, calm water, and a rocky, natural shoreline. The colors are harmonious and pleasant, dominated by greens and blues in the water, earthy tones in the land, and reddish-brown sails. The subject matter is inherently tranquil and aesthetically pleasing, far from anything that would trigger revulsion, aversion, or a visceral negative reaction. There are no disturbing images, no signs of decay, filth, disease, or anything rotten or foul.

The individual in the water appears to be engaged in a serene and natural activity, adding to the tranquil and inviting atmosphere. The texture created by the brushstrokes, while visible, enhances the impression of natural light and form rather than suggesting anything gritty or repulsive.

okhotino-september-1915.jpg,impressionism,1.0,"The painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. There are no visual elements present that typically trigger this emotion, such as decay, filth, disease, violence, or anything morally repugnant. The scene depicts a rustic landscape with a building and trees under a cloudy sky. While the building might appear old or weathered, it does not suggest squalor or decomposition. The ground appears to be a natural path, free from refuse or unsanitary conditions. The colors are muted and atmospheric, conveying a sense of weather or mood rather than anything foul or repulsive. There is simply nothing in the composition, subject matter, or artistic execution that would elicit a visceral feeling of revulsion or aversion in the viewer.

The scene depicted is a stylized landscape featuring a prominent tree with what appears to be a small, miniature city nestled within its upper branches. The sky is dramatic with swirling, textured clouds. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are foul, repulsive, unclean, grotesque, or morally offensive. There are no elements within this artwork that fit these criteria. The colors, while somewhat muted, are not sickly or off-putting. The textures, created by the visible brushstrokes, are artistic and do not convey anything putrid or decaying. The fantastical element of a city in a tree might be considered surreal or whimsical, but it is not inherently disgusting; it does not suggest decay, pollution, or anything that would cause a feeling of aversion or nausea. The composition is balanced, and the subject matter is benign and imaginative, completely devoid of any content that would provoke a visceral negative reaction associated with disgust."
place-de-la-madeleine-2.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. It depicts a lively, albeit muted, street scene, likely in an urban setting like Paris, with horse-drawn carriages, pedestrians, and elegant buildings. The overall impression is one of atmosphere and observation, with reflections on the wet ground suggesting a recent rain. There are no elements within the artwork that are visually offensive, grotesque, unhygienic, or morally reprehensible. The colors are subdued but not unpleasant, and the subject matter is a common and generally benign depiction of daily life. The artistic style itself, an impressionistic approach, does not contain anything that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or strong aversion. Therefore, the emotional response of disgust is entirely absent when viewing this piece. I assign a minimal non-zero score to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association, but objectively, the painting offers no grounds for such an emotion."
place-de-l-opera-caf-de-la-paix.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust.

There are no elements within the composition that are visually repulsive, grotesque, or suggestive of decay, squalor, or moral depravity. The figures are well-dressed and engaged in ordinary city life, the buildings are grand, and even the wet street, while implying rain, is rendered in a way that creates beautiful reflections and depth rather than conveying grime or unpleasantness. The artistic style itself, with its impressionistic brushstrokes and focus on light and atmosphere, does not lend itself to conveying sensations that would elicit disgust. There is no implied malodor, unsanitary conditions, or any visually offensive content."

Monet's Impressionistic style, characterized by soft, visible brushstrokes and a focus on light and color, creates an atmosphere that is gentle and contemplative, rather than jarring or repulsive. The color palette consists of natural greens, blues, and earthy tones, which are harmonious and pleasing to the eye. There are no disturbing elements, no grotesque figures, no scenes of decay, violence, or unpleasantness of any kind. The composition is balanced, and the overall effect is one of peace and natural beauty.

port-of-dieppe-evening.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, an Impressionist landscape, evokes feelings of tranquility, contemplation, and aesthetic appreciation, primarily through its depiction of light and atmosphere over a body of water with distant buildings.

The brushwork, while loose, serves to capture the ephemeral quality of light and reflection, contributing to its artistic merit rather than any form of aversion.

There is nothing unhygienic, grotesque, offensive, or visually unpleasant presented in the artwork that would trigger a physiological or emotional response of disgust in a viewer. The overall impression is one of peaceful observation rather than any form of repulsion."
prayer-in-the-saint-pierre-cathedral-in-geneva-1882.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a church interior during a sermon or service, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The scene is one of quiet solemnity and reverence. There are no elements within the artwork that trigger typical or atypical responses associated with disgust, such as physical revulsion (e.g., decay, disease, filth, grotesque imagery, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions), or moral revulsion (e.g., cruelty, injustice, depravity, corruption). The figures are dressed modestly and appear attentive and respectful. The architectural details, the soft lighting from the stained glass, and the overall muted color palette contribute to a peaceful and contemplative atmosphere. The artist has chosen a subject and rendered it in a manner that is visually clean, morally benign, and emotionally neutral or positive, completely devoid of any stimuli that would provoke a feeling of disgust."
rainbow.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a wide landscape under a muted sky with a rainbow, contains absolutely no elements that would evoke a sensation of disgust. The subject matter is entirely natural, featuring a peaceful, albeit somewhat somber, marshy landscape with a waterway and vast skies. The colors, while subdued, are natural and harmonious, primarily greens, grays, and the soft hues of the rainbow. There is nothing visually repulsive, unclean, decaying, grotesque, or morally offensive presented in the artwork. No textures suggest filth or decay, and no forms are distorted in a way that would trigger revulsion. The scene is clean and depicts a natural phenomenon, leaving no room for a feeling of disgust to arise."
rockport-boats-in-a-harbor.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The scene depicted is a picturesque, although perhaps chilly, harbor with boats floating on the water and houses along the shore, covered in a light layer of snow. The water, rendered with vibrant, broken brushstrokes, appears clean and reflects the light beautifully, showing no signs of pollution or stagnation. The boats seem well-maintained, and the buildings, including the distinctive red one, are charming and well-integrated into the landscape. There are no elements of decay, squalor, filth, or anything repulsive. The colors are bright and lively, contributing to an overall impression that is quite pleasing and serene, or at least visually interesting in a positive way. Disgust typically arises from visual cues of contamination, spoilage, or something inherently offensive or repulsive, none of which are present or even hinted at in this artwork."
potato-market-boulevard-des-fosses-pontoise-1882.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. There are no visual elements within the artwork that suggest filth, decay, disease, grotesque imagery, or morally reprehensible acts. The scene depicts an active market, a common and generally benign setting. The figures are engaged in everyday transactions and interactions, and their portrayal is neither repulsive nor disfigured. There is no indication of unsanitary conditions; rather, the baskets appear to hold fresh produce, and the overall atmosphere is one of lively, ordinary activity. The color palette is vibrant and the brushstrokes are energetic, contributing to a dynamic rather than a repulsive aesthetic. Therefore, there are no cues whatsoever to trigger the emotion of disgust."
riverman-1884.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The scene depicts a man in a boat on a body of water, likely a river or lake, surrounded by a vibrant tapestry of floating vegetation and reflections. The colors are bright and varied, dominated by warm yellows, oranges, and greens, interspersed with cooler blues and purples, all applied in distinct, short brushstrokes characteristic of Neo-Impressionism. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, filth, contamination, or any other sensory or moral triggers commonly associated with disgust. The water appears lively and natural, not stagnant or polluted. The vegetation, while dense, is depicted as organic and part of a natural ecosystem, without any repulsive or slimy qualities. The figure himself is engaged in a peaceful, everyday activity, and there is nothing in his portrayal or the overall composition that could be construed as vile, offensive, or physically unpleasant. The entire atmosphere of the painting is one of light, tranquility, and natural beauty, fundamentally opposing any sensation of revulsion."
rbol-ca-do.jpg,impressionism,5.0,"The painting primarily evokes a sense of natural landscape with a striking, gnarled tree. The visual elements present in the artwork do not align with typical triggers for disgust. There is no representation of filth, decay, putrefaction, disease, or anything overtly repulsive to the senses. The colors are earthy and natural, the subject matter is a tree and a pastoral scene, and the overall impression is one of a rustic or wild beauty. While the tree's unusual, contorted form and the apparent broken stump on the right might be seen as somewhat ""ugly"" or ""imperfect"" by some viewers in an aesthetic sense, this does not translate into the visceral reaction of disgust. Disgust is generally associated with strong aversion, often to things that are perceived as unhygienic, contaminated, or morally repugnant, none of which are present in this serene landscape. The slight score of 5 is given only to acknowledge the *extreme* variability of human emotional response, where a very small fraction of individuals *might* experience a minimal, unidentifiable sense of aversion if they find the gnarled nature or perceived 'deformity' of the tree profoundly unsettling on a subconscious level, akin to a mild unease rather than true disgust. However, objectively, there are no elements intended to provoke or likely to provoke disgust."
rocky-coast-1896.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a landscape depicting a rocky coastline, evokes no discernible sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by things that are foul, repulsive, contaminated, decaying, or morally abhorrent. This artwork presents a natural scene: large, rugged rocks meeting the sea, with waves breaking on a sandy shore under a muted sky. The colors are earthy and natural (browns, greys, blues, whites), and the subject matter is a serene and powerful representation of nature. There are no elements within the painting that suggest filth, decay, gore, contamination, disease, or anything unpleasant that would provoke a visceral feeling of revulsion. The water appears dynamic and clean, the rocks are solid and enduring, and the overall impression is one of natural beauty and tranquility rather than anything repugnant. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate as there is nothing in the imagery that would elicit disgust."
roses-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a beautiful floral arrangement, likely of roses or peonies, rendered in soft, warm colors. The brushwork is loose and impressionistic, conveying a sense of natural beauty and tranquility. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that could conceivably evoke disgust. The subject matter is inherently pleasant and aesthetically appealing. There is no representation of decay, disease, contamination, filth, or any grotesque or repulsive imagery. The colors are harmonious, the forms are organic and gentle, and the overall mood is serene and inviting. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with spoilage, impurity, or things that threaten well-being, none of which are present here. The extremely low score reflects the complete absence of any characteristics that might trigger such a negative emotional response. The slight deviation from a perfect zero is merely a theoretical allowance, as a perfect zero might imply a complete lack of any sensation, which isn't strictly applicable to human emotional responses to art, but practically speaking, this painting is diametrically opposed to any feeling of disgust."
roses-fruit-wine-1912.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes disgust. The artwork is a vibrant still life, depicting lush flowers, fresh fruit, a bottle of what appears to be champagne or wine, and a glass of red wine on a table. The colors are rich and appealing, primarily featuring various shades of pinks, reds, greens, yellows, and oranges, set against a dark, natural background. All the elements — the ripe fruit (lemons, oranges, grapes, apples), the blooming roses, and the beverages — appear fresh, inviting, and wholesome. There are no signs of decay, spoilage, dirt, or anything unappetizing or repulsive. The composition is aesthetically pleasing, and the subject matter is traditionally associated with abundance, beauty, and enjoyment, rather than any negative or aversive emotions."
roman-architecture.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts an architectural interior or exterior, likely a classical or Baroque structure, characterized by columns, arches, and strong light and shadow contrasts. There are no elements within the artwork that evoke a sense of disgust. The surfaces, though rendered with visible brushstrokes, appear to be stone or plaster, which are clean and structurally sound, not decaying, rotting, or covered in anything unsanitary. There are no grotesque figures, disturbing textures, or scenes of violence, illness, or squalor that would typically trigger a feeling of revulsion or nausea. The interplay of light and shadow, while creating depth and atmosphere, does not highlight any repellent details. The overall impression is one of grandeur, light, and architectural beauty, entirely devoid of any visual cues associated with disgust."
rowlandson-house-sunset-1912.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes a feeling of disgust. The scene depicts a landscape with buildings and foliage, rendered in a painterly style with muted colors. There are no elements of decay, filth, gore, unpleasant bodily functions, moral depravity, or anything visually offensive that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or strong aversion. The subject matter is neutral, depicting a cityscape or garden view, and the artistic execution, while perhaps somber or serene to some, carries no inherent repulsive qualities. The work is devoid of any content that would typically be associated with the emotion of disgust."
roses-in-a-vase.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting is a vibrant and aesthetically pleasing still life depicting a bouquet of flowers in a vase. The colors are rich and harmonious, the composition is balanced, and the subject matter—fresh flowers—is generally associated with beauty and pleasantness. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, rot, unhygienic conditions, unpleasant textures, or any form of repulsive imagery that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust. The brushwork, while impressionistic and loose, does not create an effect of grittiness or unpleasantness. There is absolutely nothing visually or thematically present that would evoke a feeling of revulsion or strong aversion. The very slight score above zero acknowledges the subjective nature of emotional response, but practically, this painting is devoid of any qualities that would realistically induce disgust in a viewer."
rua-de-barbizon-1879.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting does not elicit any feelings of disgust. It depicts a tranquil, natural scene with trees, a pathway, and a building, possibly a home or a church, with a few figures present. The color palette is composed of natural greens, earthy browns, and muted sky tones, none of which are jarring or unpleasant. There are no elements that suggest decay, filth, disease, moral corruption, or anything physically repulsive. The subject matter is benign and depicts a peaceful, perhaps idyllic, rural or village setting. There is nothing in the composition, brushwork, or depicted scene that would trigger a visceral or cognitive response of revulsion or aversion."
rue-caulaincourt-mills-on-montmarte-1884.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""Street in Montmartre (Impasse des Deux Frères and the Lepeudt Mill), Paris"" by Vincent van Gogh, does not evoke any sense of disgust. The subject matter – a street scene with windmills, a fence, a lamppost, and a tree – is entirely neutral and offers nothing that could be considered repulsive, grotesque, or unclean. The artistic style, characterized by vibrant, expressive brushstrokes and a bold use of color (such as the striking yellow foreground and varied greens and purples in the background fields), is dynamic and engaging rather than off-putting. There are no depictions of decay, filth, violence, or any elements typically associated with eliciting a feeling of disgust. The scene is an idealized or impressionistic view of a landscape, emphasizing light and color, which tend to inspire feelings of contemplation or appreciation rather than revulsion. Therefore, there is no aspect of the artwork that would trigger this emotion."
roquefort.jpg,impressionism,5.0,"The emotion of disgust is very minimally evoked by this painting. The primary, and indeed only, potential source of even a mild aversion could stem from the depiction of the blue cheese under the glass cloche. For individuals who have a strong personal dislike or aversion to mold, even when it is a deliberate and integral part of a food item like blue cheese, there might be a fleeting, low-level sensation of disgust. However, the cheese is presented in a typical manner, not showing signs of spoilage beyond its characteristic blue veins, which are an expected feature of this delicacy. There is no emphasis on unpleasant textures, odors (which are obviously not present in a static image), or any visual cues that would suggest rot, decay, filth, or unhygienic conditions. The other elements in the painting—the bottle, the glass of liquid, the knife, and the wooden table—are depicted neutrally and offer no discernible triggers for disgust. The overall impression is that of a quiet still life, often associated with a pleasant meal, which generally contradicts feelings of disgust. Any such reaction would be highly subjective and limited to a very specific sensory sensitivity to certain food textures or appearances, rather than a universal or intended emotional response."
rouen-cathedral-sunlight-effect.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, one of Claude Monet's iconic Rouen Cathedral series, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is typically elicited by something repulsive, offensive, or a visual representation of decay, filth, or the grotesque. This artwork, however, is a masterful study of light and atmosphere on a monumental architectural subject.

The subject itself, a grand cathedral, is inherently sublime and often associated with awe and reverence, not repulsion. Monet's characteristic Impressionistic brushwork, while thick and broken, creates a vibrant tapestry of color and light rather than a depiction of grime or deterioration. The palette is dominated by cool blues and purples in the shadows, contrasted with warm yellows and oranges where the light strikes the stone, all contributing to an ethereal and luminous effect. There are no sickly colors, disturbing forms, or narrative elements that would suggest anything unpleasant or offensive.

The very essence of the painting is an exploration of the fleeting beauty of light and the enduring presence of the structure, rendered with an aesthetic sensitivity that is antithetical to any sensation of disgust. The texture, while palpable due to the impasto technique, speaks of painted surface and the play of light, not decay or unappealing tactile qualities. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing within this image that would trigger a feeling of disgust in the viewer."
russian-dancers.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There are absolutely no elements within this painting that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The artwork depicts a group of women, possibly dancing or frolicking in a field, adorned with floral wreaths. The colors are bright and harmonious, featuring vibrant yellows, greens, blues, and warm earthy tones, all contributing to a pleasant and idyllic atmosphere. The figures themselves appear clean and wholesome, dressed in light, flowing garments, and their general demeanor suggests joy and innocence. There is no depiction of decay, filth, disease, violence, grotesque imagery, or anything that is inherently repulsive or offensive. The natural setting is rendered with soft pastels, creating a gentle and inviting scene. Consequently, the painting entirely lacks any visual cues, subject matter, or aesthetic qualities that would trigger an emotional response of disgust."
scene-along-a-dutch-river.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes the emotion of disgust. The scene depicted is a tranquil landscape, likely a canal or river with a moored boat in the foreground, reeds along the banks, and in the distance, a sailboat and a windmill under a pale, serene sky. The colors are muted and harmonious, predominantly shades of green, blue, and grey, contributing to a calm and peaceful atmosphere. There are no elements that are foul, repulsive, offensive, or morally objectionable. The subject matter is natural and picturesque, the artistic style is painterly but not messy or unsettling in a way that would trigger revulsion. The painting conveys a sense of quietude and possibly a touch of melancholic beauty, but it completely lacks any visual cues that would lead to a sensation of disgust."
rue-norvins-place-du-tertre-montmartre.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting does not elicit any discernible sense of disgust. There are no elements within the artwork that trigger a visceral or psychological repulsion. Common artistic triggers for disgust, such as depictions of decay, filth, disease, grotesque bodily forms, violence, or morally repugnant acts, are entirely absent. The scene portrays a bustling, albeit damp, street in what appears to be a European city, with people walking, a horse-drawn carriage, and various shops with illuminated windows. The wet street, reflecting lights, conveys an atmospheric quality rather than one of grime or unsanitary conditions. The figures are rendered impressionistically and do not display any deformities, suffering, or behaviors that would be considered offensive or revolting. The architecture and overall environment appear ordinary and functional, without any signs of squalor or neglect that might lead to feelings of disgust. The color palette, while somewhat muted with grays and browns, is complemented by warm interior glows, contributing to a generally neutral or even inviting, albeit somewhat melancholic, atmosphere, entirely devoid of anything that would provoke an adverse emotional reaction of disgust."
spring-1890.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting presents a serene and idyllic landscape featuring a calm river, lush green fields, and distant hills under a clear sky. The color palette is composed of natural, harmonious tones, predominantly greens, blues, and yellows, with touches of earthy reds and browns in the foliage. There are no elements within the scene that are visually unappealing, unclean, decaying, or indicative of anything offensive or morally repugnant. The figures by the water appear to be engaged in leisure, contributing to the peaceful atmosphere. There is an absolute absence of any subject matter, texture, or color combination that would typically trigger a sensation of revulsion or disgust. The painting evokes feelings of tranquility and natural beauty, leaving no room for such a negative emotional response."
seville-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This watercolor painting depicts a quaint urban scene, likely a street or plaza flanked by buildings. The artistic style is loose and impressionistic, characteristic of watercolor, with vibrant yet harmonious colors. The subject matter is entirely benign: architecture, balconies, windows, and a street scene. There are no elements within the painting that typically trigger disgust, such as graphic depictions of bodily fluids, decay, filth, injury, suffering, or grotesque imagery. The buildings appear aged but well-maintained or charmingly rustic, rather than dilapidated or squalid. The colors are bright and inviting, and the overall atmosphere is one of pleasantness and warmth. There is absolutely nothing in the visual content, composition, or artistic execution that could be construed as repulsive or sickening. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is completely absent."
southern-france-beach.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, with its vibrant colors, sunny disposition, and relaxed figures, evokes feelings of warmth, tranquility, and perhaps nostalgia for a pleasant summer day. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that could be interpreted as disgusting. The subject matter depicts a serene coastal or beach scene with people enjoying their time under the shade of pine trees. The figures are depicted simply, without any grotesque features or disturbing actions. The environment is clean and open, with no signs of decay, squalor, or any other unsanitary or repulsive conditions. The color palette is earthy and natural, dominated by greens, blues, and warm browns, none of which are used in a way that would suggest illness, grime, or any other visual cue for disgust. The overall aesthetic is one of harmony and pleasantness, completely devoid of any stimuli that might trigger a feeling of repulsion or strong aversion."
sky-at-sunset.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, an atmospheric landscape rendered with visible, textured brushstrokes, depicts a natural scene that appears to be a beach or coastline at either sunrise or sunset. The color palette primarily consists of warm, muted tones of orange, brown, and grey in the sky, transitioning to similar earthy tones in the foreground and middle ground, with hints of cooler blues and purples. There are small, indistinct figures that seem to be human forms on the shore. Absolutely nothing within the imagery suggests decay, filth, disease, moral repugnance, or any other quality that would typically elicit a feeling of disgust. The subject matter is serene and contemplative, and while the artistic style is loose and expressionistic, it does not lend itself to any interpretation as repulsive or offensive. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate, as the painting contains no elements capable of provoking disgust."
south-boston-pier.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a vibrant and pleasant public scene, likely a boardwalk or pier, with numerous figures, including adults and children. There is absolutely nothing within the imagery, subject matter, or artistic style that could evoke the emotion of disgust. The figures are generally well-dressed and engaged in what appears to be leisure activities. There are no elements of decay, filth, gore, violence, explicit bodily functions, or any other traditionally recognized triggers for disgust. The colors are warm and inviting, and the overall impression is one of a lively, harmless, and even charming social gathering. The painting is entirely devoid of any visual cues that would incite revulsion or abhorrence."
spring-at-pontoise-1872.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a quiet landscape with houses and trees, presents no visual elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The subject matter is benign and commonplace, showing a rural or semi-urban scene with buildings, bare trees suggesting a cooler season, and a few figures engaged in ordinary activities. There is nothing in the composition that is dirty, repulsive, grotesque, violent, or morally objectionable. The color palette is naturalistic and earthy, dominated by browns, greens, and blues, which are not jarring or unpleasant. The brushwork is characteristic of impressionism, providing texture and life to the scene rather than creating anything unsightly. Therefore, based on the visual content and artistic style, there are no perceptible cues that would trigger a sensation of revulsion or strong disapproval typically associated with disgust."
spring-morning-pontoise-1874.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting is a serene and idyllic landscape scene, characteristic of the Impressionist movement. It depicts lush green fields, various trees, a clear blue sky with soft clouds, and distant figures and animals (likely cows). There is absolutely nothing within the subject matter, composition, or artistic execution of this painting that could possibly evoke a feeling of disgust. The colors are natural and harmonious, the light is bright and inviting, and the overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and natural beauty. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, unsettling, decaying, unsanitary, or morally objectionable. None of these qualities are present here; the scene is wholesome, pleasant, and aesthetically pleasing, offering no visual cues or narrative elements that would cause revulsion or aversion."
saint-tropez.jpg,impressionism,1.25,"The painting, depicting weathered shacks by a body of water, evokes practically no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues of decay, filth, contamination, or things that are overtly unsanitary or repulsive. While the shacks are depicted as old and somewhat dilapidated with rusty roofs and weathered wood, this primarily conveys a sense of age, rustic charm, or perhaps neglect, rather than a feeling of revulsion. The rough, uneven terrain in the foreground, with its earthy tones and visible brushstrokes, suggests an unkempt or natural environment, but it does not appear to be dirty, putrid, or contaminated. There are no elements within the scene—no waste, no visible rot beyond natural weathering, no grotesque forms, and no suggestion of foul odors—that would trigger a strong, or even moderate, physiological or emotional response of disgust. The overall impression is more one of quiet observation of a humble, rural landscape. Any minimal score reflects only the most tenuous and subjective association some viewers might make between disrepair or lack of pristine order and a very, very faint, almost imperceptible sense of things being ""unclean"" or ""worn out,"" which is a far cry from true disgust."
spring-morning.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically provoked by things that are perceived as unclean, decaying, foul, offensive, or intrinsically repulsive, either physically or morally. This artwork, a landscape depicting a body of water, hills, and trees, portrays a natural scene. There are no elements of decay, pollution, filth, or any subject matter that could be considered unsanitary, grotesque, or morally objectionable. The colors, while varied and somewhat muted, are harmonious and natural, not sickly or jarring. The texture and brushwork do not convey any sense of physical revulsion. The overall impression is one of nature, without any specific details that would trigger an aversion response. Therefore, the emotional register for disgust remains entirely unactivated by this image."
still-life-with-pomegranates.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a still life depicting a bowl of fruit on a draped cloth, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subject matter itself—common fruits like pomegranates, quinces, and possibly apples or pears, along with nuts or seeds—is inherently wholesome and non-repugnant. The fruit appears ripe and in good condition; specifically, the pomegranate that is split open reveals its vibrant red arils, signifying ripeness and abundance rather than decay or spoilage. There are no visual cues of rot, mold, infestation, or unpleasant odors. The colors are warm and inviting, the composition is balanced, and the textures are rendered in a manner that conveys the natural forms of the objects. The white cloth appears clean. There is nothing unsanitary, grotesque, or unappetizing depicted that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion. The painting is a serene and pleasant representation of natural bounty."
street-from-bretania-1.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"There is virtually no element within this painting that could evoke a feeling of disgust. The subject matter depicts a charming, sun-drenched street scene with traditional buildings, which is generally aesthetically pleasing and benign. The color palette is warm and inviting, dominated by creams, yellows, oranges, and earthy browns, which are far from sickly, decaying, or unappetizing hues. The brushwork is soft and impressionistic, lending a gentle quality rather than harshness or grotesque detail. There are no disturbing figures, no signs of decay, filth, or any unsanitary conditions. The presence of flower boxes in some windows even adds a touch of life and pleasantness. Disgust is typically a response to something perceived as repulsive, unhygienic, or morally repugnant, none of which apply to this serene and somewhat idyllic portrayal of a town street. The score is not an absolute zero only because, theoretically, any visual stimulus could be disliked by someone for idiosyncratic reasons, but objectively, this painting offers no basis for the emotion of disgust."
strand-in-trouville-1863.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is a pleasant and typical beach landscape, featuring individuals strolling, a horse and rider, and a building adorned with flags, all under a vast sky. There are no elements within the composition that are inherently repulsive, grotesque, unsanitary, violent, or morally objectionable. The colors, while somewhat muted, are natural and harmonious, contributing to a calm and leisurely atmosphere rather than a discordant or sickening one. The figures are rendered in an impressionistic style, but none possess features or actions that would incite revulsion. The overall impression is one of normalcy and gentle activity, entirely devoid of any visual cues that would trigger feelings of aversion or loathing."
summer-1896.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a serene and idyllic scene of people, primarily children, bathing and playing in the shallow waters of the sea. There are no elements within the artwork that evoke feelings of revulsion, repulsion, or strong disapproval. The colors are soft and natural, the figures are rendered in a harmonious and unthreatening manner, and the activity itself (bathing) is commonplace and innocent. There is no implied filth, decay, violence, moral transgression, or any other visual or thematic cue that would trigger a sensation of disgust. The overall impression is one of tranquility, natural beauty, and a gentle depiction of human life, which stands in direct opposition to any feeling of disgust."

There are no signs of decay, spoilage, infestation, or unhygienic conditions. The colors are rich and vibrant, contributing to an inviting and rustic atmosphere, rather than anything sickly or repellent. While the brushstrokes are visible and the texture is painterly, this artistic interpretation does not translate into a repulsive tactile sensation. There is nothing messy, chaotic, or unsettling in the composition that would trigger an aversion response. Overall, the image conveys a sense of earthy beauty and still life tranquility, making any notion of disgust entirely absent."
strong-wind-gust-of-wind.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a vibrant and serene landscape, elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by something repulsive, offensive, unclean, or morally objectionable, leading to a strong aversion. There is nothing within the subject matter – rolling green hills, lush trees, and a luminous, cloud-filled sky – that could possibly evoke such a response. The colors are natural and harmonious, primarily greens, blues, and whites, which are generally perceived as calming and pleasing. The loose, expressive brushwork, characteristic of Impressionism, conveys a sense of natural vitality and light, rather than anything chaotic, decaying, or unsanitary. There are no disturbing elements, no signs of decay, pollution, or anything visually unpleasant that would trigger an instinctual feeling of repulsion. The overall impression is one of beauty, freshness, and tranquility, directly antithetical to any sensation of disgust."
sunset-1.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that would evoke a sense of disgust. The artwork presents a serene landscape, likely a sunrise or sunset over a body of water with distant mountains. The color palette, composed of warm oranges, earthy browns, calming blues, and muted greens, is harmonious and suggestive of natural beauty rather than anything unpleasant. The subject matter itself—a tranquil natural scene with light reflecting on water—is universally perceived as beautiful or peaceful, not repulsive. There are no disturbing textures, grotesque figures, themes of decay, filth, or anything that triggers an aversion response. The expressive brushstrokes and the abstract quality of the reflections contribute to an aesthetic experience that is far removed from any sensation of revulsion or distaste."

The scene depicted is a vibrant and serene garden on what appears to be a sunny day, with a person admiring a lush bed of white roses and yellow sunflowers. The colors are bright and natural, dominated by various greens, clear blues, and cheerful yellows and whites, all contributing to an uplifting and pleasant atmosphere. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, filth, unpleasant odors, disease, or any other visual cues typically associated with disgust. The flowers are in full bloom, the foliage is healthy, and the landscape is expansive and clean. The subject matter is inherently beautiful and tranquil, presenting a harmonious view of nature and leisure. The light brushstrokes and soft impressionistic style further enhance the pleasantness rather than introducing any jarring or repulsive textures. Therefore, any feeling of disgust is absent."
tennis-game-by-the-sea-1901.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a tennis match by the sea, offers absolutely no visual elements that would evoke a feeling of disgust. The scene is one of genteel recreation, with individuals engaged in sport and spectators observing. The colors used are natural and serene, primarily greens, blues, and muted earth tones, none of which are sickly, jarring, or associated with decay or unpleasantness. The figures are dressed in clean, period-appropriate attire, and their poses and interactions are entirely wholesome and devoid of any suggestion of unsanitary conditions, moral corruption, injury, illness, or anything that could be considered repulsive or offensive. The environment, a grassy court by the sea under a cloudy sky, appears clean and fresh. There are no disturbing textures, foul substances, or unsettling details in the brushwork or composition that could trigger revulsion. The overall impression is one of pleasant outdoor activity and tranquility, entirely antithetical to the emotion of disgust."
the-bathing-hour-1910.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust.

There is no depiction of filth, decay, violence, bodily fluids, unhygienic conditions, or morally reprehensible actions. The colors are muted but not sickly or nauseating, and the artistic style, characterized by loose brushwork, does not present any distorted or unpleasant forms that might trigger revulsion. The overall impression is one of a somewhat somber or everyday scene, which, while perhaps not overtly cheerful, contains absolutely no visual information that would provoke the emotion of disgust. The score is a negligible 0.5 rather than a perfect 0, simply to acknowledge the subjective nature of emotional response, but functionally, there is nothing in this image to induce disgust."
the-clearing-in-the-woods-1913.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely no element within this painting that elicits a feeling of disgust. The scene depicts a serene and picturesque winter landscape, characterized by pristine white snow covering the ground and mountains, bare trees, and a small, rustic cabin. The colors are predominantly cool blues and purples, creating a tranquil and somewhat ethereal atmosphere, which is complemented by the soft light. Disgust is typically evoked by something repulsive, offensive, unclean, or morally repugnant. None of these qualities are present here. The snow appears fresh and untouched, the trees, though bare, are part of the natural cycle, and the overall composition conveys peace and quietude. There are no disturbing figures, no signs of decay or squalor, and no visual textures or forms that would trigger revulsion. The painting evokes a sense of calm, beauty, and perhaps a touch of solitude, but certainly not disgust."
the-coast-at-sainte-adresse.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting by Claude Monet depicts a serene coastal landscape with cliffs, a beach, and boats on the water under a cloudy, possibly sunset or sunrise sky. There is absolutely nothing within the subject matter, color palette, or composition of this artwork that could evoke a feeling of disgust. The scene is natural and tranquil, presenting a view of the sea and land without any elements that are offensive, grotesque, repulsive, or unclean. The colors are warm and earthy, depicting a typical landscape, and the figures in the boat are simply part of the scene, engaging in an innocuous activity. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely unrepresented and unprovoked by this artwork."
the-coastguard-cabin-at-varengeville.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"This painting evokes virtually no sense of disgust. The subject matter itself – a serene coastal landscape with a charming house perched on a hill, overlooking the vast sea, and surrounded by lush, light-colored foliage – is inherently beautiful and tranquil. There are no elements within the composition that are dirty, repulsive, offensive, or visually unpleasant in a way that would trigger a feeling of disgust. The colors used are soft and harmonious, predominantly blues, purples, greens, and whites, contributing to a sense of calm and natural beauty rather than any form of aversion. The impressionistic brushwork, while abstracting forms, does not introduce any unsettling textures or details that could be perceived as unpleasant or grotesque. There are no depicted signs of decay, squalor, or any physical or moral offensiveness. The overall feeling conveyed by the artwork is one of peace, natural wonder, and perhaps admiration, all of which are diametrically opposed to disgust. The score is not an absolute zero only because, as a human experience, a fractional, almost imperceptible, flicker of any emotion might theoretically be present, but in a practically negligible sense that does not register as actual disgust."
the-cowherd.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is a peaceful, pastoral landscape featuring a cow grazing in a field and a person resting under trees in the background. The colors are soft and natural, predominantly greens and earthy tones, which contribute to a tranquil atmosphere. There are no elements within the artwork that suggest decay, filth, disease, gore, or anything visually repulsive. The subjects, a healthy-looking cow and a neatly dressed individual, are presented without any characteristics that would trigger an aversion response. The setting is clean and open, devoid of any narrative or visual cues that could be interpreted as unhygienic or morally offensive. Consequently, the painting registers a complete absence of disgust."
the-greenhouse-1876.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, depicting a vibrant and flourishing garden, evokes feelings of beauty, tranquility, and natural abundance, none of which align with disgust. The scene is filled with lush green foliage and an array of colorful roses, predominantly reds, pinks, and whites, all rendered with an impressionistic softness that is visually pleasing. The light, bright palette and the depiction of a well-tended and active garden environment, complete with greenhouses in the background, suggest a healthy and thriving space. There are no elements within the composition—no decay, no filth, no grotesque imagery, no jarring or sickly colors, nor any disturbing subject matter—that would provoke a sensation of revulsion or distaste. The overall impression is one of serene natural beauty and pleasantness, making the evocation of disgust entirely absent."
the-cascade.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting depicts a natural scene of a waterfall, a subject matter that is inherently beautiful and often associated with feelings of awe, tranquility, or invigoration, rather than disgust. There are absolutely no visual cues within the artwork that would trigger a sensation of disgust. The water is rendered with vibrant whites and blues, conveying cleanliness, movement, and freshness, entirely devoid of any suggestion of pollution, stagnation, or contamination. The surrounding rocks and vegetation appear natural and healthy, lacking any signs of decay, rot, grime, or repulsive textures that might induce a visceral negative reaction. There are no elements that imply unsanitary conditions, unpleasant odors, or anything unsightly or repulsive to the senses. The brushwork, characteristic of impressionism, captures the dynamic flow and light of the scene, enhancing its natural beauty rather than introducing any disturbing or off-putting elements. As such, the emotional response of disgust is virtually non-existent when viewing this particular artwork."
the-japanese-bridge-the-water-lily-pond-1899.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of disgust, I find absolutely no elements within Monet's ""Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies"" that evoke such a feeling. Disgust is typically elicited by things that are repulsive, decaying, unsanitary, or morally offensive. This painting presents the antithesis of these qualities. The scene is one of vibrant natural beauty: lush green foliage, delicate water lilies floating on reflective water, and a gracefully arched bridge. The colors are fresh and harmonious, predominantly various shades of green and blue, with touches of pink and white in the blossoms. The impressionistic brushwork, while abstracting forms, conveys a sense of light, movement, and the living quality of the pond and its surroundings, rather than anything morbid or putrefying. There is no visual indication of stagnation, rot, filth, or any unsavory aspect often associated with disgust. The tranquil atmosphere, the clean lines of the bridge, and the blooming vitality of the water lilies all contribute to an overwhelmingly pleasant and serene aesthetic experience. Consequently, there is no sensory or conceptual trigger for disgust in this masterful depiction of Monet's garden."
the-lady-pianist.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a delicate watercolor, depicts a serene and elegant scene of a woman playing a musical instrument in a richly appointed room. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that evoke physical revulsion, moral outrage leading to a feeling of nausea, or any sense of contamination, decay, or putrefaction. The subject matter is aesthetically pleasing, featuring graceful figures, ornate furnishings, and classical artistic motifs in the background. The colors are warm and harmonious, and the overall atmosphere is one of peaceful refinement and artistry. The long, flowing fabric of the woman's dress on the floor, while perhaps appearing slightly disheveled, is clearly part of the garment's luxurious design and not indicative of dirt or squalor. A tiny white object on the floor near the chair might be a dropped flower or a piece of trim, but it is too indistinct and minor to trigger any feeling of disgust. The quality of light and the artist's technique further contribute to an overall impression of beauty and tranquility. Thus, the painting contains no visual cues that would trigger a physiological or psychological response associated with disgust."
the-louvre-1902.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, an Impressionistic landscape, offers absolutely no visual cues or thematic elements that would evoke disgust. The scene depicts a serene urban landscape, likely Paris, featuring the Seine River, a bridge, distant architecture (possibly the Louvre), bare trees, and a few small figures and boats. The color palette is soft and natural, dominated by muted blues, grays, and browns, with hints of warm light in the sky. There are no grotesque figures, decaying objects, unsanitary conditions, violent acts, or anything morally repugnant present in the composition. The river appears clean and reflective, the buildings are grand and iconic, and the sparse winter trees convey a sense of calm rather than decay. The small human figures are indistinct and integrated into the peaceful scene, offering no narrative of suffering or revulsion. The overall impression is one of tranquil observation and aesthetic appreciation, leaving no room for a visceral reaction of disgust. The score is minimally above zero to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association, but objectively, the painting presents nothing offensive to the senses or sensibilities."
the-pont-neuf-1902.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a bustling cityscape, primarily evokes feelings of vibrancy, activity, and perhaps a sense of the grandeur of urban life at the turn of the century. There is absolutely nothing in its subject matter, composition, or artistic execution that would elicit disgust. The scene depicts a lively street with numerous people and carriages on a bridge, under a bright sky with clouds. The buildings are well-rendered, and the overall impression is one of movement and light. There are no elements of squalor, decay, gore, disease, filth, moral offense, or anything visually or thematically repulsive that would trigger a sensation of disgust. The brushwork, while visible, is not chaotic or unpleasant; it serves to capture the impression of light and form. The colors are natural and harmonious. Therefore, no aspect of this artwork contributes to or provokes the emotion of disgust."
the-reading-1869.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""The Balcony"" by Édouard Manet, presents a scene devoid of any elements that could reasonably evoke the emotion of disgust. The subjects are depicted in a relaxed and contemplative manner, with their expressions ranging from a direct, somewhat reserved gaze (the seated woman) to an absorbed, introspective posture (the man). There are no visual cues such as unpleasant textures, grotesque imagery, signs of decay, or any form of repulsive subject matter. The color palette, dominated by greens, whites, and earthy tones, is harmonious and does not feature any sickly or jarring combinations that might induce a feeling of discomfort or revulsion. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of calm observation and psychological presence, completely antithetical to the sensation of disgust. Neither the figures' demeanour nor the setting contributes to any feeling of revulsion or strong aversion."
the-thaw-eragny-1893.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, a winter landscape, features snow-covered ground and trees, rendered with visible brushstrokes and a palette dominated by whites, blues, and dark earth tones, characteristic of Impressionistic or Post-Impressionistic style. There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that could evoke a sensation of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by visual cues associated with decay, filth, disease, bodily fluids, grotesque deformity, or unhygienic conditions. The scene depicted is a serene and natural portrayal of winter. The snow appears fresh and clean, the bare trees are a natural part of the seasonal cycle and not depicted in a way that suggests decay or rot, and the overall composition and colors are harmonious and calming rather than jarring or repulsive. There are no disturbing subjects, foul implied textures, or unpleasant visual associations that would incite revulsion. Consequently, the painting registers a complete absence of any feeling of disgust."
the-valley-of-the-scie-at-pouville.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is a serene and natural landscape, featuring a calm river winding through a field with distant hills and scattered trees. The colors are earthy and harmonious, predominantly greens, browns, and blues, which contribute to a tranquil and pastoral atmosphere. There are no elements within the composition that suggest decay, filth, putrefaction, sickness, or anything visually repulsive. The water appears clean, the vegetation healthy, and the distant figures and animals are indistinguishable enough not to convey any negative connotations that might trigger revulsion. The overall impression is one of peaceful rural beauty, which is the antithesis of anything that would elicit a feeling of disgust."
the-moret-bridge-1888.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a naturalistic landscape, presents no visual elements that would reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust. There is an absolute absence of any imagery associated with decay, filth, disease, moral corruption, or anything inherently repulsive. The scene depicts a tranquil river, sturdy trees, an old stone bridge, and a traditional building, all rendered in earthy, muted tones typical of a natural outdoor setting. The water appears flowing and integrated into the landscape, not stagnant or polluted in a way that would be offensive. The foliage is dense but suggests natural growth rather than unkempt neglect that would trigger revulsion. The overall atmosphere is one of calm and natural existence, rather than anything that would trigger a visceral, adverse reaction of disgust. Any minuscule, almost imperceptible fraction of a point might arise only from a highly idiosyncratic or hyper-sensitive interpretation of slightly murky river water or very old buildings, but these are common and not inherently disgusting features. Therefore, the emotion of disgust is virtually non-existent when viewing this artwork."
the-tenth-street-studio-1915.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is an interior, likely a studio or a collector's room, filled with art objects, human figures, and animals. There is nothing in the subject matter that is inherently repulsive or offensive. No elements of filth, decay, disease, bodily fluids, or anything visceral that would typically trigger a sensation of disgust are present. The figures appear to be engaged in a calm, domestic, or conversational setting. The animals (a dog and possibly a cat) are depicted in a natural, benign manner. The artistic style, though loose and impressionistic, does not use colors, forms, or textures that are aesthetically displeasing in a way that would provoke revulsion. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of lived-in comfort and artistic appreciation, far from anything that would evoke a negative emotional response like disgust."
the-valley-of-sasso-sunshine.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, ""The Villa at Bordighera"" by Claude Monet, is a vibrant and serene landscape that evokes feelings of natural beauty and tranquility. There are no visual or thematic elements present that could conceivably trigger an emotion of disgust. The subject matter depicts a lush, sun-drenched environment with abundant vegetation and a peaceful architectural structure nestled within it. The colors are rich and harmonious, dominated by warm greens, yellows, oranges, and reds, suggesting vitality and natural growth rather than decay or blight. The impressionistic brushstrokes, while visible, contribute to the dynamic and lively quality of the scene, not to any sense of unpleasant texture or form. There is no gore, filth, decay, deformity, suffering, or any other traditionally repulsive imagery. The overall impression is one of aesthetic pleasure and a celebration of the natural world, which is entirely antithetical to the sensation of disgust."
tree-in-the-farm-yard-1874.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a serene, ordinary rural or village scene, entirely devoid of any elements typically associated with disgust. There are no depictions of filth, decay, gore, disease, grotesque figures, or any form of physical or moral abomination. The colors are earthy and calm, the setting appears peaceful and lived-in. The brushwork, while loose, does not convey anything unsettling or nauseating. The figures, though indistinct, are simply part of the everyday landscape. There is absolutely nothing within the composition, subject matter, or aesthetic execution that would trigger a sensation of repulsion or revulsion. The score is marginally above zero to acknowledge the theoretical possibility that any visual input, however innocuous, might trigger an idiosyncratic, non-standard reaction in an infinitesimally small fraction of observers, but for any typical viewer, disgust is entirely absent."
trees-in-bloom-1889.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting, ""Spring in Giverny,"" does not evoke any sense of disgust whatsoever. The scene depicts a vibrant and fresh spring landscape, likely an orchard, with trees in various stages of bloom and leafy green. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with soft clouds, and the ground is an earthy brown, suggesting tilled soil. Figures are shown working in the field, contributing to a sense of peaceful industry and harmony with nature. There are no elements within the composition—such as decay, squalor, grotesque figures, unpleasant colors, or disturbing subject matter—that would trigger a visceral reaction of revulsion or distaste. On the contrary, the bright, clean colors, the depiction of natural beauty, and the serene atmosphere are entirely antithetical to the emotion of disgust, promoting feelings of pleasantness and tranquility instead."
valea-agapiei-1915.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subject matter is a charming, verdant landscape with picturesque buildings nestled amongst abundant trees. The colors are natural and vibrant, dominated by lush greens and earthy reds, complemented by a dynamic sky. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, or any unhygienic conditions. The thick impasto technique, while highly textured, conveys a lively, energetic artistic expression rather than suggesting anything physically repulsive or morally objectionable. There are no disturbing elements, unsettling narratives, or unpleasant visual cues that would trigger a feeling of revulsion or aversion. The scene appears fresh, natural, and aesthetically pleasing."
tulip-fields-at-sassenheim-near-leiden-1886.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes absolutely no sense of disgust. The scene depicted is a vibrant and picturesque landscape featuring a rustic house nestled amidst colorful fields of blooming tulips under a bright, airy sky. Disgust is an emotion typically triggered by something offensive, repulsive, unclean, decaying, or morally objectionable. None of these qualities are present in ""Fields of Tulips with the Raan Dorp"" by Claude Monet. The colors are fresh and lively, particularly the reds, yellows, and whites of the flowers, which convey beauty and natural vitality. The thatched roof of the house, while rustic, appears charming and integrated into the landscape, not dilapidated or squalid. The bare trees suggest early spring or late winter, a time of natural dormancy, not decay or unhealthiness. The water in the foreground, though reflecting the earth tones, does not appear stagnant or polluted in a way that would cause repulsion. The overall impression is one of serene beauty, order, and pastoral charm, which is antithetical to any feeling of aversion or revulsion."
two-vases-with-chrysanthems.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"As an art expert evaluating the emotion of disgust in relation to Claude Monet's ""Chrysanthemums,"" I find absolutely no elements within the painting that would evoke such a response. The subject matter itself—two lush, vibrant bouquets of chrysanthemums—is inherently beautiful and decorative, conveying life and abundance rather than decay, disease, or anything rotten or offensive. The Impressionistic style, characterized by its luminous colors and energetic brushwork, further enhances the positive aesthetic experience. The palette is rich with yellows, whites, pinks, blues, and greens, set against a warm, earthy background; these color harmonies are pleasing and inviting, devoid of any sickly, putrid, or unsettling hues that might trigger revulsion. There are no disturbing forms, no unsettling textures (the paint handling is soft and atmospheric, not abrasive or repulsive), nor any narrative implications of foulness or defilement. The composition is balanced and harmonious, contributing to a sense of calm and beauty. In essence, every visual element in this painting works against the sensation of disgust, rendering a score of zero entirely appropriate."
untitled-1885.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a harbor scene with various sailing ships under a cloudy sky. There are no elements within the artwork that evoke a sense of disgust. The subject matter, a bustling port, is a common and generally neutral theme. There is no depiction of decay, filth, pollution, or any visually offensive or repulsive content that would trigger this emotion. The colors are muted and atmospheric, and the brushstrokes, while loose, do not suggest anything inherently unpleasant or sickening. The scene is calm and observational, devoid of any stimuli typically associated with revulsion."
valencia-landscape-1894.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a serene landscape depicting a view over rolling hills from a garden terrace, presents no elements that could reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust. The scene is one of natural beauty and tranquility, featuring lush greenery, blooming roses, a sturdy stone wall, and a expansive vista under a soft sky. There is no representation of decay, filth, deformity, violence, or any other subject matter typically associated with triggering disgust. Aesthetically, the painting employs a harmonious color palette and a balanced composition, offering a visually pleasing experience rather than an aversive one. Therefore, the emotional response to this artwork is entirely devoid of disgust."
two-women-on-the-hillside-1906.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting elicits absolutely no sense of disgust. Disgust is typically evoked by something offensive to the senses, morally repugnant, or physically repulsive, such as decay, bodily fluids, filth, or grotesque imagery. The artwork, however, portrays a serene and rather idyllic pastoral scene. Two figures are depicted at leisure in a sun-drenched, grassy landscape, characterized by fresh greens, tranquil blues, and warm whites. The subject matter itself – people enjoying nature – is inherently pleasant and devoid of any elements that could be considered unsanitary, grotesque, or morally objectionable. Furthermore, the painting's style, with its thick, vibrant brushstrokes (impasto), contributes to its lively and impressionistic quality, rather than suggesting anything unpleasant or chaotic. There are no jarring colors, disturbing forms, or narrative hints that would trigger even a mild feeling of revulsion. The overall impression is one of peace and natural beauty, standing in stark opposition to any sensation of disgust."
valley-bouna-near-bordighera.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, a landscape rendered in an Impressionistic style, features rolling hills, lush green foliage, distinct blue mountains in the background, and a bright, cloud-filled sky. Small clusters of buildings are visible, nestled within the verdant landscape. There is nothing depicted in this artwork that would elicit a feeling of disgust. Disgust is typically triggered by elements that are repulsive, offensive, unhygienic, or morally repugnant. The subject matter—a serene natural vista—is inherently clean, aesthetically pleasing, and devoid of any visual cues that suggest decay, filth, violence, grotesqueness, or anything that would cause aversion or revulsion. The colors are fresh and harmonious, and the brushwork, while visible, contributes to the sense of vibrancy and light, rather than suggesting anything unsettling or unpleasant. Therefore, the painting provides no visual or thematic stimuli to provoke a sensation of disgust. A minimal score is given to acknowledge the remote possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly abstract, non-standard association, but within typical human emotional responses to art, disgust is absent."
valley-of-the-creuse-afternoon-sunlight.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The scene depicted is a natural landscape featuring a body of water winding through hills or cliffs under an open sky. The colors, while varied, are predominantly natural tones of blues, greens, purples, and earthy browns, applied with visible brushstrokes that suggest texture and movement. There are absolutely no elements within the artwork that could be interpreted as unhygienic, putrid, diseased, grotesque, or inherently repulsive. There is no decay, no waste, no unpleasant textures that would provoke a visceral reaction of revulsion. The ruggedness of the terrain and the movement of the water create an atmospheric and somewhat wild impression, but these qualities are far removed from anything that would trigger a feeling of disgust. The painting maintains a dignified and natural aesthetic, completely devoid of any visual cues associated with this emotion."
vase-of-peonies.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, a vibrant still life depicting a bouquet of flowers, primarily in shades of cream, yellow, orange, and pink, set against a muted background, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The subject matter itself—flowers—is inherently associated with beauty, freshness, and natural pleasantness, rather than anything that would trigger revulsion. The colors are lively and harmonious, devoid of any sickly, decaying, or unappetizing tones. The brushwork, though loose and impressionistic, renders the forms of the petals and leaves with a soft vitality, showing no signs of decay, rot, or wilting that might suggest a state of putrefaction. There are no elements within the composition—no unpleasant textures, no suggestive stains, no indication of foulness, contamination, or decay—that could possibly elicit a feeling of disgust. The overall impression is one of visual appeal and natural elegance, making the emotion of disgust completely absent in the viewing experience."
view-of-the-thames-charing-cross-bridge-1874.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, an impressionistic landscape, primarily depicts a hazy urban river scene with boats, bridges, and a distant cityscape. There are no elements within the artwork that evoke a feeling of disgust. The subject matter is entirely neutral in this regard, showing everyday life and the natural/built environment. There is no depiction of decay, filth, bodily fluids, gore, or anything traditionally considered repulsive or offensive to the senses. The muted color palette and atmospheric quality contribute to a calm or contemplative mood rather than one of revulsion. The subtle presence of industrial smoke from distant chimneys is rendered as part of the atmospheric effect rather than as a source of pollution designed to elicit a negative emotional response like disgust. The very slight score of 0.5 acknowledges the theoretical possibility that any image could trigger a minuscule, idiosyncratic negative response in some individual, but objectively, there is nothing in this artwork to provoke disgust."
villa-with-orange-trees-nice.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. The scene depicts a serene and verdant landscape featuring a building nestled among lush trees, some of which are heavily laden with what appear to be ripe citrus fruits. The color palette is vibrant and natural, dominated by greens, blues, and warm earth tones, which are visually appealing and harmonious. The impressionistic brushwork, while loose, conveys a sense of light, air, and natural beauty, rather than anything chaotic, messy, or unclean. There are no elements within the composition that suggest decay, filth, disease, or anything physically repulsive. The fruit appears healthy and abundant, the foliage is full and lively, and the building seems well-integrated into its surroundings without any disturbing features. Disgust typically arises from visual cues associated with contamination, spoilage, or unpleasant physical states, none of which are present or even hinted at in this peaceful and aesthetically pleasing portrayal of nature and architecture.

Therefore, the emotion of disgust is entirely absent when viewing this artwork."
winter.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"The painting depicts a serene, albeit somewhat stark, winter landscape. The foreground is covered in snow, leading towards a line of bare or sparsely leaved trees, with a body of water visible beyond them under a muted sky. There are no elements within this scene that could reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust.

There are no grotesque figures, disturbing scenes, or unsettling narratives that would provoke a feeling of revulsion. The colors, a rich tapestry of greens, yellows, reds, and blues, are applied with an expressive, almost abstract brushwork that captures light and form, but does not suggest decay, putrefaction, or anything unhygienic.

vene-ia-santa-maria-della-salute-1931.jpg,impressionism,5.0,"The painting does not evoke a significant sense of disgust. The subject matter is a scenic, albeit perhaps slightly aged or well-worn, urban canal landscape. There are no elements typically associated with disgust, such as gore, bodily fluids, severe decay, disease, or overt signs of extreme filth or contamination that would trigger a visceral negative reaction. While the water in the foreground does contain dark, murky patches and varied colors that could suggest a lack of pristine clarity, it does not convey a sense of putrefaction or a repulsive stench. The loose, impressionistic style softens any potentially unkempt aspects of the scene, rendering them more atmospheric than appalling. The buildings appear old, but not dilapidated in a way that is sickening. The overall aesthetic is one of artistic interpretation rather than a deliberate attempt to portray anything offensive or repulsive to the senses."
water-lilies-1899-1.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, ""Water Lilies"" by Claude Monet, evokes virtually no sensation of disgust. The subject matter itself—water lilies floating on water—is inherently natural, tranquil, and widely considered beautiful. There are no elements within the composition that would trigger feelings of revulsion, contamination, decay, or filth. The colors, predominantly cool blues and greens, are calming and harmonious, far removed from the sickly or jarring hues often associated with things that induce disgust. There is no depiction of rot, waste, disease, or any organic material in a state of decomposition.

woman-in-kimono-holding-a-japanese-fan-1.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, an interior scene with a woman in a kimono, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. There are no visual elements that suggest filth, decay, unsanitary conditions, bodily fluids, grotesque imagery, or moral repulsion. The colors are muted and harmonious, the subject matter is benign and contemplative, and the objects depicted (a golden bowl, a fan, a framed picture) are decorative or mundane. The brushwork, while visible, does not create any texture that would be associated with something repulsive. The overall impression is one of calm, perhaps introspection, but certainly not one that would trigger any form of revulsion or aversion. The score is a nominal 0.5 rather than an absolute 0 to acknowledge the subjective nature of emotional response, though objectively, there's nothing in this artwork designed to elicit disgust."
woman-wearing-a-hat-in-a-landscape.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"This painting, an Impressionist landscape, evokes no sense of disgust whatsoever. Disgust is typically elicited by something repulsive, unclean, decaying, or morally offensive. Here, the subject matter is a serene and vibrant natural scene – a pond nestled within lush foliage and trees, with a solitary figure observing the environment. The colors are rich and varied, dominated by lively greens and yellows, with accents of blue in the water and a warm red on the woman's attire. The brushstrokes, though loose and visible, contribute to a dynamic and lively atmosphere, not one of decay or unkemptness. There are no signs of putrefaction, filth, disease, or any element that could be perceived as physically or aesthetically repellent.

winterfun-on-de-loswal-hattem-1914.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting depicts a serene winter landscape with people ice skating on a frozen waterway, alongside moored boats and buildings. There are absolutely no elements within this artwork that could reasonably evoke a feeling of disgust. The ice appears clean and suitable for recreation, without any visual cues of contamination, grime, or unpleasant substances. The boats, while appearing weathered and possibly old, show no signs of active decay, putrefaction, or unsanitary conditions; their worn appearance rather contributes to the rustic character of the scene. The figures engaged in skating are portrayed in a natural and pleasant manner, devoid of any physical deformities, injuries, or behaviors that might be considered repulsive. The environment itself, including the buildings and bare trees, is depicted in a tranquil and typical winter aesthetic, without any suggestion of squalor, waste, or anything visually offensive. The color palette is muted and cool, not featuring any sickly or jarring tones. Overall, the subject matter, composition, and visual details are entirely neutral or positive, leaving no room for a sensation of revulsion or disgust. The minimal score of 0.5 is assigned simply to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic or highly unusual personal association that is not inherent to the artwork itself, rather than a true presence of disgust-inducing elements."
woman-putting-on-her-stockings-1895.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that elicits or could be interpreted as a source of disgust. The scene depicts a woman engaged in the mundane, intimate act of adjusting or putting on her socks. Her posture is natural and focused, and her attire is simple and clean. The setting, while rendered with distinct brushstrokes typical of the artist's style, appears to be an ordinary indoor space, possibly a studio or domestic interior, with no visible elements of filth, decay, unhygienic conditions, or anything inherently repulsive. The colors used are warm and earthy, and the overall atmosphere conveyed is one of quiet daily life rather than anything unpleasant or nauseating.

women-s-figures-in-the-park.jpg,impressionism,0.5,"The painting, depicting a vibrant, sun-dappled landscape with figures enjoying a path through the woods, elicits virtually no sense of disgust. Disgust typically arises from visual cues of decay, contamination, filth, moral repugnance, or physical revulsion. None of these elements are present in this artwork. The environment is presented as lush and lively, with healthy foliage and bright, inviting light. The path appears well-trodden but not dirty or offensive. The figures, while depicted with loose brushstrokes typical of the style, appear to be engaged in leisurely, benign activities, offering no narrative or visual cues that would provoke moral or aesthetic revulsion. The overall impression is one of natural beauty and tranquility, which is antithetical to feelings of disgust. Any minimal score is only to acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an idiosyncratic and highly subjective viewer response, but objectively, the painting contains no visual information that would trigger this emotion in a general audience."

The artwork depicts a serene and vibrant garden scene, characterized by lush greenery, flowering rose bushes, and warm, inviting natural light. The subject matter itself – a beautiful, flourishing garden – is inherently devoid of any elements typically associated with disgust, such as decay, filth, disease, violence, or anything grotesque or repulsive. The colors employed are harmonious and natural, dominated by earthy greens, warm browns, and the soft pinks and creams of the roses, all contributing to a pleasant and aesthetically pleasing visual experience. The brushwork, typical of Impressionism, is loose and lively, conveying a sense of vitality rather than stagnation or decay. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of peaceful beauty and natural abundance, offering no visual or thematic cues that would trigger revulsion or aversion."
zimsko-jutro-1911.jpg,impressionism,0.0,"There is absolutely nothing in this painting that evokes a feeling of disgust. The artwork features a muted landscape, likely depicting buildings in a wintery or foggy atmosphere, rendered with heavy impasto brushstrokes. The color palette consists predominantly of cool blues, grays, and earthy browns, which are serene and subdued rather than repulsive. The textures, while prominent, convey a sense of material substance and atmosphere, not decay, contamination, or anything unhygienic. The subject matter itself – simple architectural forms under a vast sky – is benign and lacks any disturbing or offensive elements. There are no grotesque figures, scenes of violence, signs of illness, or anything visually unpleasant that would trigger revulsion or nausea. The overall impression is one of quietude, perhaps melancholia, or the harshness of winter, but not one that would lead to a feeling of disgust."
young-girl-in-the-fields.jpg,impressionism,0.1,"The painting does not evoke any sense of disgust. The scene depicts a solitary figure in a field under a vast sky, likely a harvested landscape given the yellow-brown tones and shapes that could be hay bales or remnants of crops. The colors are earthy and natural, predominantly yellows, ochres, and muted greens and blues. There are no visual elements suggestive of decay, filth, disease, moral depravity, or anything that would typically trigger a revulsion response. The subject matter is benign and pastoral. While the indistinct rendering of the figure might lend a slight sense of anonymity or contemplation, it does not cross into anything grotesque or unwholesome. The brushstrokes, though visible, contribute to the texture and artistic style rather than implying any unpleasantness. The overall impression is one of quiet observation of nature and human presence within it, entirely devoid of characteristics that induce disgust. A very slight, almost negligible score is given only to reflect the absolute impossibility of assigning a perfect zero in subjective emotional responses, but for all practical purposes, disgust is absent here."
